Monday on Fox News Channel’s “America’s Newsroom,” “MediaBuzz” host Howard Kurtz said the media in now so aggressively going after Republican presidential nominee Donald Trump in the last 10 days it has reassembled a “mob hit. ”  Kurtz said, “The obvious distaste boarding on disgust that many journalists as well as commentators have for Donald Trump, he was able to defeat that in the primaries but, it has been going on for quite a while. But in the last 10 days almost like the press put out a mob hit on Donald Trump. The imbalance is so overwhelming on almost every media site and outlet that it can no longer be denied. ” He continued, “A lot of journalists who also talk to other friend who also think that Donald Trump is a bit unhinged, feel that Trump is so dangerous, and such a threat to our western civilization and such unimaginable president in their view, that they feel that it is almost their patriotic duty to take him down. And if you want to do that, fine but then you can’t say you’re a journalist. You’re a partisan. ” Follow Pam Key on Twitter @pamkeyNEN
