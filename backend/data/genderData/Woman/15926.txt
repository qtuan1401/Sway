Sunday on ABC’s “This Week,” while discussing Green Party presidential nominee Jill Stein initiating recounts of the presidential vote in the swing states of Michigan, Pennsylvania and Wisconsin, and Democratic presidential nominee Hillary Clinton supporting the effort, the host of the liberal online program “The Young Turks” Cenk Uygur said the Trump team seems “jittery” about the recount.  Uygur said, “A recount is a perfectly normal part of the process. If you go outside of the process, I would be with you. We were on Trump for doing that. I totally agree it would be hypocritical. But if you’re within a percent and there are rules in every state on this, perfectly right to call for a recount. You know, i saw the interview earlier in the show. I don’t know why they’re so nervous. They’re just so jittery about it. No recount, no recount. Don’t do a recount. If you think you won, the recount will show the same thing. ” Follow Pam Key on Twitter @pamkeyNEN
