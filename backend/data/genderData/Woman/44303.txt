’  ’ ”   The timing of Syrian President Bashar Assad’s chemical attack on   his own people probably wasn’t an accident. ” ”   Assad’s military launched its brutal attack on civilians  —   using   substances he had vowed to get rid of under a deal struck with   Russia and the Obama administration in 2013  —   mere months after   US President Donald Trump took office. ” ”   Now Trump has sent a signal that Assad’s actions won’t go   unpunished. ” ’   On Thursday night, the US  on Shayrat airfield   and nearby Syrian military infrastructure in response to the   chemical attack that killed at least 80 people in the   northwestern part of the country on Tuesday. ’ ”   Steven Cook, a senior fellow at the Council on Foreign Relations,   said Assad’s latest attack seemed to be a test of how the new US   president would react. ” ’’ ’   Assad’’s father, the former president of Syria, ”mastered this way   of testing his enemies and doing just enough to keep enemies at   bay while retaining the options to continue to do bad things,”   Cook told Business Insider. ’ ’   ”That’’s clearly what Assad did with chemical weapons.” ’ ’   Cook explained that as the new administration in the US seemed to   signal a change in policy  —   on the campaign trail, Trump talked   about closing US borders to Syrian refugees  —   Assad might have   decided to see what he could get away with. ’ ’   ”For the life of me, I can’’t understand the strategic value of   using the chemical weapons in this town,” Cook said. ”It seemed   to be a way to see how the Trump administration is going to   respond.” ’ ’   It remains to be seen whether this strike against Assad’’s   military represents a major shift in US policy toward Syria.   Secretary of State Rex Tillerson said Thursday that he ”would not   in any way attempt to extrapolate that to a change in our policy   or posture relative to our military activities in Syria today.” ’ ’   Fred Hof, the director of the Atlantic Council’’s Rafik Hariri   Center for the Middle East and former US special adviser on   Syria, told Business Insider that the strike would ”either be a          retaliation for a heinous   chemical weapons assault on civilians, or it will serve as a   signal to the Assad regime and its allies that the free ride for   mass murder in Syria is now over.” ’ ”   Assad’s atrocities against civilians aren’t new. He has for years   used everything but nerve gas  —   including chemical weapons like   chlorine  —   to bomb schools, marketplaces, and hospitals. The   attacks have been   but have not inspired   international action. ” ’   ”Assad struck with chemicals because his sense of impunity had   over years of Western apathy and inaction become absolute,” Hof   said. ’ ’   The Obama administration never directly struck the Assad regime. ’ ’   President Barack Obama in 2012 drew a ”red line,” threatening   military action if the Assad regime used chemical weapons. Once   evidence surfaced of such an attack in 2013, Obama backed off his   threat of military force and instead opted to cut a deal in which   Assad agreed to remove his stockpile of chemical weapons,   including the nerve agent his forces are thought to have used   this week. ’ ’   Some experts have argued that this inaction from the US had   emboldened the Assad regime. ’ ’   With the latest attack, ”perhaps [Assad] wished to demonstrate to   his opponents that further resistance was useless, that the world   would do nothing in response,” Hof said. ”Clearly, he   miscalculated.” ’ ’   Still, if Assad continues his attacks on civilians using other   weapons and the US does nothing, the US strike ”will go down in   history as a useless, empty gesture,” Hof said. ’ ”   It’s likely that the Trump administration will be tested again in   the future. ” ’   After the US strike, the Syrian army accused the US of ”blatant   aggression” and said it would respond by continuing to ”crush   terrorism.” The Assad regime considers any opposition forces,   including the rebels who are trying to remove him from power, to   be terrorists. The regime also has not distinguished civilians   from combatants in the past. ’ ’   ”If the strikes of April 6, 2017, end the Assad crime wave   against Syrian civilians, good,” Hof said. ”If they do not,   further action will be essential.” ’ ”The timing of Syrian President Bashar Assad’s. ..” ’’ ’’ ’’
