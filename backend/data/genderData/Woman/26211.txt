Senate Minority Leader Harry Reid ( ) said Wednesday that he’s considering backing Republican presidential candidate Donald Trump. [“Look, we’ve gotten along fine,” Reid said. “With that bunch of people running, I’m kind of pulling for him. ”  According to The Hill, Reid then tried to walk back his comments. Asked about Trump’s statement, Reid added, ‘Oh, I remember the good old days when he did a fundraiser or two for me.’ Reid quickly walked back his comments, apologizing for joking about supporting Trump  —   whom he called a ‘hateful demagogue who will do immeasurable damage to our country.’ ‘There’s some things I shouldn’t joke about,’ he said from the Senate floor. ‘The danger of a Donald Trump candidacy to our country is not a joke.’ On Tuesday Donald Trump appeared on MSNBC’s Morning Joe and spoke of his good relationship with Reid. From the Washington Times: ‘I’ve always had a good relationship with Nancy Pelosi. I’ve never had a problem,’ Mr. Trump said on MSNBC’s “Morning Joe. ” ‘[Harry] Reid’s going to be gone. I always had a decent relationship with Reid, although lately obviously I haven’t been dealing with him, so he’ll use my name as the ultimate   …     of the billionaires in terms of people you don’t want.’ ‘But I think I’d be able to get along very well with Nancy Pelosi and just about everybody,’ he said. ‘Hey look, I think I’ll be able to get along well with Schumer, Chuck Schumer. I was always very good with Schumer. I was close to Schumer in many ways.’
