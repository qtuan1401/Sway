(Want to get this briefing by email? Here’s the  .) Good evening. Here’s the latest. 1. Georgetown University is taking what historians say are unprecedented steps to atone for past slaveholding. The university will make a formal apology, give descendants of the enslaved preferential admissions status, rename buildings, create an institute for the study of slavery and erect a public memorial. _____ 2. Both backers and critics sorted through Donald Trump’s latest declarations on immigration, which included calls to end   sanctuary cities and “zero tolerance for criminal aliens. ” He kept plans for an “impenetrable, physical, tall, powerful, beautiful” wall at the border with Mexico. “He used us as props,” said one of Mr. Trump’s disillusioned conservative Hispanic supporters. Meanwhile, Mr. Trump’s team is laying careful groundwork for his visit to a black church in Detroit on Saturday. A document our reporters obtained includes 12 questions the pastor intends to ask him for a cable show  —   about police killings, racial tension and the perception among many black voters that he and the Republican Party are racist  —   along with the answers Mr. Trump’s aides have prepared. _____ 3. Hillary Clinton logged her most successful month of   bringing in $143 million in August. Most was for Democratic organizations rather than her own campaign, but the party can use the money to organize and mobilize voters. _____ 4. A SpaceX rocket exploded on a Florida launchpad while being fueled, destroying a communications satellite that Facebook had planned to use to expand internet service in Africa. SpaceX’s head, Elon Musk, said the cause had yet to be determined. The blast could delay NASA’s plans to use the same rocket, a Falcon 9, to carry astronauts and cargo to the International Space Station. _____ 5. Tens of thousands of protesters took over a major highway and several avenues and plazas in Caracas, the Venezuelan capital, demanding a referendum to recall President Nicolás Maduro. They railed against spiraling violence, a lack of jobs and widespread food shortages. “Sometimes I want to kill myself,” said a    mother. _____ 6. Chicago’s bloody summer has gotten worse. As of midnight Wednesday, the city had racked up 90 murders in August, its deadliest month in about 20 years. At a street protest, a priest pleaded for the governor to ask for federal intervention. “We’re tired of the blood,” he and other protesters called out. “We’re tired of the tears. We need peace. We need help. State of emergency!” _____ 7. Who really controls Anbang? The Chinese insurer has made a wave of   deals around the world, including buying the Waldorf Astoria in Manhattan, above. Listed shareholders include   merchants and villagers  —   some of them relatives and friends of its politically connected chairman. The confusion over who really pulls the strings makes it difficult for regulators to assess the riskiness of the deals. _____ 8. A South Carolina county’s campaign against the Zika virus went badly awry. A government employee failed to forewarn a commercial beekeeper of aerial spraying aimed at mosquitoes, and millions of honeybees were killed. A bee expert said the episode could have wider repercussions. “If you’re killing honeybees, you’re killing a lot of other   pollinators, too,” he said, “and those populations could take a long time to recover. ” _____ 9. The Paralympic Games, which begin next week, already have a star: Tatyana McFadden, 27, above right. Paralyzed from the waist down by spina bifida and adopted from a Russian orphanage, she could become the first athlete to sweep every distance in wheelchair racing, from the 100 meters to the marathon. A sister, above left, is racing in three of the same events. “We’re on the cusp of breaking the barriers for Paralympic sport,” Ms. McFadden said. _____ 10. Kanye West isn’t just one of the world’s most popular rappers. He’s also the creator of this sculpture, featuring 12 animatronic   icons snoozing together, including himself his wife, Kim Kardashian West Rihanna George W. Bush Taylor Swift Anna Wintour Donald Trump Bill Cosby and Caitlyn Jenner. The work, made by Mr. West’s art collective for his “Famous” video, is now on sale from a Los Angeles gallery. Price tag: $4 million. Above, Ms. Kardashian West admiring her silicone husband. _____ 11. Finally, we bring you “The Kittens’ Wedding,” an elaborate tableau completed in the 1890s by the Victorian taxidermist Walter Potter. “It’s such a perfect object, with a tension between the perverse and the adorable,” said the   of the Brooklyn museum, Morbid Anatomy, that is showing the work. _____ Your Evening Briefing is posted at 6 p. m.
