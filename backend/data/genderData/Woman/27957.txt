While Donald Trump was winning the day nationally on November 8, voters in Kansas and Indiana were enshrining that hunting and fishing are constitutional rights. [The Wichita Eagle reports that an overwhelming majority of voters supported amending the Kansas constitution to include a right to hunt and fish. The push to do so arose after lawmakers watched   activists in other states use lawsuits to diminish hunting or do away with certain hunts altogether.  State Representative Adam Lusker ( ) pushed the amendment, which he described as a “  move. ” He “pointed to a recent lawsuit filed by a   animal rights group to stop a western Kansas coyote hunting contest as proof that hunting needs as much protection as possible. ” Kansas’ right to hunt and fish amendment protects the right to trap, too. Indiana voters protected hunting and fishing as well. The Ball State Daily reported, “Indiana has voted, and the Indiana Right to Hunt and Fish Amendment will now be added to the Indiana Bill of Rights. ” As in Kansas, the Indiana Right to Hunt and Fish Amendment passed by an overwhelming margin —  roughly 4 to 1. The passage of Indiana’s amendment means “public hunting and fishing are now the preferred method of wildlife management [in the state]. ” AWR Hawkins is the Second Amendment columnist for Breitbart News and host of “Bullets with AWR Hawkins,” a Breitbart News podcast.
