TALLAHASSEE, FL  —   Friday at a campaign appearance on the campus of the historically black university Florida AM, Democratic   nominee Sen. Tim Kaine ( ) attacked Republican presidential nominee Donald Trump on the grounds of race. [Before a mostly   student audience, Kaine tied Trump to “Ku Klux Klan values” and “David Duke values. ”  “Donald Trump was a main guy behind the scurrilous, and I would say bigoted notion that President Obama wasn’t even born in this country and Donald Trump has continued to push that irresponsible, falsehood from all the way up to now, and that’s the difference in this election and that’s the stakes,” Kaine said. “Yesterday, Hillary Clinton gave a speech in Reno, Nevada calling out Donald Trump on a lot of things on this equality idea. Calling him out on the fact that he has supporters like David Duke connected with the Ku Klux Klan, who are going around and saying Donald Trump is their candidate because Donald Trump is pushing their values. Ku Klux Klan values, David Duke values, Donald Trump values are not American values. ” “They’re not our values and we’ve got to do all we can to fight, to push back and win to say that we’re still about heading towards that North Star that we set out so long ago,” he continued. “So that gets down to the reason for this rally. The reason that we’re here at FAMU, you have a superb reputation of any university of student activism and of getting people to understand the critical importance of voting. So we’re starting actually a national movement with HBCU’s and other universities as colleges are coming back into session, to talk to students about registering and voting and we want FAMU to lead the way. Are you ready to do that?” Watch: Follow Jeff Poor on Twitter @jeff_poor
