GOP frontrunner Donald Trump tells a young audience at St. Norbert College in De Pere, Wisconsin about success. [“When you graduate, you want to get great jobs,” Trump told the audience. “If you want vacations, you’re not really in the right business. ”  The real estate mogul also told students that the unemployment rate is designed to make politicians and presidents look good, but that it doesn’t account for people who have stopped looking for jobs. “The loving is more important than having that good business,” Trump told the young listeners. “People that have great relationships with their wives or husbands” have great happiness, he explained. “Some of the most successful people in the world  …    they’re not necessarily happy people. ” “Most people think success is measured in the form of monetary success. It’s not really,” he added, saying that be believes a successful person is one that has a loving family. However, he did acknowledge monetary success “does make life easier. ” “Never give up,” he told them. “You have to know about momentum. ” “The word momentum is a very important word  …    it’s a word you never hear when you think about success,” he explained, adding that it’s “important. ” Trump told the young listeners to slow down and focus on something else if they ever feel that they have lost momentum. “There’s a certain amount of luck,” he acknowledged. “The harder you work, the luckier you get. ” He told the crowd to remember to have “momentum, [and to] love what you do. ” Trump spoke only a little about politics, taking swipes at rival GOP presidential candidate Sen. Ted Cruz ( ) and those that he has defeated such as former Florida Gov. Jeb Bush and Wisconsin Gov. Scott Walker.
