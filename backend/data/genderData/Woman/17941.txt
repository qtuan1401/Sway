On this weekend’s broadcast of “Fox News Sunday,” Republican   nominee Gov. Mike Pence ( ) said while his running mate Republican presidential nominee Donald Trump is under heavy media scrutiny, the media is ignoring “an avalanche of hard evidence about corruption, pay to play, political favoritism emanating out of Hillary Clinton’s years as secretary of state. ”  Pence said, “The American people are very, very troubled. once again, here we are in an election of such enormous magnitude in the life of this nation, and once again, the media is piling on with unsubstantiated claims as the headlines while they ignore an avalanche of hard evidence about corruption, pay to play, political favoritism emanating out of Hillary Clinton’s years as secretary of state. We found out this week, that while she was secretary of state, her officials in that department actually directed reconstruction contracts in Haiti to friends of the Clinton. this is precisely the kind of pay to play politics she said wasn’t happening as their foundation accepted tens of millions of dollars from foreign governments. ” “Just this morning The New York Times is reporting that in exchange for a   meeting, the government of Qatar pledged $1 million to the Clinton Foundation. The American people are tired of all of this, and frankly, they’re very tired, present company excepted, they’re tired of the media going after unsubstantiated allegations that Donald Trump has categorically denied while they willfully ignore an avalanche of hard evidence about Clinton’s scandals,” he added.
