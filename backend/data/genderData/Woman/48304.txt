’  ’ ’   Sean Hannity on Tuesday laced into Glenn Beck, Texas Sen. Ted   Cruz, and the   Never Trump movement at large, saying on   his radio program that he will hold those who refused to back   Donald Trump responsible should Hillary Clinton win the White   House in November. ’ ’   ”You own Hillary Clinton. National Review, you own it. Glenn   Beck, you own it. Ted Cruz, you own it. . .. She wins, I’’m blaming   all of you,” Hannity said. ”[Y]ou own all of her policies.” ’ ’   He added: ”Yeah, I’’m going to name names. I’’m not sitting here   and wimping out. I know there are people out there blaming me.” ’ ’   The conservative radio host first named Ohio Gov. John Kasich,   former Florida Gov. Jeb Bush, and Cruz. He then went after   members of the conservative media, particularly seeming to home   in on Beck, whom he characterized as on a ”holy war” against   Trump. ’ ’’ ’   Hannity concluded the segment by saying that, ”on the flip side,”   if Trump were to win the White House and not keep his promises,   then he would accept responsibility. ’ ’   ”I’’ll take the blame and responsibility,” he said. ”OK? Gladly. I   will proudly pull the lever for Trump.” ’ ’   Hannity has railed against the Never Trump movement before, but   he has almost always refrained from naming specific people,   particularly Beck. ’ ’   Beck, through a representative, declined to comment. ’ ’   The tirade was likely to deepen an     rift inside the conservative news media. Hannity, Matt Drudge,   Ann Coulter, and the website Breitbart have  with Beck and more traditional   conservative news outlets over their support for Trump in this   election cycle. ’
