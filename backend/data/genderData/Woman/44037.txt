”   Fox News host Shepard Smith said on Friday afternoon that the   network’s news division was unable to confirm a report from an   analyst who said earlier this week President Barack Obama sought   help from British intelligence to spy on   Donald   Trump. ” ’   ”Fox News cannot confirm Judge [Andrew] Napolitano’’s commentary,”   Smith said. ”Fox News knows of no evidence of any kind that the     of the United States was surveilled at any time, in   any way. Full stop.” ’ ’ ’ ’Video of Fox News saying it has ”no evidence” of Trump’’s claim   > ’ ’   Napolitano, appearing on ”Fox & Friends” Tuesday, said ”three   intelligence sources have informed Fox News that President Obama   went outside the chain of command” and requested the UK’’s   Government Communication Headquarters track Trump. ’ ’   ”They have   access to the NSA database,” Napolitano said on   Tuesday. ”So by simply having two people go to them saying,   ‘President Obama needs transcripts of conversations involving   candidate Trump, conversations involving   Trump,’   he’s able to get it, and there’s no American fingerprints on   this. ” ’ ”   Under pressure, Fox News responded through Smith’s commentary. A   spokesperson said the matter would also be addressed on shows   later in the evening.  ” ’ ’ ’ ’t’t’t.: Three intel sources have disclosed that Pres. Obama turned to British spies to get surveillance on Trump  ’ ’   Citing flimsy reports from   sources, Trump claimed   earlier this month that Obama wiretapped him, a claim that has   been flatly rejected by officials throughout the US government. ’ ’   The leaders of the Senate Intelligence Committee  that they saw no indication   Trump Tower was subject of surveillance ”by any element of the   United States government before or after Election Day 2016.” ’ ’   Trump, who still has no evidence to support his sensational   claim, has yet to issue an apology or retraction. ’ ’Fox News host Shepard Smith said on Friday. ..’ ’’ ’’ ’’
