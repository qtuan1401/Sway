Colleges around the country are facing an epidemic an epidemic of Trump supporters, who are causing panic among the regressive left by scrawling chalk messages in support of Donald Trump around campuses. [The trend began at Atlanta’s Emory University on March 21st, where a message entitled “TRUMP 2016” appeared in chalk on a campus sidewalk. Student immediately began protesting, telling campus officials that the   messages made them feel “afraid” and “in pain. ”  Similar incidents occured at the University of Kansas, where “TRUMP 2016” and “VOTE TRUMP 2016” chalk messages also appeared.

Chalk messages included “Trump build the wall 2016,” “Obama is a Muslim,” “Muhammed f***ed children” and “the wall just got 10 feet higher. ” There have also been reports of   chalk messages at Louisiana State University, the University of Maryland, Kansus University, Central Michigan University, Texas AM, Texas State, Mississippi State University, Arizona State University, Florida State University, Oklahoma State University, the University of Houston, The University of Alabama at Birmingham, and the University of Arkansas, Fort Smith. The chalk messages have caused outraged reactions from some students. Alejandra Melgozer, a Chicano studies and social science major at UCSB, told the college paper that she feared the   messages would scare off future students: “It concerns me to have families and potential incoming students not want to enrol into our beautiful campus due to hateful speech they may see while they walk around our lovely campus. ” At the University of Michigan, students were so triggered by the   messages that they called the police.   chalk messages on campus were also denounced by the UoM administration, and are being investigated by an   advocacy group, who called them “hate graffiti. ” At Scripps College, a   message that appeared on a college whiteboard was condemned as “racist” and “violent” by the student body president.

Wagner instead chose to come down on the side of free speech. Surrounded by students from the Emory chapter of Young Americans for Liberty (YAL) Wagner chalked a message stating “Emory stands for free expression. ” Nevertheless, the Emory administration also issued an official statement condemning the   messages as representing “values regarding diversity and respect that clash with Emory’s own. ” Dan Scavino, Director of Social Media for the Trump campaign, has been using Twitter to encourage the   chalk messages on Campus. Scavino said he would pass on the “best”   chalk messages to the candidate himself.
