’  ’ ’   A   law group on Wednesday filed a   lawsuit against the Department of Justice, alleging the federal   agency violated the law by ignoring Freedom of Information Act   requests for records related to Attorney General Loretta   Lynch’s tarmac meeting with former President Bill Clinton. ’ ’   “We’re forcing their hand,” Jay Sekulow, chief counsel of the   American Center for Law and Justice,  announcing the   lawsuit. ’ ’   Sekulow added: “We’re taking the Obama Administration to federal   court. Again. We’re filing a lawsuit against the Department of   Justice, to ensure true justice. ” ’ ’   The ACLJ initially sent FOIA requests to the DOJ requesting   information on Lynch’s meeting with Clinton. ’ ’   The records requested included documents “containing any   discussion of or in any way regarding the meeting between” the   two at the Phoenix airport and electronic communications   “containing any discussion of or in any way naming, regarding,   involving or referring Clinton. ” ’ ’’ ’   The DOJ “wholly failed to respond” to the FOIA requests, the ACLJ   said in its complaint. The law firm accused the DOJ of violating   two statues requiring federal agencies to respond to public   records requests. ’ ’   “The bottom line of our lawsuit is this: the ‘Defendant is   unlawfully withholding records requested by Plaintiff pursuant to   5 U. S. C. § 552,’” Sekulow wrote. “The Justice Department’s answer   to our suit will be due in about 30 days. ” ’ ’   Critics of Hillary Clinton, including Republican presidential   nominee Donald Trump,  that Bill Clinton’s meeting on   the Arizona tarmac with Lynch was somehow related to getting   Hillary Clinton off the hook from the FBI’s email investigation   into her private server. ’ ”   The lawsuit came days after FBI Director James Comey   announced that it had  into Hillary   Clinton’s private email server, a move that was  with Lynch’s wishes.  ”
