The Daily Beast’s Eleanor Clift argued that Republican presidential candidate Texas Senator Ted Cruz “makes Donald Trump look like a raving liberal” and “most Democrats would look at the two of them, and would prefer Trump over Cruz” on Friday’s “McLaughlin Group. ”  Clift said, “We’ve paid so little attention to what Cruz actually stands for, and when  —   the attention I’ve paid is  —   I get pretty scared, actually. He makes Donald Trump look like a raving liberal, actually. ” When asked who should we would vote for between the two candidates if she had to pick, Clift responded that she made herself clear, and didn’t have to, or want to repeat her preference. ” After host John McLaughlin asked “You’d vote for Trump?” Clift answered, “I think most Democrats would look at the two of them, and would prefer Trump over Cruz, yes. ” She was then asked whether she would be comfortable with a Trump presidency, to which she stated that she wouldn’t, and “I look at his foreign policy and I think it’s pretty scary. ” Follow Ian Hanchett on Twitter @IanHanchett
