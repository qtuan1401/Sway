Thursday in Waterloo, IA, while campaigning for his wife Democratic presidential nominee Hillary Clinton, former President Bill Clinton told a protestor shouting, “You’re a rapist” that his “problem” was his choice in media outlets.  Clinton said, “Give that guy a hand. They’ve had a very bad week in the Trump campaign. He feels bad. Give him a hand. Give him a hand. The problem is if you only listen to one television station and nobody ever tells you the truth, you get like that. ” He added, “That’s what’s wrong with American politics. I don’t want you to treat them the way they treat you. ” Follow Pam Key on Twitter @pamkeyNEN
