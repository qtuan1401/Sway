New poll: Trump, Clinton tied before debate. .. @JoeNBC: The race is up in the air https:  .  Monday on MSNBC’s “Morning Joe,” after revealing polling data showing Republican presidential nominee tied with his Democratic counterpart Hillary Clinton in a number of national and battleground state polls, host Joe Scarborough explained why he viewed this election as unprecedented and said Trump supporters now have “every reason to believe” Trump could emerge victorious in November.  “I mean, we’ve seen things going back and forth, but nothing like this election before,” Scarborough said. “Absolutely nothing and Mark Halperin, if you had to create a script of a ‘Bonfire of the Vanities’ election and you wanted to have it move in a certain dramatic way going up to the first debate, this is exactly how you would do it. The numbers here are surprising enough. The state polls that we saw on Friday and that we see this morning are just stunning. The race is up in the air and Donald Trump’s supporters have every reason to believe he’s going to win this election. ” Follow Jeff Poor on Twitter @jeff_poor
