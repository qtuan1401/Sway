Conservative radio host Hugh Hewitt suggests the Republican Party should change the rules ahead of the GOP National Convention so presumptive Republican nominee Donald Trump can be replaced. [“It’s like ignoring   cancer. You can’t do it, you gotta go attack it,” Hewitt says. “And right now the Republican Party is facing  —   the plane is headed towards the mountain after the last 72 hours. ”  “I wanna support the nominee of the party, but I think the party ought to change the nominee. Because we’re going to get killed with this nominee,” he added. “I have never said that!” Hewitt exclaimed, claiming that he’s been neutral during the GOP primary election. “I waited until after the primary was over, I stayed Switzerland to the end, and in 72 hours, dovetailed to that. ” “They ought to get together and let the convention decide,” Hewitt stressed. “And if Donald Trump pulls over a makeover in the next 4 to 5 weeks, great, they can keep him. It would be better if he had done so 5 weeks ago. ” He added that if the rules don’t change so that the GOP can dump Trump, there needs to be a “personality transplant in Trump Tower. ”
