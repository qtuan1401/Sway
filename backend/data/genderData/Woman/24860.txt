Democratic presidential nominee Hillary Clinton says she’ll visit the devastation caused by flooding in Louisiana, but refused to set a specific date. [“The best way to help Louisianans affected by these terrible floods is to make sure they have the resources they need today,” Clinton said in a statement released by her campaign. “I am committed to visiting communities affected by these floods, at a time when the presence of a political campaign will not disrupt the response, to discuss how we can and will rebuild. ”  President Barack Obama announced plans to visit the state on Tuesday after Republican presidential nominee Donald Trump led the way by visiting the state on Friday. Clinton added that she had already urged her supporters to donate money to the Red Cross to assist the victim. “We must make sure that all resources are brought to bear in responding to the crisis and helping communities rebuild,” she said. Since flooding began in Louisiana, Clinton has resisted making a trip to the area, focusing on a busy campaign schedule which includes 21 fundraisers in the last days of August in New York and California.
