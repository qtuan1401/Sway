Donald Trump closed a   polling gap with Hillary Clinton in five days, leaving them half a percent apart during the next   period, according to new polling data from Reuters. [On August 22, Clinton led Trump by 12 points, 44. 8 percent to 32. 8 percent. By Aug. 27, the two candidates were neck and neck, according to Reuters.   By Aug. 29, Trump had nudged up again to 39. 1 percent, while she was at 39. 7 percent. He gained 6. 7 points, while she lost 5. 1 points during the entire   period.  Twenty percent of the respondents declined to pick either of the two leaders in the poll of 1, 397 likely voters, which was concluded Aug . 29.  Trump’s support among Republicans climbed from 71 percent up to 78. 3 percent. Clinton’s support among Democrats dipped slightly from 81. 6 percent to 78. 5 percent.  The poll reflects a general trend, in which Trump has managed to close much of the gap that Clinton opened in early August.  In July, Reuters sharply changed how it presented polling data, political strategist Pat Caddell told Breitbart Radio. “It is, beyond doubt, the most outrageous thing,” he declared. Caddell cited two examples to Breitbart News. “On July 25, they originally reported: Trump 40. 3 percent and Clinton 37. 2 percent, which was a Trump margin of 2. 8,” he said. “They have recalculated that now —  which I have never heard of —  they changed that data, to be: Clinton 40. 9 and Trump 38. 4, which is a 2. 5 margin for Clinton. ” The July 25 Reuters poll now shows a result that reflects a 5. 3 percentage point flip from the previously published results, he said. “Now look at July 26,” he said. “On July 26 they had Trump at 41. 5 percent and Hillary at 36. 3. That was a 5. 2 Trump margin. Then, in the new calculation, they claim that Clinton was 41. 1 percent, Trump was 37. 5, and the margin was 3. 6 for Clinton. Same poll. Two different results. Recalculated, after you’ve announced the other results. ” “What you get is an 8. 8 percentage point margin change, almost nine points swinging from one candidate, based on some phony, some bizarre allocation theory that you claim you know where these people are or you are just leaving them out,” he said. “I actually believe they are allocating them because they are claiming they are really Clinton voters and they are using something to move them to Clinton. ” “This comes as close as I have ever seen to cooking the results,” said the legendary pollster and political consultant. “I suppose you can get away with it in polling because there are no laws. But, if this was accounting, they would put them in jail. ”
