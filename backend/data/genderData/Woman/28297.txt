Billionaire candidate Donald Trump says Hillary Clinton should be indicted for her mishandling of classified documents  —   after a Fox News report showed that she was sharing documents on her insecure server that was classified higher than top secret. [“What she did is so ridiculous, it’s so, frankly stupid   …     she was conniving, you know it’s just the way she is,” he said during an interview with radio host Howie Carr.  Trump suggested that Clinton was being protected by the Obama administration, as she was running to succeed him in 2016. “Right now President Obama and the whole group, they’re probably protecting her, and we’re going to find out how our law works,” he said, calling it a “criminal act. ” He said that he spoke to several lawyers and experts who agreed that Clinton absolutely should be indicted. He also mocked Hillary Clinton for failing to share secrets without people finding out about it. “With that kind of ineptitude you can’t be President of the United States,” he said. Earlier today, Trump suggested that Vice President Joe Biden might enter the race  —   if Clinton was indicted. “If she  —   for instance, gets indicted  —   if she has to go on trial, they’re going to have Biden or somebody else come in,” he said in an interview with radio host Simon Conway this morning. “We’ll see what happens. I wouldn’t mind that either. ”
