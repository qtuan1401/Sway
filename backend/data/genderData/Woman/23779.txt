Tonight in his speech at University of South Florida, MILO dropped a number of killer Clinton roasts. Here are a few of the best.[  “Imagine the poor liberal feminists who think Hillary will represent them in office. They’d show up for a rape symposium at the White House and find topics like “No one will believe that slut, right?” and “Managing bimbo eruptions. ” When asked “When will we find out what Chelsea Clinton thinks of her dad?” MILO replied with: “Well I don’t know think we know who her dad is. ” “Late breaking news from the FBI, by the way. Hillary’s special podium has been given immunity. No word what it will testify about yet.  Not a replacement for Obamacare, just a massive bureaucracy designed to administer her own personal health needs. ” “It’s no mystery why Hillary is so fond of putting women in burkas, given Bill’s wandering eyes and hands. ” “There’s no safe space for those who embarrass the Clintons! Except perhaps the witness protection program. Or an urn. ” “The good news is, the debate rules favor Trump. Hillary has to stand for the whole thing! No phoning a friend. Does anyone know the dialling code for Hell?”  “Assange promises an October Surprise, and I assume that doesn’t mean Hillary losing control of her bowels during a speech. ” “A handy tip for Hillary  …     if you start giving speeches to groups of midgets, when the press describes a “small crowd” you can just call them bigots. ” “That’s right, even I, a fag from Britain just stopping by the States to remind y’all not to be crazy this November  —   I attract crowds five times the size of Hillary’s. ” “I think Americans are smart enough not to vote for a   White House, and that’s before we even get onto the subject of the Supreme Court. ”
