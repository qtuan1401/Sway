Breitbart senior editor MILO pointed out the fact that it’s now Breitbart News who are publishing “interesting and provocative” and not the   media, before arguing that free speech is now a conservative position during HBO’s Real Time with Bill Maher on Friday.[  After joking why he doesn’t hire gays (“they don’t show up on time, they do too many drugs”) MILO argued with Maher as to whether he was actually a “conservative. ” “Well I don’t know if I’m a conservative,” proclaimed MILO, after Maher branded him as such. “You write for Breitbart and you’re a Trump supporter,” Maher replied. “You’re a conservative. ” “Well it’s interesting the radical gay editorials saying interesting and provocative things about gays are now being published by Breitbart, and I don’t think really that you can call Trump a traditional conservative,” responded MILO. “He’s not that Republican. ” “All I care about is free speech and free expression. I want people to be able to be, do, and say anything,” he concluded, before adding, “These days, you’re right, that’s a conservative position. ” Watch MILO’s full appearance on Real Time With Bill Maher at this link.
