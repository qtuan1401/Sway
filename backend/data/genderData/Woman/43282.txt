Michael Flynn. ” ’’ ’   ”The NSC will miss the opportunity to have Monica Crowley as part   of our team,” Flynn said in a statement. ”We wish her all the   best in her future.” ’ ”   An investigation by CNN’s KFile published earlier this month   revealed more than 50 places in Crowley’s 2012 New York Times     that appear to have been lifted verbatim from a   variety of columnists, think tanks, and Wikipedia. ” ’   Crowley’’s history of plagiarism accusations dates back several   years, . The publication points to an editorial   feature Crowley wrote for The Wall Street Journal in 1999 that   was found to have ”striking similarities in phraseology” to a   1988 article by Paul Johnson in Commentary magazine, The Journal   said in an editorial note. ’ ’ Chris Sanchez contributed to this report. ’
