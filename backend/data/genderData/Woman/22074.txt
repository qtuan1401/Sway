Republican presidential candidates Sen. Marco Rubio ( ) and Sen. Ted Cruz ( ) are still going after each other in South Carolina, with Cruz’s campaign saying that Rubio has: “been reduced to spreading false Internet rumors. ”[The latest fight is over a fake Facebook page that claimed Rep. Trey Gowdy was supporting Cruz instead of Rubio.  According to TIME: There was no evidence that the Cruz campaign was behind the posting, but that didn’t stop Rubio from laying the blame on his Senate colleague and the type of campaign he is running. “It’s part of a pattern,” Rubio said. “They didn’t say they were supporting Donald Trump. They didn’t say they were supporting Ben Carson. So it’s just a pattern of people around his campaign that have continuously done things like that. ” Cruz’s campaign has argued that Rubio has misconstrued his record to South Carolina voters, accusing him of still supporting “amnesty” and skipping votes on defense spending and defunding Planned Parenthood. “Rubio’s campaign has been reduced to spreading false Internet rumors,” said Cruz spokesman Brian Phillips. “It’s a sad development. But I suppose they’d rather lie about fake Facebook pages than own up to his support for amnesty, missing the fight on Planned Parenthood funding, and surrendering to the courts on marriage. ”
