MILWAUKEE  —   Mets Manager Terry Collins felt ill about an hour before Sunday’s game in Milwaukee and was taken to a nearby hospital for tests, the Mets assistant general manager John Ricco said. The bench coach Dick Scott, who last managed with Class A South Bend in 1997, took over for Collins. Ricco offered no specifics about what was wrong with Collins but promised to update reporters later in the day. Collins, 66, seemed fine speaking to reporters in his office about two and a half hours before the game at Miller Park. He reviewed the limited options off his bench: Second baseman Neil Walker (stiff back) and outfielder Michael Conforto (sore wrist) weren’t available, and Collins hoped to give shortstop Asdrubal Cabrera his first complete day off this season. “Managing in the minor leagues, you’re used to it because it happens all the time,” he said. “In ‘84 I had to activate myself to give us enough players to play. If you’ve done it as long as I’ve been doing it, it’s just part of the game. ”
