He says he baited Trump by saying he had a   seat and never intended to be the center of attention. Interesting spin. There are a lot of Trump supporters —  many of whom support the Mavericks —  in Texas and many Trump supporters who watch ”Shark Tank. ” Could he have received some backlash? 11:30: It’s up to him to be a skilled candidate and pivot to these issues. Did he think Holt would be neutral after the reaction Matt Lauer got after the    forum? Nothing on emails. Nothing on the corrupt Clinton Foundation. And nothing on #Benghazi. #Debates2016 #debatenight,  —   Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) September 27, 2016,  Trump is often good at forcing media to discuss his issues, which makes the times he doesn’t do it all the more puzzling.  —   John Hayward (@Doc_0) September 27, 2016,    Why he should not be in the spin room: VIDEO: Donald Trump tells me he thought Lester Holt did a great job, questions were fair &gt&gt&gt pic. twitter.   —   Dylan Byers (@DylanByers) September 27, 2016,      11:20: Clinton has left the building.

Trump says he thinks the debate went “better” than he thought. 10:58: John Hayward  : Trump had golden opportunity to potentially win the election tonight. He could not capitalize.     political inertia will favor Clinton. Trump needed a knockout he didn’t get to reverse that inertia.

Trump says he wants to make America Great Again and if Clinton wins, he will “absolutely support her. ” Love Lester, but how is Trump questioned about his baggage (tax returns, birther, etc) but Clinton gets nothing about emails, Libya, etc?  —   Bill Melugin (@BillFOX46) September 27, 2016,  10:32: Trump says we “cannot be the policemen of the world” and defend countries all over the world. Trump says Clinton doesn’t have the stamina to be president of this country. He says you also have to be able to negotiate good trade deals. After Clinton says Trump can talk to her about stamina after he travels to 128 countries, Trump says Clinton’s experience is “bad experience” and the country can’t afford four more years of “bad experience. ” After Holt sets up Clinton by asking Trump about his comments about looks, Clinton now accuses Trump of calling a woman in beauty contest “Miss Piggy” and “Miss Housekeeper” because she was Latina. Clinton says that Latina is an American citizen who will be voting against Trump. [Clinton gets her soundbite for Hispanic media in.] 10:30: Clinton now speaking about standing up to bullies “abroad and at home. ” 10:29: WTF? Notice Trump sniffing all the time.

OK” for weeks, and damn it I’m going to use it.  —   Jonathan Bernstein (@jbview) September 27, 2016,  10:21: A potentially record audience is watching this debate, and Trump has FAILED to put Clinton on the defensive re: Clinton Foundation and how her use of a private email server endangered America’s national security. 10:19: Trump says “that is a mainstream media nonsense” when Holt says he supported the Iraq War.

He talks about the the hackers could be people weighing 400 lbs. sitting their bedrooms. [Lack of preparation and poor  .] 10:09: Trump says he was endorsed by admirals and ICE. He says the Border Patrol agents endorsed him as well. He says he will take the admirals and the generals over the political hacks. Trump says ISIS is beating us at our own game while Clinton is talking about how we can do more with tech companies to prevent ISIS from making gains. [Trump should have pointed out that Clinton’s use of a private email server endangered the country’s national security.] 10:06: Lester Holt asks Clinton about cybersecurity WITHOUT mentioning that Clinton’s use of a private server put our country’s national security at risk. Clinton says Putin is playing a “long game” by hacking into the personal files of government officials. She says she was “so shocked when” Trump asked Putin to “hack into Americans. ” 10:05:   point: Every @LesterHoltNBC question is a setup for @HillaryClinton to attack @realDonaldTrump. Exactly as the left  media demanded. #debatenight,  —   Joel B. Pollak (@joelpollak) September 27, 2016,  10:04: Trump says Clinton treated Obama with terrible “disrespect” during the debates.

Clinton accuse Trump of “starting his political activity” based on this “racist lie that our first Black President was not an American citizen. ” Clinton brings up that the Justice Department sued Trump twice for discriminating against prospective tenants. She says the “birther lie” was a “hurtful one” because Obama is a man of dignity. She says it bothered Obama and quotes Michelle Obama, who said, “when they go low, we go high. And Barack Obama went high despite Donald Trump’s best efforts to bring him down. ” 10:01: Trump says he thinks he has developed very good relations with the “  community” and he says he thinks he has done a great   for the   the president to get him to release his birth certificate. 9:59: Holt brings up the birther controversy. Trump says Clinton confidante Sidney Blumenthal and former campaign manager Patty Solis Doyle failed to get Obama’s birth certificate. He says he succeeded in getting the birth certificate and he wants to get on with fighting ISIS and securing the border. Holt says the birth certificate was presented in 2012 and he continued to express doubts. Trump is blaming Clinton’s allies for starting the controversy. 9:58: Trump says the   community has been let down by politicians who “abuse and use” them to get votes. Trump says he’s been all over while, looking at Clinton, “you decided to stay home. And that’s okay. ” Clinton says she thinks Trump criticized her for preparing for this debate. She says she also has prepared to be president, and that’s a good thing. 9:57: Trump’s Twitter ad: What is Hillary’s Worst Lie? Vote Now! https:  .   —   Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) September 27, 2016,  9:56: Hillary Clinton just said ”everyone” (yes, EVERYONE) is biased against black people. Wow. Called the whole country racist. #debatenight,  —   Raheem Kassam (@RaheemKassam) September 27, 2016,  9:55: Trump says we have to “look strongly” at   lists and watch lists re: gun control. He doesn’t mention that Americans can easily lose their Second Amendment rights due to bureaucratic errors. [Again, another example of Trump not being able to finesse a complex issue. Shows lack of preparation re: basic questions.] Trump defends stop and frisk after slamming Clinton for calling black criminals “super predators. ” 9:54: When asked about implicit biases against black people, Clinton says implicit bias is a problem not just for police but for everyone. She says everyone needs to ask hard questions about “why am I feeling this way?” 9:47: Clinton now pushing gun control. She says police are often outgunned by people with “militaristic” weapons. 9:45: Trump says we need “law and order” or we’re not going to have a country.  He says “we have a situation” where   and Hispanics in our inner cities are “living in hell” because “it’s so dangerous. ” He mentions the thousands of shootings in Chicago and says “we have to stop the violence” and “bring back law and order” in a place like Chicago. Trump now talks about illegal immigrant gang members roaming the streets and says we have to be “very vigilant. ” He says our police are afraid to do anything right now and “we have to protect our inner cities” because “  communities are being decimated by crime. ” Holt says stop and frisk was ruled unconstitutional in New York because it was a form of racial profiling. Clinton points out that stop and frisk was found to be “unconstitutional. ” Clinton talking about mandatory minimums and ending the privatization of the prison system. Clinton says she believes strongly that “commonsense gun measures should assist us. ” [Trump should have better answers and pivots to these very predictable questions.] 9:43: Debate turns to race relations. Holt says “one of you will have to bridge” a bitter divide. Clinton says race determines where people live and what kind of education people get and how they are treated in the criminal justice system. Clinton says “we’ve got to do several things at the same time. ” She says we have to “restore trust between communities and police” and police are   to use force only when necessary. 9:41: Trump says “it’s all words and soundbites. ” Trump, now defending the bankruptcy filings, says he used certain laws four times. He says he has taken advantage of the laws of the nation and his obligation is to do well for himself, his family, his employees, his companies. 9:40: Clinton says she has met tons of small business folks who were stiffed by Trump. When Clinton says thousands of people were stiffed, Trump says “maybe they didn’t do a good job. ” Clinton says she is relieved that her late father never did business with Trump. Clinton says sometimes there is not a “direct transfer of skills from business to government. ” 9:36: Clinton says she made a “mistake” using a private email server. She says she is “not going to make any excuses. ” Trump says “that was more than a mistake. ” He accuses Clinton of “purposefully” setting up a private email server. Trump says “you don’t learn that much from tax returns” and says her use of a private email server was “disgraceful. ” Trump now claims he is severely “ . ” Trump now pivoting to infrastructure, saying our country’s infrastructure is like a “  country” while spending trillions of dollars in the Middle East. He blames “politicians like Secretary Clinton” for causing these problems. Trump says we don’t have the money to rebuild our country because politicians like Clinton have squandered the country’s money. Clinton accuses Trump of not paying income taxes and not contributing to the treasury. 9:33: Trump says he will release his tax returns against his lawyers’s wishes as soon as Clinton releases here 33, 000 deleted emails. Some cheers in the audience. Holt admonishes the audience. Clinton says you’ve seen another example of “bait and switch here. ” She says everyone running for president has released tax returns. “You gotta ask yourself —  why won’t he release his tax returns? she says. Clinton says maybe Trump is not as rich as he says he is. She says maybe Trump is not as charitable as he says he is. Clinton says maybe he doesn’t want the American people to know that he has paid nothing in federal taxes. She also suggests Trump may owe money to Wall Street and foreign entities. Clinton trying to provoke Trump. She says “it must be something important” or “terrible” that Trump is trying to hide. [Holt doesn’t bring up Clinton’s emails. Trump had to do that.] 9:32: Holt asks Trump about his tax returns. Trump says he doesn’t mind releasing his tax returns but he is under a “routine audit” and he will release his return once the audit is complete. 9:31: Trump says Yellin and the Fed are doing “political things. ” He says the Fed will raise interest rates and “very bad things will happen” and the Fed is “being more political than Secretary Clinton. ” 9:30: [To use a football analogy, not an offensive showdown here. This is like two teams getting to the   line and punting, which is what often happens in   first halves of Super Bowls.] 9:29: Clinton seems to be getting under Trump’s skin a bit by talking about the “Trump loophole” and “    economics. ” 9:24: When Clinton falsely claims she will also cut a lot of regulations, Trump shakes his head. [Good visual for Trump.] Trump says Clinton will raise $1. 3 trillion worth of taxes. Trump ridicules Clinton for having a plan to fight ISIS on her website and Clinton says “at least I have a plan. ” Trump says Clinton has been fighting ISIS for her entire adult life because she telegraphs her plans to the enemy. Clinton says she has a feeling that she will be blamed for everything that has gone wrong. Trump says “why not?” Clinton mocks Trump for saying “crazy things” and Trump says it’s not crazy to talk about his plans for repatriation. 9:23: Trump says Clinton will tax and regulate businesses out of existence. Trump says when he travels around the country, people like that he has proposed to cut unnecessary regulations. He says he is going to “cut taxes big league” and “you’re going to raise taxes big league. End of story. ” Clinton promotes the home page of her website as a     site. Trump asks voters to take a look at his home page as well. 9:21: Trump says Clinton was “totally in favor” of the TPP and only changed her position when Trump’s opposition to the trade deal was resonating. Clinton, sounding lawyerly says she was against it once the terms were negotiated. Clinton says, “Donald, I know you live in your own reality” but those are not the facts. “Secretary, you have no plan,” Trump says. Clinton says she has a book of plans and says you can pick one up at the airport. She says “we have a very robust set of plans. ” [Clinton sounding like the    student who always sits at the front of the class and brings the teacher an apple.] 9:19: When Clinton says her husband did a great job, Trump says he approved NAFTA, which is one of the worst deals ever. Trump’s first “excuse me” of the night when he corrects Clinton, who is on the defensive over trade deals.   @HillaryClinton Has Demonstrated Her Position On Trade Is Purely Political #Debates https:  .   —   Sean Spicer (@seanspicer) September 27, 2016,  9:17: Clinton accuses Trump of believing that the Chinese created the climate change hoax. Trump interrupts and says that’s not true. Trump seems to bring up Solyndra as an example of the Dems’s failed green energy policy. Trump says Clinton cannot do what she is proposing to do when the country is $20 trillion in debt. Trump says we have to give companies better incentives to grow at home. He says you only have to look at Ohio and Michigan to see where all of the factories have left. Trump asks Clinton why she has just been proposing solutions on trade now when she has been in this for 30 years. Trump says he can bring back jobs and she can’t. 9:13: Trump must be in this to win it. He does NOT take the bait that Clinton threw out about his father having loaned him $14 million and   the matter endlessly. 9:12: Trump says we don’t know what we’re doing re: devaluation. He says we have to renegotiate our trade deals. Trump asks why hasn’t Clinton made trade deals better? He says Secretary Clinton should have been opposed to these trade deals years ago. Trump says we owe $20 trillion and “we can’t do it any longer. ” [Clinton is vulnerable on this issue because of her support for the   Partnership agreement.] . @realDonaldTrump on calling @HillaryClinton ”Secretary Clinton”: ”Is that okay?  …    I want you to be very happy.” https:  .   —   ABC News Politics (@ABCPolitics) September 27, 2016,  9:11: Clinton accuses Trump of supporting “ ” economics. She says Trump was “very fortunate” in his life with “$14 million” borrowed from his father. She accuses Trump of believing that the more you help wealthy people, the better the country will be. [Clinton is baiting Trump with the $14 million figure. Will Trump bite?] 9:08: Trump says “our jobs are fleeing this country” and going to China and Mexico. He says they are using “our country as a piggybank” to rebuild China. He says while Mexico is the “eighth wonder of the world” by building so many factories, America is not building new factories. He says “Hillary and I” agree on child care though they may disagree on numbers. He says we have to stop jobs being “stolen from us” and companies like Carrier from leaving the United States. He says that under his plan, he will be “reducing taxes tremendously” for small and big business. “That will be a job creator like we haven’t seen since Ronald Reagan,” Trump says. He says we must renegotiate our trade deals and stop these companies from stealing our companies and jobs. [Very good opening from Trump.] 9:06: Clinton says today is her granddaughter’s second birthday and talks about “investing in you. ” She talks about jobs and infrastructure in addition to clean energy and small businesses. She says “we have to make the economy fairer” and talks about raising the minimum wage, pay equity, and profit sharing. She wants the “wealthy to pay their fair share” and more corporate taxes. 9:05: Holt says central to the “Achieving Prosperity” section of the debate is jobs. He is talking about income inequality and asks Clinton why she is the better candidate to create jobs. 9:03: Lester Holt kicks off the first presidential debate. Trump and Clinton walk on stage. They shake hands. “How are you Donald?” Clinton says.

Presidents don’t need to understand policy minutia. They need to listen to experts and then help sell the best expert solutions to the public. Trump sells better than anyone you have ever seen, even if you haven’t personally bought into him yet. You can’t deny his persuasion talents that have gotten him this far. In summary, I don’t understand the policy details and implications of most of either Trump’s or Clinton’s proposed ideas. Neither do you. But I do understand persuasion. I also understand when the government is planning to confiscate the majority of my assets.

Obamaworld laughed as it watched Donald Trump’s hostile takeover of the GOP. After eight years of Republican opposition, inconsistent policy demands and racialized hate against the first black president, President Barack Obama’s aides, past and present, thought Republicans had gotten what they deserved —  and more, all but forfeiting the 2016 race to the woman they defeated eight years ago. They’re not laughing anymore. According to the Politico story, Obama’s current and former aides now conceded that “they’re going to have to live with the fact that Trump could end up in the Oval Office in part due to a backlash against Obama. ” 9:07: The mainstream media are attempting their best   spin about how much Trump lies in order to help Clinton. They conveniently ignore the fact that Clinton is viewed, with good reason, as the more dishonest candidate in every national and state poll.   A Politico reporter suggested to Clinton’s communication director “the idea of running a     chyron under the candidates during the debates,” and she “leaps out of the chair. ‘Yeah, we would love that!’ she said. ” 9:06: Clinton’s spokesman also said Clinton will express “regret”   asked about her private email server. . @brianefallon: Clinton plans to   Trump she is not going to let falsehoods ”go by the wayside” #Debates https:  .   —   CNN Politics (@CNNPolitics) September 26, 2016,  9:05: Americans more bothered by Clinton’s use of private emails than Trump’s past birtherism: Bloomberg’s poll found that Americans were more bothered by “Clinton’s handling of her private   which the FBI director called ‘extremely careless (57% bothered a lot),’” than “Trump’s   leadership of the   birther controversy (41% bothered a lot). ”   9:00: Clinton reportedly had mock debates at night to mimic the timing of Monday night’s debate. Clinton spent Friday, Saturday and Sunday night at the Doral Arrowwood, returning home past 11 p. m. every night after sessions with a tight group of aides and advisers.
