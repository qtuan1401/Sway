Donald Trump took to Twitter on Tuesday night to respond to Bill Clinton who criticized the Affordable Care Act, also known as Obamacare, while campaigning for his wife in Michigan on Monday. [Wow, did you just hear Bill Clinton’s statement on how bad ObamaCare is. Hillary not happy. As I have been saying, REPEAL AND REPLACE!  —   Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) October 4, 2016,   “So you’ve got this crazy system where all of a sudden 25 million more people have health care and then the people who are out there busting it, sometimes 60 hours a week, wind up with their premiums doubled and their coverage cut in half. It’s the craziest thing in the world,” Clinton said about President Obama’s health care reform during a rally in Flint, Michigan on Monday. Clinton later tried to clarify his comment, according to CNN. “Look, the Affordable Health Care Act did a world of good, and the   efforts to repeal it that the Republicans have staged were a terrible mistake,” Clinton later stated while campaigning in Ohio. “We, for the first time in our history, at least are providing insurance to more than 90% of our people. ” He continued: But there is a group of people  —   mostly small business owners and employees  —   who make just a little too much money to qualify for Medicaid expansion or for the tax incentives who can’t get affordable health insurance premiums in a lot of places. And the reason is they’re not in big pools. Trump responded to Clinton’s comments on Tuesday, saying he bet Clinton “went through hell last night” with his wife, Hillary, after bashing Obamacare. “Honestly, there have been many nights when he’s gone through hell with Hillary,” Trump added.
