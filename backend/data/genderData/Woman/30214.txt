Great work.  —   People For Bernie (@People4Bernie) March 12, 2016,   : How Sanders supporters shut down Trump’s rally in Chicago. https:  .   —   Alex   (@aseitzwald) March 12, 2016,  3:52: [Tony Lee: Just like Trump turned the phony “war on women” rhetoric on its head when he accused Hillary Clinton of enabling her husband’s abuse in a way that the GOP establishment never did (or never even tried because they lacked the intestinal fortitude and are so afraid of not being liked by their mainstream   “bettors”) he is the only Republican candidate using the organized chaos in Chicago on Friday night to call out Clinton, Sanders, and     who shut down a political rally in a way the truly peaceful Tea Party protesters never did. Republicans could have been unified in pointing out that conservative activists peacefully opposed   while   agitators who embody the “Salad Bowl” (instead of melting pot) America that so many Americans rightfully fear are engaging in mayhem and violence. They could have been unified in flipping the script. Instead, Messrs. Rubio, Kasich, and Cruz did what every establishment Republican does in times like this —    blame your own. You’d expect that from Rubio and Kasich, but Cruz’s response —  blaming Trump —  showed that inside, he may actually be the political careerist who has many of the same   characteristics of Hillary Clinton. Trump would not be the best GOP candidate to defeat other Democrats. But he is the perfect candidate to defeat Clinton because he, unlike more conventional Republican candidates whose   the mainstream media try to mute, has the megaphone to call her out on issues like Benghazi and her email scandal and go around the mainstream media’s filters to get his criticisms of Clinton directly to the people. The   media machine would eat   alive. And their reactions to the Chicago chaos reinforced that even more. Because of Trump, Americans who are watching biased mainstream media reports of the Chicago chaos will at least consider that   agitators may be more to blame than Trump’s supporters who just came to see their candidate give a speech. And by challenging the mainstream media’s preferred narrative of “peaceful”   agitators and “violent” conservative citizens, Trump has done much more good for the right than Kasich, Cruz, Rubio did this weekend.] 3:45: Joy Reid on MSNBC points out that Luther Campbell has said that some black voters in barbershops are saying they may vote for Trump because of his message on jobs. She also says there seems to be a lack of enthusiasm among black voters for  . 3:30: Huckabee blasts “thugs” who tried to disrupt Trump’s rally: Mike Huckabee calls Chicago Trump rally protesters ”thugs out on the street”: https:  .   —   Scott Conroy (@ScottFConroy) March 12, 2016,  3:25: On MSNBC, Kevin Cate tells Joy Reid that some voters may just vote for Jeb Bush to spite Rubio on Tuesday. Seems to be a lot of bad blood still between the two camps. Give Joy Reid, who knows Florida’s politics well, for asking Cate if the “first paragraph” in Rubio’s political obituary will be about “immigration” and his support of the Gang of Eight’s amnesty bill. You rarely hear people on   News pointing to immigration as the primary reason that Rubio’s campaign could not get out of the starting gate. Cate says many voters in Florida think Rubio used the Tea Party to get elected and “immediately abandoned” them once he got to Washington. 3:23: Trump praises “perfectly behaved crowd. ” Just finished my second speech. 20K in Dayton  25K in   perfectly behaved crowd.

He also blasts Kasich for his support of TPP. He says Kasich can’t be president because he’s “weak on immigration” and “in favor of amnesty. ” 2:05: Trump says the protesters are going to galvanize more Republicans to go to the polls because they will become “more angry. ” He says Americans are fed up with the stupidity in Washington, the stupidity of labor deals, the fact that they haven’t had wage increases in 12 years. He says we are losing our jobs and factories and they are going to Mexico, China.  [Finally, Trump is getting better with his stump speech and not talking as much about process. He blasts the GOP “elites” on trade —  Trump could point out that what these elites want is a world with no borders to hammer home his campaign themes even more.] 1:55: In Cleveland, Trump asks, “do we love our protesters?  …     Get ’em out of here. Where do these people come from?” Trump says the protesters come from “Bernie’s crowd. ” Trump says they are most likely Bernie’s people because even though some protesters are Clinton supporters, Clinton’s supporters usually lack the “fervor. ” 1:54: Trump successfully challenging the mainstream media’s narrative.
