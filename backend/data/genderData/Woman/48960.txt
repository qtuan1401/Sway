BuzzFeed    Ben   Smith even tweeted, ”Is there a doctor on this flight @united,”   seemingly in response to Peretti’’s comments. ’ ’   When Peretti landed, he told BuzzFeed News a bit more about the   encounter, which allegedly happened about a decade ago at a   Manhattan bar in front of about five other people. ’ ’’ ’   “She was saying how she first said she had never seen an   uncircumcised    and then she said, ‘I’ve never seen a mulatto     . There’s lots of    I’ve never seen,’ or something like   that,” Peretti told BuzzFeed. ’ ’   “Of course, it was memorable just because of the use of the lewd   language and racist language,” he continued. ”It was also   memorable being in the environment of being   …     in New York,   sometimes liberal and progressive people make comments meant as   jokes and not necessarily earnest. I didn’t know how to take it.” ’ ”   Peretti said that he hadn’t revealed the quote before because it   was personal, but that he felt it was relevant because of   comments Ivanka Trump had made at Fortune’s Most Powerful Women   Summit about being taken aback by Donald Trump’s language. ” ’ Nathan McAlone contributed reporting. ’
