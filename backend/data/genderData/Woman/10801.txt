S.  border and enforcing the immigration laws already on the books. President Trump also signed an order suspending the U. S. Refugee Admissions Program for 120 days, which prohibits the arrival of refugees into the United States during that period while the refugee vetting process is being reviewed.

Gigi Hadid faced fierce backlash last November over what critics called a “disgraceful” and “disrespectful” impression of First Lady Melania Trump during the American Music Awards.
