Donald Trump’s senior communications advisor Jason Miller responded to the release of the FBI’s notes on its interview with Hillary Clinton over her private email server, saying the notes reveal Clinton’s “tremendously bad judgment and dishonesty. ”[“Hillary Clinton is applying for a job that begins each day with a Top Secret intelligence briefing, and the notes from her FBI interview reinforce her tremendously bad judgment and dishonesty. Clinton’s secret email server was an end run around government transparency laws that wound up jeopardizing our national security and sensitive diplomatic efforts,” Miller said in a statement released Friday afternoon.  He continued: On more than 2, 000 occasions classified material was exposed on her private server, including highly sensitive Top Secret information and intelligence. All of this was done to conceal what we are once again seeing in the latest email productions from the State Department: rampant conflicts of interest and a    culture that rewarded Clinton Foundation donors with access and favors. “Clinton’s reckless conduct and dishonest attempts to avoid accountability show she cannot be trusted with the presidency and its chief obligation as    of the U. S. armed forces,” Miller concluded.
