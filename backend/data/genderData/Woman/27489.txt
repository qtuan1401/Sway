On the Saturday broadcast of “Justice” on Fox News Channel, host Judge Jeanine Pirro responded to the protestors at GOP presidential candidate Donald Trump’s rallies, blasting them for attempting to stop free speech by interrupting rallies.  “Since when if you state an opinion are you responsible for someone else’s reaction? Since when if you verbally lean right, are you responsible for the left’s physical reaction? Since when do you have the right to interrupt my First Amendment right to listen to a candidate for the highest office in the land? This is America, not the Soviet Union,” Pirro stated. “This is America. You cannot prevent me from speaking or listening. You cannot censor speech. Free speech is guaranteed. It’s why our founding fathers made it their very first amendment to the law of the land. It’s what distinguishes us from communist countries and totalitarian regimes. ” Pirro continued to hammer liberals, saying they are “so dictatorial that they will stop at nothing to prevent free speech even in the cradle of education. ” She added,”‘Black Lives Matter,’ ‘Occupy Wall Street’ determined to disrupt our free discourse so that they can control the narrative. ” Follow Trent Baker on Twitter @MagnifiTrent
