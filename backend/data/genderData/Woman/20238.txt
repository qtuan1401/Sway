John Podesta, Hillary Clinton’s former campaign chair, is fueling conspiracy theories that Russians successfully hacked the election to make Donald Trump the next president. [“We now know that the CIA has determined Russia’s interference in our elections was for the purpose of electing Donald Trump,” he said in a statement to Politico. “This should distress every American. ”  Podesta issued his statement in response to letter from Nancy Pelosi’s daughter Christine, a voting member of the electoral college, to request a security briefing before she casts a ballot. “We further require a briefing on all investigative findings, as these matters directly impact the core factors in our deliberations of whether Mr. Trump is fit to serve as President of the United States,” Pelosi’s letter read. Podesta’s statement floats the suggestion that electors could theoretically select a different candidate for president than Donald Trump. “The bipartisan electors’ letter raises very grave issues involving our national security,” Podesta said in a statement. “Electors have a solemn responsibility under the Constitution and we support their efforts to have their questions addressed. ” Podesta complained that the media failed to report about the threat that Russia posed to their campaign, as he insisted that they were behind the Wikileaks release of his private emails. “Each day that month, our campaign decried the interference of Russia in our campaign and its evident goal of hurting our campaign to aid Donald Trump,” he lamented. “Despite our protestations, this matter did not receive the attention it deserved by the media in the campaign. ”
