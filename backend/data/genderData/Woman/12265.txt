Thursday on Fox News Channel’s “Fox  Friends,” former United Kingdom Independence Party leader Nigel Farage said it was time to ignore 2016 Democratic presidential nominee Hillary Clinton on the heels of her remarks at a tech conference in California criticizing voters.  Farage called Clinton a “sad and pathetic” and a “bad loser” now worthy of being ignored. “I mean, Hillary said the same things about me when I came across and supported Donald Trump in his campaign,” he said. “I don’t think it’s worth getting angry about Hillary. I just think she looks sad and pathetic. There is nothing worse in life than a bad loser, nothing worse than somebody who blames absolutely everybody else for their own failings. And let’s face it, you know, she represented an       establishment. She almost appeared as if it was her right to become the president and I’m very pleased she didn’t. I’ll tell you what  —   let’s just from now ignore her. ” Follow Jeff Poor on Twitter @jeff_poor
