Latin pop singer Prince Royce sang “Happy Birthday” to Democratic presidential candidate Hillary Clinton on Tuesday during her appearance on Univision’s   talk show El Gordo Y La Flaca. [Clinton, who turned 69 on Wednesday, was also treated to a performance by a full mariachi band during her appearance on the program.  “What gets better than this? I get Prince Royce to give me a hug, I get a mariachi band to play for me and I get to be here with you guys. It doesn’t get any better than this” Clinton said, according to Billboard, in a Facebook Live video that has been deleted.  Prince Royce has guest starred this season on Hulu’s TV drama East Los High to encourage Hispanic millennials to vote in the upcoming election. After singing “Happy Birthday,” the Latin   singer formally endorsed Clinton’s candidacy. “I want to motivate everyone to go out and I want Hillary to know that she has my support and that I love her very much,” he said Tuesday. Royce also shared a selfie of himself alongside Clinton with his 6 million Twitter followers.

Last year, Anthony brought Clinton onstage during his Miami concert. Lopez is currently   a   “Love Trumps Hate” concert series in support of Clinton’s campaign. Oddly enough, Clinton was serenaded with an impromptu “Happy Birthday” song by a crowd of supporters in Coconut Creek, Florida earlier this week.
