Leading up to next week’s Indiana primary, GOP presidential   Donald Trump got legendary Indiana University basketball coach Bobby Knight’s endorsement.  Former Gov. Howard Dean ( ) reacted Thursday on MSNBC’s “Morning Joe” to the Knight endorsement by saying Knight’s status in Indiana means his endorsement, unlike most, makes a real difference. “It is the the same as Bear Bryant endorsing somebody in Alabama. I mean, [Knight] did more for Indiana basketball, which I have to say, is the biggest sport in Indiana by far. I do  —   I agree, endorsements usually don’t make much difference. This one does. ” Follow Trent Baker on Twitter @MagnifiTrent
