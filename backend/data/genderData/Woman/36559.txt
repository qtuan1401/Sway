Philadelphia (CNN) Chelsea Clinton will introduce her mother ahead of her Thursday night nomination acceptance speech with remarks she has been writing ”for a couple weeks,” her spokeswoman, Erika Gudmunson, said Tuesday. It will come a week after her friend, Ivanka Trump, introduced her father at the Republican National Convention to much fanfare. For Chelsea Clinton, it’s a responsibility that Gudmunson said the mother of two is taking more seriously than any speech she has ever given before. ”While she had a similar role in 2008, she’s been reflecting in particular on what this moment means now    not just as her mother’s daughter but also now as a mom herself,” Gudmunson said. To prepare, Clinton wrote the speech out weeks ago and has worked to perfect it over the last few weeks. She has also prepared by reading the remarks to her husband, Marc Mezvinsky, Gudmunson said. A friend close to Chelsea, who didn’t want to be identified because they are not authorized to speak on the record, said that while the former first daughter viewed 2008 as a critical election, having two kids has made the issues ”more urgent and personal for her.” Clinton had her first child, Charlotte, 22 months ago, and Aidan, their second child, five weeks ago. People close to Clinton expect her to reflect on being raised in the public eye and the values her mother imparted on her from an early age. Much like former President Bill Clinton’s speech on Tuesday night, Chelsea Clinton’s remarks will look to bolster trust and tout Hillary Clinton’s character.
