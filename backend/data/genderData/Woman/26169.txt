On this weekend’s broadcast of  “Fox News Sunday,” conservative talk radio host Rush Limbaugh said there was a “much bigger upside than downside” if Republican presidential candidate Donald Trump ends up winning the GOP nomination.  Limbaugh said, “I think with the case of Trump, there’s a much bigger upside than downside. A lot of people disagree with me on this. But the people who want somebody not of  Washington, it’s serious this time. The disconnect between the Republican establishment and the Democratic establishment and the people of this country is longer, broader, wider than I have ever seen it. ” Follow Pam Key on Twitter @pamkeyNEN,
