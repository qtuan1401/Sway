’  ’ ”   (Reuters)   Anthony Scaramucci, a hedge fund founder who was a   fundraiser in Donald Trump’s election campaign, will join the    ’s White House staff as an advisor and public   liaison to government agencies and businesses, he said on Friday. ” ”   Scaramucci, founder of Skybridge Capital hedge fund and a former   employee at Goldman Sachs, is a member of Trump’s transition   team. ” ’   He will work as a liaison in the White House for state and local   governments and for both American and foreign businesses,   Scaramucci told reporters in New York. ’ ’   ”One of my other personal goals though is to get all of the   American people to see President Trump the way I see him,” he   added. Trump, a Republican, takes office on Jan. 20. ’ ”   Scaramucci played down media reports from Thursday that he would   hold a position analogous to that currently held by Valerie   Jarrett, who oversees the White House’s Offices of Public   Engagement and Intergovernmental Affairs and is seen as one of   President Barack Obama’s most powerful advisers. ” ’’ ’   ”That’’s probably an overstatement,” Scaramucci said when asked   about the comparison. ”Valerie and I know each other quite well   and I will be speaking to her later in the day. I don’’t want to   overstate the position.” ’ ”   Scaramucci did not discuss what would happen to Skybridge, which   had $12 billion in assets under management or advisement as of   Nov. 30, 2016, down from $12. 9 billion as of Dec. 31, 2015,   according to firm’s website. The firm was put up for auction as   Scaramucci began considering a potential position in the White   House, Reuters reported last month. ” ’     ’ ’   (Reporting by Jonathan Allen; Additional reporting by Lawrence   Delevingne; Editing by Frances Kerry) ’
