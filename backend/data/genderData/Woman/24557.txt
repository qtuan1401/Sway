A panel on Monday’s MSNBC broadcast of “Morning Joe”discussed former president and Democratic presidential   Hillary Clinton’s husband former President Bill Clinton’s relationship with billionaire and convicted sex offender Jeffrey Epstein.  According to “Morning Joe” host Joe Scarborough, he has heard the story on the relationship will “blow up. ” “I will say this was a blind spot for me, because I’m not in New York circles,” said Scarborough. “This is something I have been hearing about for a    half. I don’t know the whole story or anything, but I keep having reporters say, ‘This is going to blow up. ’” Panelist Mike Barnicle predicted the race would get “incredibly ugly,” while former McCain chief strategist Steve Schmidt said he does not think there is “any question” Trump would “go there. ” Schmidt then added that since Hillary is making Bill a part of her campaign, Trump will “do everything to make him an issue in the campaign. ” “In some of the cases, the facts will be uncomfortable for the Clintons,” Bloomberg’s Mark Halperin later chimed in. “The Clinton folks understand now better than they did before that this is a different kind of opponent, and they’ve never run against anybody like this before. ” “She has to stand up herself against a guy with better skills,” Halperin continued.
