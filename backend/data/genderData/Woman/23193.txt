Republican presidential candidate Sen. Ted Cruz ( ) said Tuesday that it would be an “enormous mistake” if Republicans elect Donald Trump as their nominee. [“For any candidate that wakes up tomorrow morning who has not won any states, for any candidate who wakes up tomorrow morning who has a negligible number of delegates, I think it’s time to start thinking about coming together and unifying and presenting a clear choice,” he said. “I believe it would be an enormous mistake to nominate Donald Trump, so I speak to unity for Republicans. ”  “The only campaign that is in a position to beat Donald Trump on Super Tuesday is our campaign, and if you don’t want to see Donald Trump as the nominee, if you don’t want us to give this election to Hillary Clinton, then I ask you to stand with us today. Super Tuesday is the single best opportunity to beat Donald Trump,” Cruz said in Houston.
