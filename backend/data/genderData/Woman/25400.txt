[In a speech at the Code Commerce Conference in California, Dorsey was asked if he felt in any way responsible for the election of Donald Trump as president of the United States. “America is responsible for Donald Trump being president,” replied Dorsey, agreeing that Trump had indeed utilised Twitter in a more effective manner than any of his opponents.   “He’s known how to use it for quite some time,” said Dorsey, referencing   Trump’s regular use of the social media platform. “I think it’s an important time for the company and service. And having the   on our service, using it as a direct line of communication, allows everyone to see what’s on his mind in the moment. I think that’s interesting. I think it’s fascinating. I haven’t seen that before. ” Dorsey elaborated on real time information in the digital age, saying, “We’re definitely entering a new world where everything is on the surface and we can all see it in real time and we can have conversations about it. Where does that go? I’m not really sure. But it’s definitely been fascinating to learn from. ”  Discussing his feelings on   Trump’s use of the platform, Dorsey stated that this feelings were complicated: “I feel very proud of the role of the service and what it stands for and everything that we’ve done, and that continues to accelerate every single day. Especially as it’s had such a spotlight on it through his usage and through the election. ” With Twitter’s crackdown on conservative opinions, such as permanently banning Breitbart Senior Editor MILO, and their recent announcement of new tools to censor “hate speech,”   Trump may have to choose his words wisely if he wants to remain on the social media platform.
