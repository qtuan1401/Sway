Sen. Ted Cruz ( ) and Rep. Ron DeSantis ( .) have revealed their plans to introduce a constitutional amendment that will impose term limits for both congressmen and senators. [In a joint   for The Washington Post, the two Republican firebrands said that term limits would be an effective way for the new Republican administration to “drain the swamp. ”  “We believe that the rise of political careerism in modern Washington is a drastic departure from what the founders intended of our federal governing bodies. To effectively “drain the swamp,” we believe it is past time to enact term limits for Congress. ” A policy of congressional term limits was repeatedly advocated for by   Donald Trump during his presidential campaign, with Speaker of the House Paul Ryan also voicing his support for the idea. The amendment would impose a three term limit for members of congress and a two term limit for senators. Both Cruz and DeSantis also point to the “broad support” for congressional term limits, citing a Ramussen survey conducted in October that showed 74% of likely voters supported the idea. Proposals to impose congressional term limits have been voted on before, with a 1998 proposal failing to receive the necessary two thirds support for passage. Similarly in 2012, the Senate overwhelmingly rejected a   measure endorsing the amendment. “The time is now for Congress, with the overwhelming support of the American people, to pass a constitutional amendment establishing congressional term limits and send it to the states for speedy ratification,” the pair said. “With control of a decisive majority of the states, the executive branch, the House of Representatives and the Senate, the Republican Party has the responsibility to respond to the voters’ call to action. We must, and we can, deliver,” they concluded. You can follow Ben Kew on Facebook, on Twitter at @ben_kew, or email him at bkew@breitbart. com
