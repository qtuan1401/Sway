Former Miss Universe Alicia Machado introduced Hillary Clinton on the campaign trail in Florida this afternoon, by accusing Donald Trump of being mean to her when she was crowned in the beauty pageant. [Machado painted herself as the victim, pointing out that she was only 18 years old, calling herself “a little girl” that was “scared of Trump” because he “called me names. ”  “He made fun of me and I didn’t know how to respond,” she said in broken English. “He told me that I looked ugly and I was massive. ” She added that Trump called her names like “Miss Piggy” “Miss Housekeeping” and “Miss Eating Machine. ” “It was really painful for me,” she said. “He was cruel” She urged Florida voters to join her in fighting Trump and began a “No Trump!” chant in the crowd. “Together we are going to say loudly and clearly ‘No Trump,’ she said. “He’s not getting away with it. ” She said she supported Clinton because she was committed to allowing illegal immigrants stay in the United States and giving them a path to citizenship. “She’s going to fight to fix our broken immigration system so families can stay together and everyone can take part in the American dream,” she said. Clinton took the stage reminding her supporters that Trump spent his life “demeaning, degrading, and assaulting” women like Machado.  Clinton shamed Trump for his treatment of Machado, referring to a press conference with Machado after she gained weight. “Well, she put on some weight and it made him angry so he called her Miss Piggy, called her Miss Housekeeping because she is a beautiful Latina,” Clinton said. She defended Machado from Trump’s assertion that the former Miss Universe enjoyed eating.  “I have to say, who doesn’t like to eat?” she said with a smile.
