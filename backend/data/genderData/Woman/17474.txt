GOP frontrunner Donald Trump’s campaign is pulling an attack ad against Sen. Ted Cruz ( ) to replace it with a more positive message in South Carolina. [“Right now we are running a positive campaign for Mr. Trump,” Corey Lewandowski, Trump’s campaign manager told CNN.  CNN reports: The Trump campaign has relied almost exclusively on “earned media” coverage of his rallies on live television and   interviews to cable shows to build his name as a contender. But he bought time   against Cruz last month when the Texas senator emerged as a threat. The new positive spot features Trump supporters delivering testimonials supporting Trump’s message and lacks much of the negativity that has been a hallmark of Trump’s campaign. “We have a country that we’re proud of and we love and we’re not going to lose,” Trump states in the add that is titled, “Voters Speak. ” The Trump campaign may use the ad against Cruz in the future, CNN noted.
