 (CNN) David Letterman says he had no regrets about retiring from his   comedy show    until Donald Trump’s presidential campaign took off. ”I have made the biggest mistake of my life, ladies and gentlemen,” Letterman told an audience Saturday night in San Antonio. In a surprise appearance at a show hosted by fellow comedians Steve Martin and Martin Short, Letterman reprised his famous ’Top 10’ list to chide Trump, the real estate mogul who has shot near the front of the Republican field even as he’s made controversial remarks about undocumented immigrants from Mexico.  In his satirical list of Trump ’facts,’ Letterman said, ”That thing on his head was the gopher in ’Caddyshack. ’” His quips also included that Trump wears 10 pounds of cologne and would evict a family, rather than pardon a turkey, on Thanksgiving. And referencing Martin and Short’s comedy ”¡Three Amigos!” Letterman offered: ”Donald Trump has pissed off so many Mexicans, he’s starring in a movie called ’No Amigos. ’”
