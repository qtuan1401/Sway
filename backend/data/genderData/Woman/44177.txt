’  ’ ’   The ranking Democrat on the Senate Intelligence Committee, Sen.   Mark Warner, said on Tuesday that former acting Attorney General   Sally Yates ”is an individual we’’re going to want to talk to” as   part of the committee’’s investigation into Russia’’s interference   in the 2016 election. ’ ’  ’ ’  ’ ’  ’ ’  ’ ’  ’ ’  ’ ’   White House press secretary Sean Spicer strongly pushed back   against the report on Tuesday, calling it ”100% false.” ’ ’   ”I hope she testifies,” Spicer said. ”I look forward to it.” ’ ”   The report about Yates has compounded speculation that the   White House is trying to interfere in the House Intelligence   Committee’s Russia probe. ” ”   Last week, the committee’s chairman, Rep. Devin Nunes, traveled   to the White House w ” ’   ’ ’  ’ ’   National security experts and White House reporters have argued   that it is  Nunes could have obtained   access to the White House grounds unnoticed, while members   of Congress are wondering why Nunes would go around his committee   to brief Trump on the documents directly.  ’ ’  ’ ’  ’ ’  ’ ’The ranking Democrat on the Senate Intelligence. ..’ ’’ ’’ ’’
