 (CNN) Donald Trump’s campaign spokeswoman Katrina Pierson explained Wednesday why she does not believe Jessica Leeds’ story reported by the New York Times that Donald Trump touched her inappropriately during a first class flight more than 30 years ago.  ”We’re talking about the early 1980’s,” Pierson said on ”CNN Tonight with Don Lemon.” ”First class seats have fixed armrests. So what I can tell you if she was groped on a plane, it wasn’t by Donald Trump and it certainly wasn’t in first class.”   Leeds’ told the New York Times that when sitting next to Trump during a first class flight, Trump lifted the armrest, moved toward her, and then began to grope her.  CNN has not yet independently confirmed The New York Times report. RELATED: Trump faces more groping allegations  While modern first class seating on US carriers have fixed armrests as a   beverage tray, several airlines    including the   Braniff Airways    featured first class seats in the 1970s and 1980s that had a movable armrest that folded down between the window and aisle seats.
