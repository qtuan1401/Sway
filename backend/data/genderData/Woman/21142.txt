Tuesday at a press gathering on the campaign trail in Raleigh, NC, Sen. Ted Cruz ( ) responded to the controversy involving Republican presidential candidate Donald Trump asking his supporters at a rally to raise their hands for a loyalty pledge that some have compared to a salute from Nazi Germany.  Cruz said, “No political candidate is going to make America great again. It is not going to be Donald Trump, it is not going to be me. The only power strong enough to restore the nation is we the people. It is not about us. It is about we the people. The idea you would take this loyalty of I  and I take an oath to you, to the people —  that’s who’s working for whom. The idea that a candidate running for office wants the people to pledge loyalty to him like subjects to a king, well, we’ve had seven years of a president who thinks he is an emperor. I’ve got to say, the only   I’m interested in is on January 20, 2017, when I hope to raise my right hand and have my left hand sitting on the Bible when I make a promise, a pledge to every American to preserve, protect and defend the Constitution of the United States. ” Follow Pam Key on Twitter @pamkeyNEN
