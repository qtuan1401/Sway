Sunday, on NBC’s “Meet the Press,” while commenting on the racial divide in America exasperated by the recent police shootings in Louisiana and Minnesota and a sniper targeting and killing five Dallas police officers, Sen. Bob Corker ( ) said “I think there is going to be a sincere effort within the Trump campaign,” to unify the country.  Partial transcript as follows: CHUCK TODD: Senator Corker, you know, the rhetoric on the campaign trail has been heated and has been divisive. The country believes both candidates are polarizing, for various reasons and different reasons. What’s your  —   I’m going to start with you, Senator Corker, what’s your advice to  —   how does Donald Trump make the case that he can unify this country and heal these wounds? And then I’ll ask Senator Booker to make the case on the other side. CORKER: Look, I think both of the candidates, their challenge over the coming weeks is to show that they can do that. I think there’s going to be a sincere effort within the Trump campaign to do so. My guess is, the same thing will be happening in the Clinton campaign. There’s no question, put this campaign aside. Look, the conversation in America has been way divisional. It’s not been appropriate. It’s been that way for sometime. And it adds to this, but let’s get back to it again. You know, the mayor of a city is where most of this occurs, and I’m not in any way criticizing what happened in Dallas, but it’s those local efforts that actually bring people together. No doubt the discourse, no doubt the videos that people can see, no doubt those things affect things throughout our country, but look, I hope that both of these candidates, candidly, will rise to the occasion, and on this particular issue, bring people together.
