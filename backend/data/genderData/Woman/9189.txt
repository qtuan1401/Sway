President Donald Trump’s 2018 budget plan asks Congress for enough money to build just 60 miles of border wall. [The request for just $1. 6 billion in wall funding is found in the budget document released by the Department of Homeland Security, which describes the agency’s   plan for spending its overall 2018 budget of $70. 7 billion.
