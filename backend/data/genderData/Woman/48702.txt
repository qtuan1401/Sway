’   Donald Trump campaign manager Kellyanne Conway found herself in   unfriendly waters Thursday when she appeared on “The View” and   was pressed repeatedly over her candidate’s refusal to release   his tax returns. ’ ’   Whoopi Goldberg, a cohost on the ABC daytime program, grilled   Conway on the issue for several minutes. ’ ’   “Where are his damn tax returns? And why don’t we know what he   spent? Where is it?” Goldberg asked, claiming Hillary Clinton had   been more transparent than Trump. ’ ’   Conway said Goldberg’s characterization of Clinton as transparent   was not true, saying she wanted to know what Clinton ”was   hiding in the 30, 000 emails she deleted.” ’ ’ ’ ’   Goldberg moved the conversation back to Trump. ’ ’’ ’   “What is Donald Trump hiding by not releasing that   information?” she asked. ’ ’   “So there is a   financial disclosure form you can   access,” Conway replied. ’ ’   “I want to know, since every other president has had to do it,   where are the tax returns?” Goldberg shot back. “That’s what I   want to know. ” ’ ’   Conway responded with Trump’s usual talking points, saying the   tax returns were “under audit” and that it would be legally   unwise to release the documents as the Internal Revenue Service   reviews them. ’ ’   “That’s bull! It’s bull!” Goldberg erupted. “What is he hiding?   What is he hiding? What is he hiding?” ’ ’   “He’s not hiding anything,” Conway insisted. ’ ’   “I think he is,” Goldberg quipped. ’ ’   While Trump won’t release his tax returns for the public to   examine,  on Wednesday   that the   tycoon has turned the documents over in the   past when it benefited him, such as for a loan. ’ ’   Every GOP presidential nominee since Richard Nixon has released   his tax returns. ’
