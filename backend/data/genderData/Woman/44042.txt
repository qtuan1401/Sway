’  ’ ’   Bernie Sanders is a   socialist who railed against   the power of the wealthy elite during his 2016 presidential run. ’ ’   But despite that, he does not support the alternative minimum   tax, which was enacted with the intention of making sure the uber   rich pay their fair share of taxes. ’ ”   The tax made headlines this week when MSNBC revealed President   Donald Trump’s 2005 tax return.
