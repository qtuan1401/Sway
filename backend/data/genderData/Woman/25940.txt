New York City Comptroller Scott Stringer has declared that he will conduct an official audit of the New York City Board of Elections in response to many claims of polling irregularities and errors throughout the city’s primary voting system Tuesday. [Stringer released a statement Tuesday afternoon casting doubt on the integrity of the New York primary on both sides of the aisle and indicting the Board of Elections (BOE):  There is nothing more sacred in our nation than the right to vote, yet election after election, reports come in of people who were inexplicably purged from the polls, told to vote at the wrong location or unable to get in to their polling site. The people of New York City have lost confidence that the Board of Elections can effectively administer elections and we intend to find out why the BOE is so consistently disorganized, chaotic and inefficient. Stringer also reportedly wrote a letter to the executive director of BOE listing complaints that he’s received from voters, including reports of an indefinitely closed polling station in Williamsburg, Brooklyn. For his part, BOE executive director said, “We’re just not seeing it,” referring to major systemic problems all over the city Tuesday. Donald Trump’s name was reportedly left off thousands of New York Republican primary ballots in New York State. Trump so far has not weighed in on the ballot error reports.
