Kellyanne Conway,   Donald Trump’s campaign manager, called upon President Barack Obama, Hillary Clinton, and other Democratic leaders to calm down their supporters who are protesting Trump and encourage a peaceful transition of power. [“He is going to be a president that listens and takes the counsel of many different people, including those from the other side of the aisle,” Conway told Chuck Todd on NBC’s Meet the Press on Sunday. “It’s time really for President Obama and Secretary Clinton to say to these protesters, ‘This man is our president. ’”  Clinton has already done so, urging her supporters to give him “an open mind and a chance to lead. ” “Donald Trump is going to be our president, we owe him an open mind and a chance to lead,” Clinton admitted to her close aides and supporters. President Obama has said that he will work with   Trump to make sure there is a smooth transition of power so that Trump’s presidency is successful. Conway said to Chris Wallace on Fox News Sunday that paid, professional protesters were behind most of the   protests across the country. When Wallace asked Conway what Trump would do to reach out to those scared to be under his presidency, Conway responded that Trump’s victory speech was “off to a great start” in unifying the country.
