Hillary Clinton’s campaign manager Robby Mook avoided answering a question about why the Clinton Foundation is still accepting money from foreign governments during two interviews Sunday morning. [The Clinton Foundation is still taking foreign dollars while Hillary is running for president, despite Bill Clinton’s promise that it would stop taking foreign cash if Hillary Clinton gets elected president.  “Hillary Clinton says The Clinton Foundation will stop taking donations from corporations and foreign governments if she is elected President,” Republican consultant Brad Marston wrote on Facebook. “So: ON SALE NOW. ACCESS AND INFLUENCE! ONLY 80 DAYS LEFT. ALL SALES FINAL!” Mook struggled to dodge the question on CNN Sunday. Trying to deflect to Republican presidential candidate Donald Trump, Mook declared, “Trump hasn’t released a serious health letter yet. ” Mook also flopped on the question on ABC.
