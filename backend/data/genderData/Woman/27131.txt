Tom Coyne, a lifelong Democrat and the mayor of Brook Park, Ohio, spoke about his endorsement of Republican presidential nominee Donald Trump with Breitbart News Daily SiriusXM host Matt Boyle. [Coyne said:  The parties are blurred. What’s the difference? They say the same things in different tones. At the end of the day, they accomplish nothing. Donald Trump is challenging the very fabric of the institutional elites in this country on both sides that have, quite frankly, just straight up screwed this country up and made the world a mess. Regarding the GOP establishment’s   Never Trumpers, Coyne stated, “If it’s their expertise that people are relying upon as to advice to vote, people should go the opposite. ” Coyne has been described as “a   populist, blunt and politically incorrect”: In an interview last week, Coyne said that Democrats and Republicans have failed the city through inaction and bad trade policies, key themes Trump often trumpets. “He understands us,” Coyne said of Trump. “He is saying what we feel, and therefore, let him shake the bedevils out of everyone in the canyons of Washington D. C. The American people are responding to him. ” Breitbart News Daily airs on SiriusXM Patriot 125 weekdays from 6:00 a. m. to 9:00 a. m. Eastern. LISTEN:
