Almost a third of all homes in the area flooded after the levee system failed to keep water out. Control systems proved unreliable, with the Laurel Ridge Levee toppled. Despite the levee structure being overcome with floodwaters, the Ascension Parish Office of Homeland Security said in a Facebook post that the levee had not suffered any breaks, breaches or even structural damage. Parish officials estimate that some 15, 000 homes have been flooded in the region, with the majority in the Galvez and St. Amant areas. “The next 24 to 48 hours is going to be a significant indication of just how much risk the parish remains in,” director of the Ascension Office of Homeland Security Rick Webre said in an emergency statement at the time. Trump sent his condolences and prayers to Louisiana flood victims yesterday during a speech in Charlotte, North Carolina, as Breitbart Texas reported. “I’d like to take a moment to talk about the heartbreak and devastation in Louisiana, a state that is very, very special to me,” Trump told the crowd at the opening of his rally. “We are one nation. When one state hurts, we all hurt,” Trump continued. “And we must all work together to lift each other up. ” “I hope everyone in Louisiana knows that our country is praying for them and standing with them to help them in these difficult hours,” Trump said. “They are very, very difficult. ” John Binder is a contributor for Breitbart Texas.
