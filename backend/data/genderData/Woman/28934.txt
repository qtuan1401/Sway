Legendary standup comic Jackie Mason is not a fan of the #NeverTrump movement, slamming the   movement as “nothing but disgusting pigs and low lifes. ”[Mason was speaking during his regular segment on this reporter’s talk radio program, “Aaron Klein Investigative Radio,” broadcast on New York’s AM 970 The Answer and NewsTalk 990 AM in Philadelphia. The recorded segment is set to air on Sunday night.  Asked for his opinion on the #Never Trump movement, the comic stated: This never Trump movement shows that these people are nothing but disgusting pigs and low lifes. These words I am using very carefully and purposely because this is exactly what they are. They are pigs and low lifes. When he (Trump) was refusing to make the pledge at the debates they all attacked him that they found it’s ungentlemanly. It’s indecent. It’s obnoxious. It’s disgusting. If you remember (they said) in the club you stay by the rules. In a club you abide by the rules and whoever wins is the winner and you should pledge to support the winner. That’s what people do who are members of the club. Because the club is more important than the question of who is the winner. And that’s the rule they applied to him. But they forgot that they are in the same club. Somebody would think that he is the only member. And they don’t belong there. And this rule was perfect for him. In other words, this was a perfect pledge if they win. Aaron Klein is Breitbart’s Jerusalem bureau chief and senior investigative reporter.
