Hollywood celebrities took to Twitter Thursday to weigh in on the airstrikes in Syria authorized by U. S. President Donald Trump in retaliation for an earlier chemical weapon attack by Syrian president Bashar  . [While many of those celebrities who reacted to the strikes condemned the president and called him a “hypocrite,” a number of stars reacted with both shock and sadness.  Actress Kerry Washington wrote simply that she was “heartbroken,” while actress Lena Dunham turned to prayer. Below is a sampling of Hollywood’s reaction to the American airstrikes in Syria. 🚽Bombing Syria Will,🙏🏻 Stop Assad Gassing His Ppl, BUT🚽Has NO Strategy, Or, Diplomacy‼️ TURKEY  RUSSIA WINNERS‼️🚽IN HORNETS NEST, OVER HIS👨  —   Cher (@cher) April 7, 2017,  Wait.
