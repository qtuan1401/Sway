’  ’ ”   Democratic Sen. Al Franken asked former Deputy Attorney General   Sally Yates on Monday why the Trump administration waited   nearly three weeks to fire former National Security Adviser   Michael Flynn after Yates had warned the White   House’s top lawyers that Flynn could be susceptible to   blackmail by the Russians. ” ”   That assessment came after US intelligence agencies captured   Flynn’s discussions of US economic sanctions against Russia with   that country’s ambassador, Sergey Kislyak, shortly before   President Donald Trump was inaugurated. ” ’   During a hearing in front of the Senate Judiciary Subcommittee on   Crime and Terrorism, Franken pointed to others in the Trump   administration who also revealed their contacts with Kislyak   after it became clear that Flynn misled White House   officials about his conversations with the ambassador. ’ ’   Speaking to Trump’’s decisions about Flynn, Franken said, ”he   didn’’t get rid of a guy who lied to the vice president, who got   paid by the Russians.” Franken called Flynn ”a danger to this   republic.” ’ ”   Yates declined to comment on Franken’s characterization of the   events. She told the Senate subcommittee that she had met   with White House Counsel Donald McGahn on January 26 to   inform him that statements Vice President Mike Pence had made   insisting that Flynn did not discuss US sanctions with the   Russian ambassador were false. ” ’ ’ ’Sen.
