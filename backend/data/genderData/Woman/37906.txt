Buzz Aldrin, astronaut, The Apollo landings on the Moon inspired a generation of engineers and scientists to develop an unprecedented array of skills, talents and technologies.

There is currently bipartisan support in Congress to reform wasteful and outdated policies in our federal justice system.  As president of the United States, what will you do specifically with members of Congress on both sides of the aisle to make our federal justice system smarter and more  ? John Walsh is   on the National Center for Missing  Exploited Children and host of CNN’s ”The Hunt”.

Vicente Fox was president of Mexico from  .  Carl Bernstein, journalist and author  Mr. Trump, you have said your taxes are under audit  and thus you can’t let us see them. However, please simply tell us how much federal tax you paid in each of the past ten years —  especially in light of the demonstrated fact that  you paid no federal tax in   two of the few years we have any of your old tax records available for examination. The suspicion among some people is that you have paid no federal taxes in most years during the past decade. Is that correct? Carl Bernstein is as a Pulitzer Prize winning journalist and author.

What lessons have you learned from these decisions and why should American voters trust you to manage our country’s affairs in the future? Mr Trump: You have justified unconstitutional policies, like a ban on Muslims entering the country, on the grounds of national security. Is it not reasonable for Americans to wonder what else national security can justify? If for example it is too risky to allow Muslims into America, why should we permit those Muslims already here to stay? Would it be acceptable for the government to deport, detain or deny entry to any demographic we face any degree of threat from?

Danielle Pletka, foreign policy commentator, Over the last eight years, al Qaeda, notwithstanding the death of Osama bin Laden, has spread dramatically. The group and its affiliates is now operating and controlling territory in more than a dozen countries. The Obama administration has focused almost exclusively on ISIS and al Qaeda has flourished.

Hillary Clinton: When Harry Truman completed his term as president, he declined to accept any corporate fees for speeches stating: ” You don’t want me. You want the office of the president, and that doesn’t belong to me.

Why do you disagree with Harry Truman on this principle? Paul Callan is a CNN legal analyst and a former media law professor.

You’ve called half of Donald Trump’s supporters ’deplorable.’ What would you say to these voters about why they should vote for you?

Mel Robbins is a CNN commentator, legal analyst and the CEO of Mel Robbins Enterprises, a management consulting firm.

Leroy Chiao, astronaut, Without bold political and financial commitments to a clearly defined international program with milestones and dates, the United States is in real danger of losing the lead position in human space exploration.

Leroy Chiao is an American engineer, motivational speaker, former NASA astronaut and an engineering consultant.  Gene Karpinski, activist, Polls show that millennials    a critical voting bloc     are concerned with climate change and are more likely to vote for a candidate who will take action on climate.
