Donald Trump’s social media director Dan Scavino is reminding people that Rev. Jesse Jackson, who recently blamed Trump’s rhetoric for creating division in America, previously praised him for “reaching out and being inclusive. ”[Doesn’t fit the MSM narrative  —   so they wont share what @realDonaldTrump did for Jesse Jackson in 1999  —   so I will! pic. twitter.   —   Dan Scavino Jr. (@DanScavino) September 3, 2016,   “I now want to bring forth a friend who while he is deceptive of his social style  …    one can miss his seriousness and his commitment, but his success is beyond argument,” Jackson states about Trump in a video, which was shared by Scavino purportedly from 1999 about the Rainbow PUSH Wall Street Project. “In terms of reaching out and being inclusive, he’s done that too,” Jackson adds. In the video, Jackson states that the real estate mogul has “the will to risk to make things better  …    aside from all of his style and his pizzaz, he’s a serious person who is an effective builder. ” He then introduces Trump to speak for a few minutes on “challenges and opportunities to embrace the underserved communities. ” Trump, who was greeted by applause, takes the podium and says, “A large percentage of the people and especially in construction that are building these great jobs are blacks and minorities and I’m very proud of it. We have close to 25 percent and I think the number is going up and they do a great job. ” Scavino’s flashback video post on Twitter comes after Jackson appeared on television in July following several shootings against law enforcement, saying Trump’s divisive “rhetoric has helped to seed these clouds. ” Trump has spent the last several weeks trying to reach out to minority voters and campaigned with Dr. Ben Carson in Detroit, where he joined a black church service on Saturday.
