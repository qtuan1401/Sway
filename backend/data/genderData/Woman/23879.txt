Friday on Fox News Channel’s “Fox  Friends,” Republican   nominee Gov. Mike Pence ( ) questioned the accuracy of polling, which shows his running mater Donald Trump behind against his opponent Democratic presidential nominee Hillary Clinton.  Pence pointed to the attendance of Trump’s rallies and said that suggests something different is going on that isn’t reflected by the polls. “I honestly think that there’s something missing in the polling these days,” Pence said. “I think Donald Trump has made a connection to the frustrations and aspirations of everyday Americans like no one in my lifetime has since Ronald Reagan. When you see against this avalanche, present company excepted here at Fox News, but this avalanche of negative media coverage that goes chasing after every potential negative story about Donald Trump, still you see tens of thousands of people coming out at rallies. There’s a determination out there across the country to change the direction of this nation. ” Follow Jeff Poor on Twitter @jeff_poor
