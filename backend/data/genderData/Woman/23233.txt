Fox News Channel host Greg Gutfeld argued GOP presidential candidate Donald Trump should “save the whine” over the results in Iowa, and compared him to President Obama on Wednesday’s broadcast of “The Five. ”  Gutfeld stated that Trump’s humility “came and went like bad Chipotle. ” He added, “Now remember, Donald was the chap who pushed Canadian birtherism, a dirty trick meant to keep folks from supporting Ted. So, he’s calling Cruz a sleaze. Please, if Ted were on ‘The Apprentice,’ Donald would crown him winner for that move, so save the whine.   …     But now he’s back to his old self. He blames Iowans for not appreciating him, and bashes the media he so easily dominates. Who’s that remind you of? And isn’t skipping a debate a lot like skipping a national security meeting? Are we sure Trump isn’t Obama in orangeface? Anyway, this smacks of that rich kid on the block, who when he loses a coin toss, takes the ball and goes home. In this case the ball is the media, that drooling horde wondering what’s in it for them. ” Gutfeld concluded the monologue by suggesting Iowa actually have a   like Trump wants, which would result in Trump doing very poorly. Later he said that Cruz’s voter violation flyer was a “dirty trick,” but he doesn’t think anyone really took it seriously. Follow Ian Hanchett on Twitter @IanHanchett
