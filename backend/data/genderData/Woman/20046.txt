Conservative movement professionals in Washington, D. C. are plotting to form a “blacklist” of Donald Trump supporters that they can kick out of the movement, never to return. [Several conservative talking heads and Beltway consultant types have been very angry about the rise of businessman Trump, who is pushing for American sovereignty, a reversal of neoconservative foreign policy, and competitive bidding for pharmaceuticals even though the drug companies that fund the Republican Party would take a financial hit.  So far,   think pieces referencing William F. Buckley have been ineffective. Memes comparing Trump to Hitler haven’t worked. So these Republicans are getting more  . They’re coming out with an Enemies List. CNN contributor and former Ted Cruz spokeswoman Amanda Carpenter volunteered to take the lead in writing the list. Has anyone compiled the definitive list of conservatives who should be blackballed for supporting Trump? I will if it doesn’t exist.  —   Amanda Carpenter (@amandacarpenter) March 16, 2016,  But Carpenter, who once got called an “idiot” by Donald Trump, did not mention that she formerly defended Trump on numerous occasions. Luckily, savvy Twitter users pointed it out for her in the responses below her tweet. Carpenter later explained the terms for inclusion on her “blacklist. ” My blacklist is limited to people who have formally endorsed Trump. Not those who simply explain the phenomenon.  https:  .   —   Amanda Carpenter (@amandacarpenter) March 17, 2016,  Carpenter is not alone in calling for a blacklist. Red State contributing editor Ben Howe said that he has the resources to get a   “blacklist” off the ground, as well as seed money from God knows who in the donor class. @amandacarpenter I’ve got a web designer who says he’ll build the website for free and several people who say they’ll chip in money for host,  —   Ben Howe (@BenHowe) March 16, 2016,  Others in the conservative media industry have called for “no forgiveness” for “Trump enablers” and have warned that the conservative movement will “never forget. ” These are the Trump enablers for whom there can be no forgiveness. https:  .  pic. twitter.   —   Sonny Bunch (@SonnyBunch) March 6, 2016,  Message to conservative Trump shills who sold the movement out and bowed before Trump: we will never forget, and we don’t want you back.  —   Matt Walsh (@MattWalshBlog) March 5, 2016,  Matt Walsh compiled a preliminary blacklist over at the Blaze. Walsh listed: Sean Hannity, Ann Coulter, Bill O’Reilly, Laura Ingraham, Sarah Palin, Fox News, Chris Christie, Ben Carson, Jeff Sessions, The Drudge Report, Breitbart, Jerry Falwell Jr. and Robert Jeffress. But what exactly are these people banning Trump supporters from? As Walsh noted, Jeff Sessions, Sarah Palin, and Ben Carson have all endorsed Trump. Rush Limbaugh and Sean Hannity are sympathetic voices in the media. Herman Cain likes him. Phyllis Schlafly loves him. Newt Gingrich has affirmed, here on the pages of Breitbart, that Trump is a member of the very same conservative movement that he, Gingrich, led in the 1990s and still has considerable influence over. Oh yeah, and Trump won the South Carolina primary and is leading the field right now in delegates. Why not a “blacklist” for conservatives who sold out the movement, and their own country, by embracing amnesty and the doctrine of open borders? Why not a “blacklist” for those who wrecked the New American Century within three years by staging a     experiment in the Middle East? Why not a “blacklist” for those currently trying to broker the convention to throw out the will of the people, or those who would rather support Hillary Clinton because at least they’ll still be able to gin up donations for opposing her? Are you banning the Trump supporters from a movement in which Tea Party Patriots featured Trump as a headliner at their rally against the Iran deal back in September  —   only to have Jenny Beth Martin come out at CPAC and tell people that he loves himself more than America and that he’s not really a member of the Tea Party movement? Such is the nature of movements. They’re always on the move. Here’s a full list of the Trump endorsers who are already on the blacklist, according to Carpenter’s Conservative Review piece “Blackballing Those Who Endorse Trump”: See more at: https:  . conservativereview.        #sthash.
