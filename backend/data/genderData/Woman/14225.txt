Sunday on NBC’s “Meet the Press,” newly elected Democratic National Committee chairman Tom Perez said President Donald Trump, had not proposed anything “but chaos and carnage. ”  Partial transcript as follows: TODD: What is, though, you’re out there and even the words impeachment was thrown a lot during the democratic gathering and this idea of resistance and even Hillary Clinton calling for resistance of the party. If that’s the message, does that mean, is that a signal to the Senate and House Democrats you can’t work with President Trump no matter what he proposes? PEREZ:  Well, he hasn’t proposed anything but chaos and carnage. TODD: He’s talking about a trillion dollar infrastructure proposal and something that Bernie Sanders has been talking about for a decade. (  Grabien) Follow Pam Key on Twitter @pamkeyNEN
