Facebook is developing a feature that will promote content in people’s news feeds from publishers specifically chosen by the company, according to a report from Business Insider. [The feature, which will be known as Collections, will reportedly promote news stories, videos, and other content from publishers “handpicked” by Facebook.  Business Insider, who say they have spoken to people involved in the project as well as seeing internal Facebook documentation, reports that Facebook are planning on approaching their preferred media companies in the coming weeks. As a result of the Collections system, partner companies chosen by Facebook will achieve a far greater reach to Facebook’s 1. 8 billion user base than they would normally. In the run up the election, Facebook   Dustin Moskovitz gave over $35 million to   causes in an attempt to defeat Donald Trump, whilst Hillary Clinton was the largest single beneficary of political donations from Facebook employees. The development comes following hysteria surrounding the rise of “fake news,” with many people blaming the role of social media, particularly Facebook, for the election of Donald Trump. However, Facebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg has rejected this claim, describing it as “crazy. ” “The idea that fake news on Facebook, of which it’s a very small amount of the content, influenced the election is a pretty crazy idea,” Zuckerberg said at the time. A Facebook spokesperson declined to respond to Business Insiders’s request for comment. You can follow Ben Kew on Facebook, on Twitter at @ben_kew, or email him at bkew@breitbart. com
