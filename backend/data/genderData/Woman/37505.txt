 (CNN) Editor’s Note: The full interview with Vice President Joe Biden is scheduled to air on CNN’s ”New Day” Tuesday morning. Vice President Joe Biden says Hillary Clinton knows many Americans don’t trust her    ”and she’s trying to figure out how to remedy it.”  ”My advice to her: The best way to remedy it is, talk about what you care about and talk about it with some passion. And people will see through it,” Biden told CNN’s Jeff Zeleny in an interview Monday in Pittsburgh. Biden was in Western Pennsylvania as part of a campaign swing with Democratic vice presidential nominee Tim Kaine. The full Biden interview is scheduled to air on CNN’s ”New Day” Tuesday morning. Biden’s comments, just nine weeks from the 2016 general election, come as polls show Donald Trump making up some of the ground he’d lost to Clinton in early August.  For Clinton, under constant siege over her use of a private email server as secretary of state and facing questions over whether Clinton Foundation donors had improper access to her State Department, polls have shown trustworthiness is her most significant weakness. Almost   of Americans saying they don’t see her as honest and trustworthy, according to surveys. Biden    who himself passed on a 2016 White House bid    said it’ll be a challenge for any candidate to deliver a message that breaks through the attacks and criticism Clinton and Trump are launching at each other.  ”This is going to be the most negative campaign in the history of modern politics, I think,” Biden said.  ”And so my question is, is anybody going to be able to break through what is just a    you know, sort of the notion of, a pox on both your houses?” he said. ”And that’s why you hear her talking more about explicitly what it is she’s going to do, how she’s going to change things.”
