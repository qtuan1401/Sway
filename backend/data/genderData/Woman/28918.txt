On Sean Hannity’s radio show earlier this week, American Freedom Defense Initiative president Pamela Geller said the “Clinton Cash” movie, which details the corrupt financial dealings of the Democratic   Hillary Clinton “should be de rigueur viewing for every concerned American. ”  Geller said, “I mean remember they left the White House claiming they were broke. They now of a net worth of 200 million dollars. They didn’t built anything, they didn’t create anything. They don’t have a company, but they get from these very sketchy governments,  Bill Clinton gets 750, 000 dollars to speak. There is a movie coming out now called, “Clinton Cash. ” It is a devastating, stunning indictment  …    . It it pure evil.  And anyone on the right whose hashtag is Never Trump, so on and so forth, is aiding and abetting in the election of a clearly corrupt  —  and not just her but her husband  so you’ll have them both in the White House —    a clearly corrupt regime. That movie honestly it should be de rigueur viewing for every concerned American. It is devastating, the level of corruption, that kind of money they received. And kinda malfeasance they did in Haiti or I should say what they didn’t do in Haiti . How much money they got when nothing was accomplished. And the selling of uranium rights here in America  —   20 percent of the uranium is now owned by Russia. I could  it to go on and on. But you’re absolutely right. I believe Clinton was paid off and she’ll continue to get paid off. There is no reason to believed that the past behavior for 20 years is going to change.
