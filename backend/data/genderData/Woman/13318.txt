A Dallas public school teacher was filmed in her classroom mockingly shooting President Donald Trump as a live feed was projected of his inauguration ceremony. [In the short clip, the teacher can be heard shrieking, saying the word “die” and then routinely shooting at the projected image of Trump with a toy gun.   The Instagram video originally posted has since been removed after going viral, with the link taking social media users to a page that reads “Sorry, this page isn’t available. ” The Dallas Independent School District confirmed to Breitbart Texas in a written statement the person depicted is indeed a DISD employee at W. H. Adamson High School, but would not share more until its investigation was complete. The teacher has been placed on administrative leave. John Binder is a contributor for Breitbart Texas.
