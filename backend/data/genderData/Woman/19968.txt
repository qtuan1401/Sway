Sen. Ted Cruz ( ) can add Nebraska to his list of states where he’s out organized GOP frontrunner Donald Trump in collecting delegates. [“Party officials say they saw virtually no organization by the mogul’s campaign last week when Republicans in all 93 Nebraska counties held local conventions. Those county conventions picked 800 delegates to May’s Nebraska state convention, where 33 delegates to the national convention in Cleveland will be selected,” Politico reports. “Because there was little resistance, many county conventions became Cruz pep rallies, according to interviews with party insiders and convention attendees. ”  “I didn’t see any Trump supporters,” said Washington County GOP member John Orr told Politico. “The only person there that had any kind of organization there was Cruz. No one showed up with Trump,” said former state legislator Tim Gay. Cruz has used his ground game in a number of states, most recently Colorado, to select delegates who support him. This will be beneficial if Trump fails to reach the 1, 237 delegate threshold at the Republican National Convention where the delegates become unbound on the second ballot and can vote for whichever candidate they favor. Cruz is expected to win the Nebraska winner take all primary on May 10.
