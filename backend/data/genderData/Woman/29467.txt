On Friday, Republican presidential candidate Ted Cruz‘s vice presidential pick, Carly Fiorina, criticized Donald Trump for calling former boxer and convicted rapist Mike Tyson a “tough guy,” after Tyson endorsed Trump.  Fiorina said, “By the way, if I could just add, I was actually interested to see an endorsement the other day by Mike Tyson, for Donald Trump, and Donald Trump saying, wow, all the tough guys are endorsing me. Sorry, I don’t consider a convicted rapist a tough guy. And I think it says a lot  …    that he is standing up and cheering for an endorsement by Mike Tyson. ” Follow Pam Key On Twitter @pamkeyNEN
