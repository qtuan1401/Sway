Wrigley  —   the company behind the popular Skittles brand  —   responded to Donald Trump Jr. ’s use of an analogy involving the candy to illustrate a point about the Syrian refugee crisis in a statement on Tuesday. [“Skittles are candy. Refugees are people. We don’t feel it’s an appropriate analogy,” Wrigley Americas vice president of corporate affairs Denise Young told the Hollywood Reporter in a statement.  “We will respectfully refrain from further commentary as anything we say could be misinterpreted as marketing,”Young added. Trump Jr. ’s tweet sent the left into a frenzy on Monday night and Tuesday. “If I had a bowl of skittles and I told you just three would kill you. Would you take a handful?” he wrote on Twitter. “That’s our Syrian refugee problem. ” This image says it all. Let’s end the politically correct agenda that doesn’t put America first. #trump2016 pic. twitter.   —   Donald Trump Jr. (@DonaldJTrumpJr) September 19, 2016,  As Breitbart’s Charlie Spiering previously reported, the tweet sent leftist social media users  —   including Hillary Clinton campaign workers  —   into paroxysms of outrage.
