She praised the supporters attending her fundraiser as “friends” who were in the “other basket. ” Clinton tried to signal empathy for those were “desperate for a change” pointing out that they felt that “the government has let them down, nobody cares about them, nobody worries about what happens to their lives and their futures. ” “They don’t buy everything he says, but he seems to hold out some hope that their lives will be different,” she said, calling for her supporters to “understand and empathize with as well. ” Clinton’s remarks drew comparisons to rhetoric from former failed Republican presidential nominee Mitt Romney, who pointed to the 47 percent of America that were just looking for a handout from the government. Romney’s remarks, made in private, were secretly recorded and made public, dooming his presidential campaign against President Barack Obama. But the former first lady made her remarks in front of reporters, as she allowed her campaign press pool access to the event. Clinton’s event was in New York City with Barbara Streisand, who performed a parody of the song “Send In The Clowns” which mocked Trump. Is he that rich?
