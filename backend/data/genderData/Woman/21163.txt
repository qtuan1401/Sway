A newly released Quinnipiac University poll shows Republicans Donald Trump and Ted Cruz effectively tied for first place in the state a month before the Iowa caucus, with Trump at 31 percent and Cruz at 29 percent, within the poll’s margin of error. [Sen. Marco Rubio is in third place with 15 percent.  According to an ABC report, “Chris Christie has 4 percent support in the new poll, while Jeb Bush and Mike Huckabee garner 3 percent. John Kasich and Rand Paul have 2 percent, while Rick Santorum and Carly Fiorina have 1 percent. ” The poll also puts Cruz ahead of Trump on favorability and character traits. Via Quinnipiac, Jeb Bush holds onto an increasingly familiar title  —   “biggest loser. ” The biggest loser today is former Florida Gov. Jeb Bush, who gets only 3 percent support from Republicans, while 26 percent say they “would definitely not support” him. “The Iowa Republican Caucuses are tight as a tick entering the final two weeks of the campaign. Voters like Sen. Ted Cruz better than Donald Trump and give him much higher scores for honesty, empathy, experience and for sharing their values,” said Peter A. Brown, assistant director of the Quinnipiac University Poll. “But they see the New York businessman as better able to handle some key issues. Trump is way ahead on handling the economy and terrorism. ” “The imbalance in perceived personal qualities may give Cruz a higher ceiling, a key metric entering the home stretch. Only 7 percent of Republicans say they could never vote for Cruz, while 26 percent say no way to Trump,” Brown added. The economy and jobs is the most important issue for 27 percent of Iowa likely Republican Caucus participants in deciding their vote, as 18 percent list terrorism 16 percent say foreign policy. Another 10 percent cite the federal deficit and 8 percent list immigration.
