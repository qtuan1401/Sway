(Want to get this briefing by email? Here’s the  .) Good evening. Here’s the latest. 1. One of the Islamic State’s most senior strategists, Abu Muhammad   was killed in the Syrian province of Aleppo. A founding member of ISIS, he was its chief propagandist and headed its efforts to instigate terror attacks in the West. _____ 2. The European Union’s antitrust enforcer ruled that huge tax breaks Ireland provided to Apple were illegal, ordering the country to collect about $14. 5 billion in back taxes. Apple described the record penalty as a “devastating blow” to the rule of law, and the U. S. despite its own frustrations with corporate schemes to avoid taxes, said it jeopardized “the important spirit of economic partnership between the U. S. and the E. U. ” _____ 3.   races in Florida and Arizona made Tuesday one of the summer’s biggest congressional primary days. Debbie Wasserman Schultz, above, who was forced to step down as chairwoman of the Democratic National Committee by an email leak, hung on to her South Florida House seat. Senator Marco Rubio of Florida was nominated by Republican voters for a second term, and John McCain fought off a Republican challenger for his Senate seat. _____ 4. Hillary Clinton and Donald Trump are preparing for the first presidential debate, due in less than four weeks, in tellingly different ways. Mrs. Clinton’s advisers are consulting Mr. Trump’s ghostwriter on “The Art of the Deal” and psychology experts, reviewing his past performances and looking for trigger points. Mr. Trump has had freewheeling sessions with his debate team, but not mock debates with a Clinton  . _____ 5. Brazil’s Senate could vote overnight on whether to convict President Dilma Rousseff of manipulating the federal budget to mask the extent of the country’s economic problems. “Don’t expect from me the obliging silence of cowards,” Ms. Rousseff said as she made a   rebuttal on Monday. _____ 6. Israel has been quietly legalizing tiny outposts established by settlers in the West Bank over the past two decades.   groups accuse the government of changing the map of the West Bank, now in its 50th year of Israeli occupation, and ruining any possibility of a   solution. “We see it as a very gradual move toward annexation,” said an Israeli opponent. _____ 7. Reader appreciations for Gene Wilder are rolling in by the hundreds in comments on our obituary and on our Facebook post. Our critic mused on the genius of the comic actor, who died Monday at the age of 83: glimmering eyes, diction “as crisp as a potato chip” and a barely suppressed lunacy. “His Willy Wonka spent that chocolate factory tour quietly on the verge of a nervous breakdown. ” _____ 8. Our magazine has the back story of Oliver Stone’s herculean efforts to make “Snowden,” the biopic of Edward Snowden opening Sept. 16. Mr. Stone became preoccupied with warding off government surveillance and schemed to secure Mr. Snowden’s appearance in the movie’s finale. That passage required nine takes. “Ed is used to answering questions on a level of intelligence,” Mr. Stone said. “But I was interested in the emotional, which is difficult for him. ” _____ 9. An organization that tracks extremist groups in the U. S. has declared one of them, White Lives Matter, a hate group. Established in opposition to the Black Lives Matter movement, the group argues that white Americans are being eradicated by immigration and intermarriage. “I wish Hitler were here alive and well today,” one of its founders wrote on a social networking site. _____ 10. Two years ago, turmoil swept over a New Hampshire prep school after a    student accused a senior of raping her. He was convicted of misdemeanor charges. Now, the unnamed student has come forward. In an interview with NBC, Chessy Prout described the difficulties she faced, including being shunned by fellow students, and offered support for other victims: “I want other people to feel empowered and just strong enough to be able to say: ‘I have the right to my body. I have the right to say no.’ ” _____ 11. Finally, this is a scientifically proven good dog. It’s one of a group that Hungarian researchers trained to enter a magnetic resonance imaging machine and lie quietly in a harness while their brain activity was recorded. The study found that dogs react not only to the tone of your voice, but also to the words themselves. So, as with humans, both meaning and emotional content matter. _____ Your Evening Briefing is posted at 6 p. m. Eastern. And don’t miss Your Morning Briefing, posted weekdays at 6 a. m.
