Trump said, “In our shared mission to make America great again, I support and endorse our speaker of the house, Paul Ryan. Paul Ryan, good, he’s a good man. He’s a good man and he’s a good guy. And we may disagree on a couple of things and mostly we agree and we’ll get it done and we’ll do a lot of wonderful things. He’s a good man. And while I’m at it, I hold in the highest esteem John McCain for his service to our country in uniform and in public office and I fully support and endorse his reelection. Very important. We’ll work together. I fully support and endorse Senator Kelly Ayotte of New Hampshire. A state I truly love, primarily because that was my first victory, but I love New Hampshire. I love New Hampshire. She is a rising star and will continue to represent the great people of New Hampshire so very well for a long, long time. Senator Kelly Ayotte, working hand in hand, we will grow our majority in the House and in the Senate. We need that. We’ve got to get things done. Arm in arm, we will rescue the nation from the   disaster. ”
