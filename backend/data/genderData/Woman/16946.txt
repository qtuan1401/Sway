Chicago Cubs owner Tom Ricketts responded earlier this week to a warning against his family issued by Republican presidential candidate Donald Trump. [“It’s a little surreal when Donald Trump threatens your mom,” CBS Chicago reports Ricketts saying. “The fact is whether it’s my mom or my dad on his Ending Spending stuff or my sister on marriage equality issues or my brothers and what they do or what we do with the team, we are pretty much are an open book. We stand up for what we believe in. We support the causes we think are important. That is what America should be. That is who we are. ”  Earlier this week, Trump issued what Ricketts regards as a   threat against his family. I hear the Rickets family, who own the Chicago Cubs, are secretly spending $’s against me. They better be careful, they have a lot to hide!  —   Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) February 22, 2016,  Family patriarch Joe Ricketts funds the conservative Ending Spending political action committee (PAC) and supports an   PAC called Our Principles. Son Tom insists that there’s nothing secretive about his family’s political giving. “My job is executing a plan to win the World Series,” Ricketts said of his Cubs,   favorites to win it all at many sorts books. “What other people in my family do is their day job. I support everything they do. It’s just not my focus. Once again, the stuff that happens on the political side is not my daily focus. ”
