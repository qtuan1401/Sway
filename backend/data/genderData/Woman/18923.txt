Saturday on MSNBC, Media Matters senior fellow Eric Boehlert blamed the conservative media for creating misogyny while discussing the media’s handling of the National Enquirer’s story that GOP presidential candidate Sen. Ted Cruz ( ) engaged in several extramarital affairs.  According to Boehlert, the conservative media objectified and attacked Michelle Obama, “demonized” Hillary Clinton and has now created this misogyny with Cruz’s wife, Heidi Cruz. ‘There’s a reason Republicans are objectifying women in this race in a really ugly and nasty way. The conservative media has been objectifying, attacking Michelle Obama for eight years. They have demonized Hillary Clinton for   years, so it’s kind of coming home to roost. Donald Trump does not play by any rules, and he’s going to throw this retweet. And now we’ve got the National Enquirer and Republican party and conservative media created this misogyny. ” Follow Trent Baker on Twitter @MagnifiTrent
