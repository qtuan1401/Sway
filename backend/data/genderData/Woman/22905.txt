[Here are 16 of Hollywood’s best and brightest who have pledged to move out of the United States in the event of a Trump win.    1. Barbra Streisand, “I can’t believe it. I’m either coming to your country if you’ll let me in, or Canada,” the singer told 60 Minutes in an interview in August. Streisand has been a vocal supporter of Clinton’s candidacy, and appeared at a   fundraiser for the candidate in New York City earlier this year. 2. Bryan Cranston, “I would definitely move.

Miley Cyrus, The young pop star said she would “move out da country” if Trump, whom she called a “f*cking nightmare” were to win the election. 4. Lena Dunham,  The Girls star said there is a “100 percent chance” she will pick up and move to Canada if Trump prevails on Election Day. “I love Canada. I think that it’s a great place, and there’s an area in Vancouver that I find beautiful and appealing, and I can conduct business from there,” the actress and Clinton surrogate said. 5. Amy Schumer, The comedian and Trainwreck actress said Spain would be her destination of choice if Trump wins the presidency. “My act will change because I will need to learn to speak Spanish,” Schumer said in an appearance on the BBC’s Newsnight in September. “Because I will move to Spain or somewhere. It’s beyond my comprehension if Trump won. It’s just too crazy. ” 6. Jon Stewart, The former Daily Show funnyman may want to connect with billionaire space pioneer Elon Musk if Trump wins he told People magazine last year that he would consider “getting in a rocket and going to another planet, because clearly this planet’s gone bonkers. ” 7.

Chelsea Handler, The comedian and   host said she had already made a contingency plan in the event of a Trump win. “I did buy a house in another country just in case,” Handler said in an interview on ABC’s Live with Kelly and Michael in May. “So all these people that threaten to leave the country and then don’t  —   I actually will leave that country. ” 9.

That’s not the president I want. Find a way to make stuff work. ” “Maybe it’s time for me to move, you know. I can afford to go,” she added. 11. Neve Campbell, The Scream and House of Cards actress said she would move back to her native Canada if Trump wins the election. “They see someone off the cuff and broad, and they think ‘ok, that’s the voice we need, just someone honest,’” Campbell told the Huffington Post of the motivation behind the Republican candidate’s support. “But his honesty is terrifying. ” 12.   Key, The Key and Peele star also said he’d flee north to Canada in the event of a Trump presidency. “It’s like, 10 minutes from Detroit,” the comedian told TMZ in January. “That’s where I’m from my mom lives there. It’d make her happy too. ” 13. George Lopez, “If he wins, he won’t have to worry about immigration. We’ll all go back,” the Latino comedian and TV star told TMZ shortly after Trump announced his candidacy in 2015. 14.

Al Sharpton, The civil rights activist told attendees at a Center for American Progress event in February that he would be looking for flight reservations if Clinton did not triumph on Election Day. “I’m also reserving my ticket to get out of here if he wins.
