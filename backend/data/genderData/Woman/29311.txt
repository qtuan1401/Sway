He will visit Flint, Michigan and then head to Ohio, where a new Bloomberg poll finds him leading by five points, for a rally.

He’s talking about rebuilding the country’s infrastructure. Trump promises to take care of our miners and steel workers. Trump says “American hands” will rebuild our nation and American energy will power our nation. He says we will put new American steel into the spine of our country. He says he will fight for every neglected part of our nation and to bring everyone together as “one American people. ” He says there is no greater threat to democracy than when a politician puts her office up for sale. He says Clinton’s tenure as State Department was “one of historic failure” because “everything went wrong” around the world. 7:25: Trump pushes for   trade policies and slams Clinton for her support for TPP.

He wonders why Obama isn’t working instead of campaigning for “Crooked Hillary. ” 7:07: Trump says Flint’s water crisis represents failure at every level of government. “Gross incompetence,” he says. “It’s tragic and it’s heartbreaking and it should never happen in the United States of America. This is the catastrophe that does happen when we build up other countries instead of our own  …     It’s America First now, folks. ” Crowd chants “  !   !” 7:05: Trump says the people in the United States are “ready for change” and are ready to discard a political establishment that look down upon   people. He says the choice is between an arrogant ruling class vs. the hopes and dreams of average Americans.

Trump says he’s the messenger and his is the message of “competence” and “jobs, jobs, jobs” and “fixing our military” and “taking care of our great vets” who are “treated worse than illegal immigrants. ” He says it’s a message of saving our Second Amendment, which is “totally under siege. ” And, Trump says, it’s a message of “Supreme Court Justices. ” 7:03: In Scranton: Woman near me in press riser yells, ”Up hers!” https:  .   —   Elizabeth Landers (@ElizLanders) September 14, 2016,  . @mike_pence reference to Barbara Streisand, when talking about @HillaryClinton fundraiser, draws boos at Scranton rally.  —   Scott Bauer (@sbauerAP) September 14, 2016,  7:02: Trump tells the crowd he just visited the football Hall of Fame.

Dr. Lisa Bardack, Clinton’s personal doctor and the chair of Internal Medicine at CareMount Medical in Mount Kisco, New York, said she evaluated Clinton multiple times in the last week  —   including Wednesday  —   and found that the Democratic nominee had a small right   pneumonia.

This is emblematic of the corrupt    culture Hillary Clinton and those in her orbit bring to the table, where it so pervasive it is actually uncontroversial to those involved. This is why a special prosecutor needs to be appointed to independently investigate the growing evidence of corruption between the Clinton Foundation and the State Department while Hillary Clinton was serving as secretary of state. ” 1:58: Trump supporters in Flint: Trump supporters waiting for Donald Trump to arrive in Flint. pic. twitter.   —   SharisseReports (@SharisseReports) September 14, 2016,      Protesters:  Flint, Michigan    across the street of the Flint Water Plant.

Shalala just responded by saying Mitchell knows the people in Clinton world before adding, “I can’t answer the question specifically. They’ve always hired very strong people who have told them the truth. ” 1:00: In an interview with Andrea Mitchell, Clinton Foundation President Donna Shalala said the Clinton foundation can’t go out of business because of the library. She said that some programmatic parts would be spun off into separate charities. Then the whoopers started. She claimed there is no “secrecy as far as this foundation is concerned. ” She claimed “we disclose all of our donors” and the foundation was “totally transparent. ” [FLASHBACK: CLINTON FOUNDATION AMENDS TAX RETURNS AND FAILED TO DISCLOSE $225 MILLION IN FOREIGN DONATIONS.] Mitchell asked a “true or false” question about whether Trump is correct in characterizing the foundation as having engaged in    politics. Shalala gave a   answer about how it is not unusual to have meetings with people like Muhammad Yunus and Melinda Gates. She said she didn’t see “any evidence that there were policy decisions” made because of meetings that donors to the Clinton Foundation received after conceding that there “phone calls made to get appointments for people,” which Shalala casually dismissed as “courtesy appointments. ” Mitchell hardly challenged her. Shall insisted that she didn’t find the preferential treatment for donors and meetings “unusual. ” “We have to be careful that it is not linked to policy decisions,” she said.
