Donald Trump’s campaign is alleging that the FBI colluded with the Department of State on changing the classification of Hillary Clinton’s emails, which were being investigated due to Clinton’s use of a personal, private email server as secretary of state. [Unbelievable. https:  .   —   Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) October 17, 2016,   “These FBI documents provide undeniable proof that Hillary Clinton colluded with the FBI, DOJ and State Department to cover up criminal activity at the highest levels,” alleges Trump adviser Lt. Gen. Michael Flynn in a press release on Monday, adding: Hillary Clinton has recklessly put our national security at extreme risk.

Flynn’s statement comes after news broke that FBI officials allegedly discussed a quid pro quo deal in return for changing email classification with the Department of State. The Washington Examiner reports: FBI notes released Monday show that Patrick Kennedy, State’s undersecretary for management, pressured the FBI to change the classified markings on an email that had been upgraded to “secret. ” One section of the notes indicates that Kennedy wanted a classification change to “B9,” and said that change would allow him to “archive the document in the basement of DOS never to be seen again. ” The notes then indicate that another unnamed official said he would “look into the   matter if KENNEDY would provide authority concerning the FBI’s request to increase its personnel in Iraq. ” The FBI issued a statement, saying the change of classification never occurred and that a quid pro quo deal never took place.
