SANTA MONICA, California  —   Former Mexican president Vicente Fox told Breitbart News this week that he envisions the United States as a mother to the world, and that he supports Hillary Clinton rather than Donald Trump. [“Love is something that  —   in this life, nothing can be better than that. I envision the presidency of the United States to be like a good [loving] and caring mother, a real lady,” Fox told Breitbart News during an exclusive interview at the J. W. Marriott in Santa Monica, California on Wednesday. “I see the presidential seat of the United States also with an ideal lady, with a lady that really knows how to use power within the limits of compassionate leadership. ”  Breitbart News then asked if that meant he supports Hillary Clinton. “After following the intense, very competitive, very conflicted sometimes for months, yes,” Fox responded, “I think that seat of power, that seat that influences and leads the whole of the world, should have somebody that [has] the qualifications, the characteristics, that goes along with the Founding Fathers’ dream. ” “The Founding Fathers dream is not what Trump is proposing. The Republican Party dream is not what they’re proposing,” he said, saying a Republican is never against trade, adding about Trump, “And this guy wants to enclose this great nation in four walls. ” Fox repeated his support for Hillary Clinton later on Talk Radio 1210 WPHT. “I am always promoting compassionate leadership and that’s what I see in Hillary Clinton. She is a compassionate leader. She is a loving, tending, and caring mother. In her job in politics, she also is an honorable lady. You can be strong and be aggressive, but you’re going to offend people like he has done. ”
