A Woodbridge Wealth survey questioning financial advisors found that 83 percent believe Donald Trump would foster   growth and build a stable economy, while only six percent said Hillary Clinton would be a better choice. [“Regardless of the election’s outcome, financial advisors who responded to our survey made themselves abundantly clear as to who they believe is   to set the country on a path to economic vitality,” stated President and CEO of Woodbridge Group of Companies Bob Shapiro in a press release. “Throughout the survey, we see the same economic themes repeated over and over again: job one for the new Administration has to be economic fixes. ”  The survey found that financial advisors want the candidates to discuss the Fiduciary Rule,   and Social Security.   percent of the respondents said that changing corporate tax rates would have a positive impact on the economy. Results also suggest they want the new president to create jobs, curb inflation, and address national security issues as well as immigration.
