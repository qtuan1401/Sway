Donald Trump is right: the press is so dishonest. CNN used a truncated video clip of my interview with Stefan Molyneux to imply I was advocating violence. [Here is what I said about the Stop the Steal March Cleveland, as reported by Breitbart (emphasis added to note the sentence CNN excluded):  “We’re going to have protests, demonstrations. We will disclose the hotels and the room numbers of those delegates who are directly involved in the steal,” Stone stated in a radio interview. “If you’re from Pennsylvania, we’ll tell you who the culprits are,” Stone threatened. “We urge you to visit their hotel and find them. You have a right to discuss this, if you voted in the Pennsylvania primary, for example, and your votes are being disallowed. ” DISCUSS! Where is the threat of violence? We the people who VOTED for these delegates have a RIGHT to engage them. The GOP is going to lose MILLIONS of new voters, disillusioned Democrats and Independents, if this nomination is stolen from Donald Trump. Only Trump can win. We have a right to make our case. The votes of millions of voters would be ignored and the nomination stolen with trickery. Join me for the Stop the Steal Rally on July  .
