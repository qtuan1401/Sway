Wednesday on CNN’s “New Day,” former Mexican President Vicente Fox said Republican presidential nominee Donald Trump was “not welcome to Mexico. ”  Fox said, “First of all, let me tell you, he is not welcome to Mexico. By 130 million people, we don’t like him, we don’t want him, we reject his message. I don’t understand why President Peña has offered this opportunity. I think it’s nothing more than a political stunt. Trump is using Mexico, he’s using President Peña to boost his sinking poll numbers. I think the President Peña is taking an enormous political risk by hosting Trump. If he’s gone soft on Trump, it will hurt him greatly. He will even be considered like a traitor because we don’t accept to be offended like we just heard and that should not happen  —   he comes here with a smile on his face. I think this is a big mistake on part of President Peña. ” Follow Pam Key on Twitter @pamkeyNEN
