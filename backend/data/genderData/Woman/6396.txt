(Want to get this briefing by email? Here’s the  .) Good evening. Here’s the latest. 1. A Times investigation reveals how Russia aimed the perfect weapon at the U. S. presidential election: cyberattacks honed in elections elsewhere. Intelligence officials believe an operation to collect information evolved into an effort to harm one candidate, Hillary Clinton, and tip the election to her opponent, Donald J. Trump. Above, the Democratic National Convention’s hacked server on a table in the organization’s basement, next to a reminder of a past breach: a filing cabinet jimmied in the Watergate burglary of its offices in 1972. _____  2. Mr. Trump is lining up veteran members of the Republican foreign policy establishment to endorse his choice for secretary of state, Rex Tillerson, above. Mr. Tillerson, the Exxon Mobil chief executive, faces sharp scrutiny over his ties to President Vladimir V. Putin and the billions of dollars his company has at stake over United States sanctions against Russia. Mr. Trump also picked Rick Perry, the former Texas governor, to oversee the country’s aging nuclear arsenal as head of the Energy Department  —   an agency Mr. Perry has suggested abolishing while forgetting its name. Here’s the latest on the transition. _____ 3. Russia, Turkey and Syrian rebel groups reached an agreement for rebels to leave their last pockets of territory in the ravaged city of Aleppo. Evacuations were expected to begin shortly, leaving the city fully in the hands of government forces, a definitive victory. But there was confusion over whether the deal would assure safe passage for civilians, scores of whom have been shot in the streets, according to the U. N. Above, the remains of the Umayyad Mosque. _____ 4. Looking ahead: The Federal Reserve meets Wednesday amid near certainty that it will raise its benchmark interest rate. Our analyst cautions that Mr. Trump’s stimulus plan may overheat the economy and prompt a rapid series of rate increases. As part of his quest to create jobs, Mr. Trump plans to meet with tech leaders, including Elon Musk of Tesla, above, Timothy D. Cook of Apple and Jeff Bezos of Amazon. _____ 5. The latest contract between Major League Baseball and the players’ union bans a hazing ritual inflicted on rookies: forcing them to dress in drag, as Hooters waitresses or cheerleaders, for instance. The contract bars offensive costumes of any kind or requiring rookies to consume alcohol. Making them fetch coffee or go on snack runs will still be permitted. _____ 6. Fracking can contaminate drinking water, an Environmental Protection Agency study concluded, reversing an earlier finding. The comprehensive report comes as the incoming Trump administration plans to expand fracking and to install an opponent of regulation as the E. P. A. head. _____ 7. Meet Waymo.  Google’s parent company spun off its   car project into its own company, a major step toward a commercial fleet. In another potential transportation milestone, federal highway regulators proposed rules that would require all cars and trucks to broadcast data to one another about their speed, location and direction in order to avert accidents. _____ 8. A child sex abuse scandal is exploding across British soccer. Since Andrew Woodward became the first professional player in Britain to go public with his account of repeated rapes by a childhood coach, at least 20 former players have come forward. One, above left, was comforted by Mr. Woodward. The police are investigating the possibility of hundreds of victims at 98 soccer clubs, from the amateur ranks to the Premier League. _____ 9. Plan ahead. “Rogue One: A Star Wars Story” opens nationwide on Friday, with projections of one of the biggest December debuts. No spoilers in the ordinary sense here, but our reviewer’s take is unforgiving  —   the film’s pleasures are “meager and disposable. ” Intent on going? There are some good reviews out there too. _____ 10. One of our   articles today looks at the future of political comedy, and how   Al Franken, the onetime “Saturday Night Live” star turned Democratic senator, is confronting the incoming administration. “Donald Trump never laughs,” he said. _____ 11. Finally, the U. N. ended its   designation of a cartoon superhero as its ambassador for women and girls. A spokesman said that Wonder Woman’s   tenure was not unusual, noting the brief duration of other honorary ambassadorships, including the single day the “Angry Birds” character Red presided on climate issues. _____ Photographs may appear out of order for some readers.
