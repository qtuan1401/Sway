Friday on “CBS This Morning,” correspondent Julianna Goldman reported on the ongoing back and forth between presumptive Republican presidential nominee Donald Trump and Democratic presidential   Hillary Clinton.  But also segment segment, Goldman discussed Trump making Hillary Clinton’s husband a target, former President Bill Clinton, which she said “carries a great risk. ” “Spouses are typically considered off limits, but a former president is not a typical spouse,” Goldman said. “He’s been a constant presence on the campaign trail, making him a natural target for Trump, but one that carries great risk. Among women, Bill Clinton’s favorability ratings are higher than the presumptive Republican nominee’s and his own wife’s. The former president also has to be careful. ” (  Newsbusters) Follow Jeff Poor on Twitter @jeff_poor
