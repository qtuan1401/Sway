.@SenateMajLdr on Gorsuch’s concerns over Trump’s attacks on the judiciary: I happen to agree with what Gorsuch said https:  .  During an interview aired on Wednesday’s broadcast of MSNBC’s “Morning Joe,” Senate Majority Leader Senator Mitch McConnell ( ) said that whether or not he needs to use the nuclear option to confirm Judge Neil Gorsuch to the Supreme Court “will depend on the Democrats. ”  When asked if he would have to use the nuclear option to get Gorsuch confirmed, McConnell answered, “That will depend on the Democrats. ” He’ll be confirmed. the issue for your audience, the issue you’re raising is, will we have to get cloture, in other words, 60 votes to advance the nomination? Senator [Jeff] Merkley ( ) announced we were going have to do that before he even knew who the nominee was. So, my assumption is, we’ll have to get 60 votes. ” McConnell further vowed that Gorsuch will get 60 votes, and that “In any event, Gorsuch is going to be confirmed. ” McConnell also praised Gorsuch, and stated that he agrees with Gorsuch’s concerns over President Trump’s “  judge” denunciation of a ruling against his immigration executive order.
