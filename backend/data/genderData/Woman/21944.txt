After three days and hundreds of submissions, it’s time to announce the winners of the #FabulousWall contest. [For those unhappy souls who missed my first announcement, I recently gave you all the opportunity to win one of Breitbart’s limited edition “Border Wall Construction Co”   modelled by yours truly and the Queen of Conservative Media, Ann Coulter, earlier in the week.  To win this stunning, stylish prize, all you had to do was decorate a picture of me standing in front of the Wall. It was a tremendously difficult task, as any picture featuring me is almost impossible to improve upon. But, with the promise of fabulous Breitbart swag in your minds and a love of Daddy’s America in your hearts, hundreds of you submitted your entries. And now it’s time for the difficult task of selecting the winners. But first, here are seventeen honourable mentions that caught my eye  …     #FabulousWall pic. twitter.   —   Geir Offenberg (@FriarFire) July 12, 2016,  I was sorely tempted to put this entry, from @FriarFire, in the top three. It perfectly captures the moment of my creation. #FabulousWall for @Nero and @BreitbartNews Enjoy! pic. twitter.   —   Mike Young, Esq.

(@BasedGodEmperor) July 13, 2016,  If I had a heart, @BasedGodEmperor’s picture would make me well up with tears of patriotic joy. “He came here legally” is a stroke of genius.

In the books, you have to say one word in Elvish in order to pass through the gates of Moria. At Trump’s wall, that won’t be good enough: you’ll have to pass an entire English exam. @Nero No Vacancy #FabulousWall pic. twitter.   —   Greg Davis (@fttmb) July 12, 2016,  NO VACANCY. #FabulousWall @Nero needs to see this so I can feel good about how I just spent my night.  pic. twitter.   —   Logan Saint (@iTopDog_) July 13, 2016,  The picture is good, but more importantly, @iTopDog is cute. @Nero I just had to make this one, since no one else did  …     #FabulousWall #MAGA @KassyDillon @IamQueenAri pic. twitter.   —   Todd Judges (@ToddJudges) July 13, 2016,  Mmmmm. Here is @Nero finishing up the wall around @SpeakerRyan’s house. #FabulousWall pic. twitter.   —   Naes (@NaesRetro) July 13, 2016,  Very good, @NaesRetro. Very good indeed. #FabulousWall @Nero to scale or should it be 10 feet higher? pic. twitter.   —   Mister Atherton (@MisterAtherton) July 13, 2016,  10 MILES HIGHER! @nero ”Here, there be monsters  …    ”  —   The obvious jokes were already taken so I went a different route! #FabulousWall pic. twitter.   —   Todd Judges (@ToddJudges) July 12, 2016,  Nightmare fuel! Okay, everybody go home, I built the most #FabulousWall ever @Nero pic. twitter.   —   Alex Spector (@SpectorAlex) July 13, 2016,  This man actually went into Minecraft to build his very own Fagwall. This is the kind of dedication I inspire. @oAntixo: @Nero #FabulousWall #Trump2016pic. twitter.   —   oAntixo (@oAntixo) July 13, 2016,  Dangerous Daddy and Dangerous Faggy, side by side.

After much deliberation, and agony at all the hearts I have to break, it’s time to whittle down the contest to just two runners up, and one winner. Mirror, mirror on the wall, who is the most fabulous photoshopper of them all  …    ? @BreitbartNews You must be this tall to build this wall. #fabulouswall #miloyiannopoulosa #benshapiro #trump2016 pic. twitter.   —   gregory alan elliott (@greg_a_elliott) July 12, 2016,  Clearly, this man was born for Twitter. It’s going to take a lot more than the Canadian justice system to keep him away! @Nero not sure why but it would be awesome to see #fabulouswall pic. twitter.   —   Brian Fencl (@fenclstudio) July 13, 2016,  This image would be perfect, if it weren’t for two things. One  —   there should be a much larger bulge in Daddy’s spandex. Two  —   he would NEVER let me be on top, and I wouldn’t want that either! Other than that it’s FABULOUS. @nero #fabulouswall #MAGA pic. twitter.   —   4THand100 (@4thand100) July 13, 2016,  This is one of the most mesmerizing GIFs I’ve ever seen. I’ve been watching it on loop for half an hour. The picture leaves more questions than it answers. Was there a   as the horde of illegal aliens ran into the wall? Did people die? How many times can I press the button before the wall stops getting higher? To all the contest entrants, we salute you and wish we could send you all free shirts.
