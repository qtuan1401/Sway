Donald Trump attacked Hillary Clinton’s credentials in leading the gay community after she refused to condemn radical Islamic terrorism in the aftermath of the Orlando gay nightclub shooting. [“Hillary Clinton can never claim to be a friend of the gay community as long as she continues to support immigration policies that bring Islamic extremists to our country who suppress women, gays and anyone who doesn’t share their views,” Trump said in his speech Monday in Manchester, New Hampshire.  “She can’t have it both ways. She can’t claim to be supportive of these communities while trying to increase the number of people coming in who want to oppress them. ” “How does this kind of immigration make our life better? How does this kind of immigration make our country better? ,” Trump said. “Why does Hillary Clinton want to bring people here —  in vast numbers —  who reject our values?” “Ask yourself, who is really the friend of women and the LGBT community, Donald Trump with his actions, or Hillary Clinton with her words? Clinton wants to allow Radical Islamic terrorists to pour into our country —  they enslave women, and murder gays,” Trump added. Trump supporter Newt Gingrich also appealed to the gay and lesbian community in his interview on Breitbart News Sunday on   Channel 125. “It’s totally utterly dishonest and misleading,” Gingrich said of President Obama’s press conference Sunday, noting that Obama —   like Clinton —  refused to condemn “radical Islamic terrorism” by name. “This is an act of war. This is an act committed by a dedicated Islamic supremacist. In the world of an Islamic supremacist, killing gays is totally legitimate. And this is part of what the gay community has to come to grips with. These people are their mortal enemies. Literally mortal. Will kill them. ”
