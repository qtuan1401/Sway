Hollywood and other media progressives reacted to the death of U. S. Supreme Court Justice Antonin Scalia on Saturday with a mixture of sarcasm and jubilation. [Scalia, who was appointed to the Supreme Court in 1986 by President Ronald Reagan, was considered to be one of the most conservative constitutionalists on the court. He died of apparent natural causes Saturday while visiting a luxury resort in west Texas after a day of quail hunting.  While there were a number of leftwing celebrities who shared their condolences, others responded with the kind of vitriol you would expect from liberal Hollywood. Star Jones: The #GOP is vowing not to ”permit”  #POTUS #OBAMA to do his job after #Scalia’s death. Might as well call him boy. &gt  https:  .   —   Star Jones (@StarJonesEsq) February 14, 2016,  Jeffrey Wright, You know  —   as per Article II, Section 2 of that Constitution thing.
