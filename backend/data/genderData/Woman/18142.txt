Thursday night on Newsmax TV’s “Newsmax Prime” former White House chief of staff under President George H. W. Bush and former Gov. John Sununu ( ) said Republican presidential candidate Donald Trump and his surrogates are ” trying to denigrate the Republican Party” in their effort to “bully,” the delegates at the GOP convention in July.  Sununu said, “You got to get to 1, 237. You have to convince the majority of the delegates that you ought to be the nominee that we send forward to beat Hillary Clinton. This game now that the Trump people are playing, trying to shift the goal line, it’s ridiculous. They’re trying to claim they didn’t understand the rules. They’re trying to claim that the process is rigged. They’re trying to denigrate the Republican Party as their effort to bully, if you will, the delegates into doing something that most of the delegates right now are still evaluating. ” He added, “This has a long way to go, and it’s not any different than the rule structure that we’ve dealt with over the years. ” Follow Pam Key on Twitter @pamkeyNEN
