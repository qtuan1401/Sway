Democratic presidential nominee Hillary Clinton says she’s frustrated by what she suggests is a media double standard between her and Donald Trump. [Clinton held a press conference at an airport on Thursday, where two reporters who cover her asked whether she thinks there is a “double standard” that she was facing from the media.  “I don’t understand the reasons for it,” she said. “I find it frustrating, but its just part of the landscape that we live in and we just keep forging ahead. ” Clinton praised members of the media who questioned their colleagues, suggesting that they were too easy on Trump. “I have been somewhat heartened by the number of articles recently pointing out the quite disparate treatment of Trump and his campaign compared to ours,” she said. “Do you think that you’re treated differently in this race because you’re a woman?” another reporter asked. Clinton responded that she would let journalists tackle the question, predicting that she would be the topic of historical study long after the election. “I’m going to let all of you ponder that last question,” she said. “I think there will be a lot of Ph. D. theses and popular journalism writing on that subject for years to come. ” Clinton noted that Trump said so many outrageous things that it might be hard for journalists to know where to begin criticizing him. “I know that’s part of the coverage and I know that it may be difficult to feel that you know exactly how to respond to some of his behavior,” he said. She also claimed that she didn’t want any “special treatment” because she was the first woman nominee of a major party to run for president. “I’m not asking for any special treatment,” she said. “I know the road that I’m on. I’ve been on it for 25 years, and I just get up every day and keep moving forward. ”
