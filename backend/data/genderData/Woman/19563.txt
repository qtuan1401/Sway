Instead, Richards switched the focus back to Hillary Clinton: But to me, [the] reason we’re endorsing her today —  the reason why hundreds of people across this country got together —  is because Hillary Clinton is a longstanding champion of women’s health and women’s rights and not just [P]lanned [P]arenthood: equal pay, access to birth control, access to safe and legal abortion. Planned Parenthood’s historic endorsement of a candidate in a primary comes as the organization is under congressional investigation by several committees for possible criminal activity as seen in a series of videos exposing the abortion business’ apparent practices of selling the body parts of aborted babies and altering the position of babies during abortions to harvest the most intact organs.
