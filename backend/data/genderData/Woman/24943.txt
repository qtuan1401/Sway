Monday on CNN’s “New Day,” conservative radio talk show host Glenn Beck said Republican presidential candidate Donald Trump is a “very dangerous man. ”  Beck said, “What I have warned about for so long  —   people only focus when I was at Fox, only focused on what I was saying about Barack Obama  —   but when I was at CNN, I was saying much of the same stuff about George W. Bush. Nobody paid attention. When I was at Fox, I warned Democrats, please understand if you let the balance of power go out of whack the next guy who can get in could be calling himself a Republican and he will take that same power and use it at the same level or expand it. That is a very bad thing. We need a Constitutional restraint on the executive branch. And Donald Trump I believe is a very dangerous man. If you listen to things he said this weekend   …     ‘I could go on to Fifth Avenue and shoot people and wouldn’t lose a vote.’ He has joked about killing reporters and not killing reporters like Putin does. He is a very dangerous man. Follow Pam Key on Twitter @pamkeyNEN
