NEW YORK (Reuters)  —   Republican presidential nominee Donald Trump has pulled nearly even with Democratic rival Hillary Clinton for the first time since May, according to a   poll taken over the course of the Republican National Convention in Cleveland this week.  The July   national online poll found that 41 percent of likely voters supported Clinton, while 38 percent supported Trump. Given the poll’s credibility interval of about 4 percentage points, Trump and Clinton should be considered to be about even in the race. Just before Republicans opened the convention on Monday, Trump had trailed Clinton by nearly 10 percentage points in the poll. The New York    formally accepted the Republican nomination for the Nov. 8 presidential election during a convention at which the party at times struggled to show unity.
