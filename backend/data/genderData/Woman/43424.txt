’  ’ ’   President Donald Trump spoke by phone on Friday to Mexican   President Enrique Pena  Trump confirmed in a   joint press conference with British Prime Minister Theresa May ’ ’  ’ ’  ’ ’   Mexico released a readout of Trump’’s call with Nieto on Friday,   which claims that the presidents ”agreed at this point not to   speak publicly” about the wall. ’ ’   ”Both presidents acknowledged their clear and very public   differences in position on this sensitive issue,” the readout   said,” and agreed to resolve those differences as part of a   comprehensive discussion of all aspects of the bilateral   relationship.” ’ ’’ ’   The White House’’ readout of the call made no mention of an   agreement not to discuss the wall publicly, noting instead that   the leaders ”have agreed to work these differences out as part of   a comprehensive discussion” and ”instructed their teams to   continue the dialogue to strengthen this important strategic and   economic relationship.” ’ ’  ’ ’   The war of words began early on Thursday, when  :   ”The U. S. has a 60 billion dollar trade deficit with Mexico. It   has been a   deal from the beginning of NAFTA with   massive numbers of jobs and companies lost. If Mexico is   unwilling to pay for the badly needed wall, then it would be   better to cancel the upcoming meeting.” ’ ’   Peña Nieto : ”This morning we have informed the White   House that I will not attend the meeting scheduled for next   Tuesday with the @POTUS.” The Mexican president has repeatedly   said Mexico would not pay for the border wall. ’ ’   Trump hit back early Friday, apparently before he and Nieto spoke   by phone.  ’ ’  ’
