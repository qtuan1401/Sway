Kurt Eichenwald, a senior writer for Newsweek, took to Twitter Friday and wished that Republicans who voted for the American Health Care Act see a family member suffer from a serious illness, lose their health insurance, and die. [“As one   preexisting condition: I hope every GOPr who voted 4 Trumpcare sees a family member get a long term condition, lose insurance,  die,” Eichenwald said in a series of tweets that have since been deleted.  After being confronted by Twitter users, Eichenwald doubled down and insisted that Republican lawmakers’ family members be “tortured. ” “Nobody tell me how to feel knowing if I lose my insurance, I’m dead. I want the GOPrs who support this to feel the pain in their own families,” Eichenwald tweeted. “Because I want them to be tortured. GOPr only gain empathy when they are touched by the consequences, never before,” he continued. Eichenwald issued a statement to the Daily Caller over his remarks hoping for the death of Republican lawmakers’ families: Asked @kurteichenwald for comment on his tweets wishing death upon Republicans’ family members.
