Friday on ABC’s “The View,” while discussing a Harvard University forum Thursday where top members of both the Donald Trump and Hillary Clinton presidential campaigns got into heated exchanges,   Joy Behar explained that Clinton supporters are being sore losers, saying, “We’re sore losers because it wasn’t won legitimately, as far as I’m concerned. ”  Behar said, “Yes, we’re sore losers, because a lot of the reason he won is based on the racism, the Russian hacking, lies, continuous lying that went on, and the intrusion of the FBI at the last minute there. All of that seems to have basically distorted the whole election. So, yeah, we’re sore losers because it wasn’t won legitimately, as far as I’m concerned. ” Follow Pam Key on Twitter @pamkeyNEN
