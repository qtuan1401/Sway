No, I’’m not quitting this race. I   have tremendous support.” ’ ”   Despite  asking Trump to   leave the race, Trump insists that he’s also hearing people tell   him to stay in. ” ’   ”People are calling and saying, ’’Don’’t even think about doing   anything else but running,’’” he told Costa. ”You have to see   what’’s going on.
