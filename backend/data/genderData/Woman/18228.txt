GOP frontrunner Donald Trump joined Breitbart News Daily on SiriusXM Wednesday, responding to Charles Koch’s recent statements about Trump. [“I don’t say anything to him,” Trump said responding to Koch. “I’ve always liked the Kochs. They’re members of my club in Palm Beach. ”  “What he says bears no relationship on what I do or say. I don’t need his money. I got my own money,” Trump said, suggesting other politicians who take Koch’s donations are “puppets. ” “I disagree with them 100 percent on some of the things,” he added. “He actually went so far as to say he might back Hillary Clinton. ” “He made some statements that were not very good for the Republican Party and that’s too bad,” Trump said of Koch recently suggesting he might support Clinton instead of the GOP nominee. “But, again, you have a lot of people that need him, and I don’t need him at all,” the billionaire said. “One of the reasons he wouldn’t like me is because I don’t need him, and I won’t do what he tells me to do, because I couldn’t care less. ” “I’m going to do what’s right for the American people,” Trump said.  “And he can have his puppets, and they’re all over the place. ” Breitbart News Daily airs on SiriusXM Patriot 125 weekdays from 6 a. m. to 9 a. m.
