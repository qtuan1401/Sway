Ann Coulter called Ted Cruz and Fox News “traitors” for blaming Donald Trump for dangerous protesters shutting down a   rally in Chicago, blistering Trump’s primary rival on Twitter. [Fox News  Cruz are American traitors, in league with the liberal establishment. Silent majority must face fire from a unified oligarchy.  —   Ann Coulter (@AnnCoulter) March 12, 2016,   We win or lose with Trump and only Trump.  —   Ann Coulter (@AnnCoulter) March 12, 2016,  Cruz suggested Trump’s campaign “bears responsibility” for violent protesters threatening Trump and his supporters, as social media revealed images of a policeman bleeding from his head and anecdotes of peaceful attendees terrorized by agitators. As reported by Breitbart’s Katie McHugh, this statement angered many Cruz supporters: “I think a campaign bears responsibility for creating an environment, when the candidate urges supporters to engage in physical violence  —   to punch people in the face. The predictable consequence of that is that it escalates and today is unlikely to be the last such instance. We earlier today in St. Louis over thirty arrested. That’s not how our politics should occur,” Cruz said Friday. “You know, the City of Chicago in 1968 saw some ugly days when politics descended into hatred and incivility and even violence and it is my hope that in 2016 that we can appeal to our better angels and avoid going down that road once again. ” Coulter said Cruz’s statement to Fox was evidence of a “unified oligarchy,” especially resonant after reports of a secret confab between elites from the Republican establishment and the tech world gathering to create an   electoral strategy just days before the Chicago mayhem.
