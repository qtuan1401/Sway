Democratic presidential nominee Hillary Clinton warns Americans that Russian president Vladimir Putin is trying to hack the United States presidential election to help Donald Trump win. [Clinton was asked about reports suggesting that Russian hackers were trying to hack into voter information in the United States during an interview with ABC’s David Muir.  She said that was “there is no doubt in my mind” that “there is something going on” with Putin, suggesting that Russia would try to hack the election. “Every American should be concerned about Russia doing anything to try to tilt and influence our election,” she said. Clinton cited American intelligence as proof that Russians were behind the DNC email hack. “Voters should be concerned about this,” she said. She also theorized that Putin basically admitted that he was trying to influence the election by hacking into American networks. “What I found very troubling but also revealing is when Putin was specifically asked that, he didn’t deny it,” Clinton said. “He said, well it’s good the information got out. Which, having dealt with Putin, I took as an admission. ” However, Putin did deny that Russia’s government was responsible for the DNC hack. “I don’t know anything about it, and on a state level Russia has never done this,” Putin said in an interview with Bloomberg News. “Listen, does it even matter who hacked this data?” Putin continued during the interview. “The important thing is the content that was given to the public. ” But Clinton assured Americans that Putin preferred Donald Trump to be the next president of the United States, citing “close relationships” with people in Trump’s circle, “all the way up to Putin himself. ”
