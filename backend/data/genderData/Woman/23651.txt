Ted Cruz has a theory as to why everyone is warming up to Donald Trump: Trump will make deals in Washington D. C. instead of fighting for conservatism. [Speaking to reporters after a campaign rally, Cruz said that the establishment was no longer looking to Marco Rubio as their champion.  “We’re seeing something remarkable happening in this Republican primary,” Cruz said, according to National Review’s Eliana Johnson. “Right now, the Washington establishment is abandoning Marco Rubio, they’ve made the assessment that Marco can’t win this race, and the Washington establishment is rushing over to support Donald Trump. We’re seeing that happen every day, and Mr. Trump is welcoming that support. ” Last night, Cruz made a similar argument in a recent interview, calling Trump part of the “Washington cartel. ” “The cartel exists to make deals and to pick winners and losers through cronyism and corporate welfare,” Cruz said in an interview with BuzzFeed’s Rosie Gray. “And so it’s no surprise that more and more of the establishment is beginning to support Donald Trump. Because Donald has promised to make deals and to continue the cronyism and corporate welfare of Washington. That’s what the cartel does. They make deals with Democrats. ” Cruz said that Trump was more likely to make deals with Democrats to help get things done. “Donald Trump said just yesterday that the problem with me is that I wouldn’t go to Washington to make a deal and go along to get along with the Democrats,” Cruz said in the interview. “If you’re looking for someone who’s a dealmaker, who’ll capitulate even more to the Democrats, who’ll give in to Chuck Schumer, Harry Reid, and Nancy Pelosi, then perhaps Donald Trump is your man. ”
