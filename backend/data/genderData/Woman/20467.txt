A homophobic “hate crime” supposedly inspired by President elect Donald Trump at North Park University in Chicago has been revealed to be a hoax, according to the university’s president. [The alleged victim, who says she is bisexual, claimed to have received mail that contained a range of homophobic slurs accompanied by the hashtag “#Trump,” according to NBC News.  She claimed to have received a string of anonymous emails which also contained abusive language, adding that the abuse was part of a “country wide epidemic emboldened by this election. ” However, in a letter to students, university president David Parkyn confirmed that the “the incident and related messages were fabricated. ” “We are confident there is no further threat of repeated intolerance to any member of our campus community stemming from this recent incident,” Parkyn continued, adding that the student had now left the university. The incident is not the first example of a hate crime hoax following Donald Trump’s victory. Shortly after his election, a Muslim student was charged for falsely claiming that her hijab was pulled from her head by a Trump supporter. Meanwhile, a black female student from Bowling Green State University has been charged with filing a fake police report after fabricating a story that white Trump supporters had thrown rocks at her in a racially motivated attack.
