Now tackle  —      tackle  —     penalty,” Trump said.’ ’”I don’’t watch it. The referees, they all throw flags. Their wives are sitting at home   ’’That’’s my husband! ’’” Trump said, launching into a   impression of the wives of NFL referees. ”It’’s true.” ’ ’After facing fierce criticism for not doing enough to lower the number and severity of traumatic head injuries,  to strengthen some rules and pour money into researching equipment that can absorb more physical punishment.  ’ ’Trump,  launched into his tangent about the NFL on Sunday after pausing in his speech to ask the crowd if he should keep going.’ ’”It’’s a Sunday, who the hell wants to watch these crummy games?” Trump said as some members of the audience applauded. ’ ’Though Trump made his feelings about the state of football pretty clear, he did, make one exception.’ ’”I do love Tom Brady, he’’s a great guy,” he said. ’
