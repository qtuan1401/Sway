GOP presidential candidate Sen. Ted Cruz ( ) responded to GOP frontrunner Donald Trump’s comments about whether or not Cruz is a “natural born” citizen and able to run for President of the United States —  suggesting that Democrats are the ones prompting Trump to question Cruz’s citizenship. [“I will say it is more than a little strange to see Donald relying on as authoritative a liberal,   judicial activist Harvard law professor who is a huge Hillary supporter,” Cruz said to reporters in New Hampshire following a campaign rally, apparently referencing Harvard Law professor Lawrence Tribe’s legal analysis. “It starts to make you think, ‘Gosh, why are some of Hillary’s strongest supporters backing Donald Trump? ’”  Cruz reportedly also suggested that Democrats are trying to prop up a Republican candidate  —   such as Trump  —   that they think they can defeat in the general election. “You know, the last couple of elections, you’ll recall the Democrats got the nominee they wanted to run against in the general election,” Cruz challenged. “It seems the Hillary folks are very eager to support Donald Trump and the attacks that are being tossed my direction. ’” The debate over Cruz’s eligibility to run for President of the United States since he was born in Canada, but his mother was a U. S. citizen, began when Trump said it would be a “very precarious” issue in an interview last week with the Washington Post.
