WASHINGTON  —   Former President George Bush, the 41st president, was in stable condition at a Houston hospital on Wednesday after doctors performed a procedure to clear his airway, his spokesman said. His wife, Barbara Bush, was also admitted to the medical center, Houston Methodist Hospital, on Wednesday morning “as a precaution after experiencing fatigue and coughing,” the spokesman, Jim McGrath, said in a statement. Mr. Bush, 92, was suffering from an acute respiratory problem stemming from pneumonia when he was admitted to the intensive care unit at the hospital. After initial reports of Mr. Bush’s hospitalization, his office said he was expected to return home by the weekend. Mr. Bush, who served as vice president from   and president from   refused to support Donald J. Trump for president in last year’s election and had already declined to attend Friday’s inauguration, citing health concerns. Kathleen Kennedy Townsend, daughter of Robert F. Kennedy, said last fall that the former president had told her that he planned to vote for Hillary Clinton. His son, former President George W. Bush, and his wife, Laura, have announced that they plan to attend the inauguration, although former Gov. Jeb Bush of Florida, who lost the Republican nomination to Mr. Trump, does not intend to be there. Also scheduled to be on hand are Mrs. Clinton and former President Bill Clinton, as well as former President Jimmy Carter and his wife, Rosalynn.
