Sunday on CNN’s “State of the Union,” Republican   nominee Gov. Mike Pence ( ) said Democratic presidential nominee Hillary Clinton’s speech last week about the   movement cast “racist intention” on millions of Americans.  Pence said, “I think Sen. Kaine’s comments, Hillary Clinton’s comments on Thursday night sound desperate to me. I mean, to be honest with you. I don’t talk a lot about the polls, Jake, but I know the polls are all closing up. And the fact that you see Democrats and Hillary Clinton and her running mate rolling out the same old playbook of racial divisiveness, sounds a little bit to me like an act of desperation. I mean, look, the American people are sick and tired of politicians who seek to divide the people of this country, to unite their supporters. ” He added, “Hillary Clinton literally condemned not just Donald Trump, by the same terms, but also millions of Americans who long for a better future   …     I think she was calling millions of Americans around this country who believe we can make America great again, who believe that Hillary Clinton and Barack Obama’s policies have weakened America’s place in the world and stifled America’s economy, she has put some sort of racist intention those Americans. That’s deeply offensive. The American people see through it these days. ” Follow Pam Key on Twitter @pamkeyNEN
