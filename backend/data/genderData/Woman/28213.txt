On Friday’s broadcast of CNN’s “AC360,” former Obama adviser and CNN Political Commentator Van Jones stated that   Trump has “not spoken like a patriot yet. ”  Trumps said Trump “certainly knows how to respond when it’s personal. He knows how to respond when it’s partisan. You have the first attack on our country, acknowledged, since he’s been elected, and he’s not responded like a patriot yet. Now, that is very disturbing. Now, you guys keep wanting to point out that Obama did this and he did that, oh, and when  —   Van, when Trump gets here he’s going to do x, y, and z. The reality is, he talks all the time. He’s speaking tonight. He tweets like my children do, and he’s not spoken like a patriot yet. ” (  Mediaite) Follow Ian Hanchett on Twitter @IanHanchett
