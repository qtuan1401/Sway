Monday on his radio show, conservative talk show host Rush Limbaugh criticized Republican presidential   Donald Trump for how he has chosen to attack his opponent Sen. Ted Cruz ( ).  Limbaugh called Trump’s a “strategic error,” but explained that the conflict between the two was inevitable. “I sit back and I watch all of this play out,” Limbaugh said. “We’re watching a couple of really qualified professionals in the communications game go at it.  And, as is in the past, I do not even consider inserting myself in the middle of it, other than to tell you things I’m telling you here on the air. And I will tell you, like I’ve said before, that I think Trump is making a strategic error in the way he criticizes Cruz.  But, folks, it’s unrealistic to expect that they’re not gonna go after each other.  They’re number one and two.  Iowa and New Hampshire are at stake. This is politics. ” “There’s only one winner,” he continued. “The two of them can’t win this together in some sort of a bromance and come out as a united couple after either one of these primaries or after the whole process.  It’s not how it works.  They’re both gonna try to take each other out and they’re both gonna have their own strategies for doing so.  Now, Trump I think is  …     You know, Trump knows his coalition.  He knows who his base is.  His base is made of many people, more than just conservatives. ” “I’m gonna say ‘audience,’ here, but I mean his support base, the people who intend to vote for him.  There’s a lot of conservatives, disaffected and angry with the Republican Party.  And there are a lot of conservatives that support Trump who don’t like Ted Cruz.  I can’t explain it, but I hear it all over the place.  I hear all kinds of love, respect, and admiration for Cruz.  And I hear people at the same time who don’t like him for whatever reason they conjure up. ” Follow Jeff Poor on Twitter @jeff_poor
