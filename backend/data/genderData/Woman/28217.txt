“I’m going to support the Republican running against Hillary Clinton. .. ” @ScottWalkerhttps:  .  Tuesday on Fox News Channel’s “Fox  Friends,” Gov. Scott Walker ( ) a former candidate for the 2016 GOP nomination, said regard less of who is the ultimate Republican presidential nominee, he will support him over Hillary Clinton if she is the Democratic presidential nominee.  Walker, however, sang the virtues of Sen. Ted Cruz ( ) as a GOP presidential candidate and said if he were to win his home state today, it would be a “turning point” in this contest. “I’m going to support the Republican running against Hillary Clinton because Hillary Clinton would be an awful, awful president of the United States,” Walker said. “But I think the good news is starting today, you’re going to see in North Dakota, as we’ve seen in Colorado, as we’ve seen in some others, Utah  —   Ted Cruz has continued to win as people make it clear that it’s either Ted Cruz or Donald Trump. Those are the only two that mathematically can get to 1, 237 delegate votes needed to win the nomination. ” “I believe Ted Cruz is going to win here today because people are very well informed, as you well know here in the state of Wisconsin,” he continued. “That’s a big win for Ted because it’s an open caucus, it’s an upper Midwestern state. We’re somewhere in between Iowa and Michigan in terms of the   of Wisconsin. You’re going to have record turnout, so of the biggest we’ve had since 1980. And I believe Ted Cruz is going to win today. It’s going to be the turning point in this election. ” Follow Jeff Poor on Twitter @jeff_poor
