 (CNN) Reversing direction, NBC announced Friday it has pulled a politically charged episode of ”Law  Order: SVU.”  ”The episode originally scheduled for October 26 has been postponed. It has not yet been assigned a new airdate,” a spokesperson for NBC told CNN. The network did not say what prompted its decision. On Thursday, NBC unveiled its first look of the episode called ”Unstoppable” in which Gary Cole plays a rich politician whose campaign goes off the rails after several women come forward with damaging accusations.  ”I’m a handsome, charming millionaire. Women throw themselves at me,” the politician says in the promo.   NBC announced the episode earlier this week, just days after Republican presidential candidate Donald Trump was heard making lewd comments in a   leaked tape.   Trump has apologized for the comments and dismissed them as ”locker room talk.”  In light of his response, victims of sexual assault took to social media to share their stories.  Multiple women have also come forward with allegations of sexual misconduct against Trump.  Trump has denied the claims and threatened to sue The New York Times over its report on two alleged victims. NBC has shied away from officially using the   to describe the inspiration for the episode. But Variety reports the episode had a troubled journey from concept to screen due its portrayal of a character that would draw comparisons to Trump.
