Saturday night’s CBS Republican presidential debate was a heated affair, with the candidates often struggling to be heard over the cheers and jeers of an unusually rowdy audience at the Peace Center in Greenville, South Carolina. [Like the rest of us, Hollywood was watching as the   audience heckled outsider candidates Donald Trump and Sen. Ted Cruz and enthusiastically applauded mainstreamers Jeb Bush, Sen. Marco Rubio, and Gov. John Kasich.  Some seemed to enjoy the   tension: I never watched   wrestling before but now I get it  —   it’s fun! #GOPDebate,  —   Sarah Silverman (@SarahKSilverman) February 14, 2016,  Gladiator sport #GOPDebate,  —   mia farrow (@MiaFarrow) February 14, 2016,  I can’t believe this debate is real life.  —   christine teigen (@chrissyteigen) February 14, 2016,  OMG! !! What am I watching? ?? This is a mud fight!! I am expecting audience members to start throwing chairs very soon! #GOPdebate,  —   Clay Aiken (@clayaiken) February 14, 2016,  While others did not, including billionaire Dallas Mavericks owner Mark Cuban: Next Rep debate should not have an audience.  Shouting over them or trying to encourage applause influences the perception of the candidates,  —   Mark Cuban (@mcuban) February 14, 2016,  What is up with the audience at the #GOPDebate?

Rubio. If it wasn’t I would still be a slave and considered property. #GOPDebate,  —   Wendell Pierce (@WendellPierce) February 14, 2016,  Marco Rubio only accepts the original intent of the Constitution so I’d like to see his slaves.  #GOPDebate,  —   John Fugelsang (@JohnFugelsang) February 14, 2016,  White People director Jose Antonio Vargas took issue with the CBS moderators’ language: Did I just hear ”illegal aliens” in a @CBSNews’ #GOPDebate? #WordsMatter @DefineAmerican,  —   Jose Antonio Vargas (@joseiswriting) February 14, 2016,  While George Lopez and Adam Goldberg supplied the jokes and Mia Farrow made a surprise admission: We need to take our country back #MakeAmericaGreatAgain pic. twitter.   —   George Lopez (@georgelopez) February 14, 2016,  Ben Carson massacres the art of debate with the precision of a drowsy surgeon.  —   Adam Goldberg (@TheAdamGoldberg) February 14, 2016,  Trump is RIGHT for once!!  —   mia farrow (@MiaFarrow) February 14, 2016,
