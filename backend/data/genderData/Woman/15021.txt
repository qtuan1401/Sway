[“It’s been a heartrending time to be both a woman and an immigrant in this country,” the Ugly Betty star said. “Our dignity, our character, our rights have all been under attack, and a platform of hate and division assumed power yesterday. ”  Ferrera, who spoke at the Democratic National Convention last summer, said that the Trump administration and the   Congress don’t represent America. “But the president is not America. His cabinet is not America. Congress is not America,” she said. “We are America. And we are here to stay. ” Actress America Ferrera speaks at the #WomensMarch in Washington, DC: ”Our rights have all been under attack” https:  .   —   CNN Politics (@CNNPolitics) January 21, 2017,  “We march today for our families and our neighbors, for our future, for the causes we claim and for the causes that claim us,” the    actress added. Ferrera told the crowd of protesters that President Trump is not the “moral core” of America. “We march today for the moral core of this nation, against which our new president is waging a war.
