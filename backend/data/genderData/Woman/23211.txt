Hillary Clinton’s campaign chairman John Podesta was reportedly hacked on Twitter Wednesday night, with the perpetrator posting, “I’ve switched sides. Vote Trump 2016. Hi pol,” after several of Podesta’s accounts were compromised following the latest WikiLeaks email release. [Numerous users took the moment to criticize Podesta’s security measures, after a series of his accounts had been compromised following the inclusion of his Apple ID and password in a leaked email.  “Jesus Christ, John.   authentication!” recommended one user, while another added, “you gotta get better passwords my dude. ” “I love the Dems, but y’all really need better security of your online accounts,” criticized one Hillary Clinton supporter. “In fact, just use paper  typewriters. ” The use of “Hi pol” in the hacker’s tweet appears to be a reference to 4chan’s “politically incorrect” board, which is often shortened to just “pol. ” The tweet has since been deleted.
