”De overwinning van #Trump is een staatsgreep door de FBI” zegt Sidney Blumenthal, vriend en adviseur van #Clinton. https:  .  pic. twitter.  In a   interview with Dutch TV Nieuwsuur,   Clinton ally Sidney Blumenthal expressed his dismay over last Tuesday’s presidential election results, which was a defeat for Democrat Hillary Clinton.  Blumenthal described the loss as a “coup,” which was orchestrated by the FBI’s New York office and that former New York City Mayor Rudy Giuliani, a backer of   Donald Trump, was connected. “It was the result of a cabal of   agents of the FBI in the New York office attached to Rudy Giuliani, who was a member of Trump’s campaign,” Blumenthal said. “And I think it’s not unfair to call it a coup. ” “A coup, even?” the Dutch television interviewer asked. “Yeah, a coup d’etat,” Blumenthal replied.
