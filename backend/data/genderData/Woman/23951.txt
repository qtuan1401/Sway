Well, that was the easy part. All Trump had to do was vanquish people too stupid to pick up the   bill lying on the sidewalk  —   smug, smirking,    establishment drones. [Now comes the part Americans have desperately hoped for, but almost never seen: A politician keeping his promises to the American people. (See, e. g. Senate candidate Marco Rubio’s 2010 promise to oppose amnesty if elected Sen. Mitch McConnell’s 2014 promise to block Obama’s executive amnesty if Republicans were handed a Senate majority Jeb Bush, John Kasich and Ted Cruz’s promise to support the 2016 Republican presidential nominee.)  Hey, anybody else remember “Read My Lips”? That was from the family too pristine to sully themselves by voting for Trump. With the   of everything else they’ve said wrong about Trump from Day One, the media are already announcing that he, too, will betray the American people. I don’t think so! To help Mr. Trump keep his promises, I’ve compiled a detailed schedule for his first 100 days in office. Please note that each day is meticulously planned: Day 1: Start building the wall.
