Monday on Fox Business Network’s “Varney  Company,” while discussing Democratic presidential nominee Hillary Clinton’s Friday night comments describing half of Republican nominee Donald Trump’s supporters as “deplorables” driven by “racist, sexist, homophobic, xenophobic, Islamaphobic” beliefs, former U. K. Independence Party leader Nigel Farage said of Clinton “only one person comes out of this deplorably,” which is Clinton.  Farage said, “When David Cameron once was asked about UKIP voters, he said they are loonies, fruitcakes and closet racists mostly. Well, that was nice of the prime minister, wasn’t it, to talk about millions of British people. And what happened during the referendum was they said that leave voters are old, angry,   and motivated by racist thoughts. Now, the reason for doing that was to say to people in the middle, to say to undecided voters, look, for goodness sake, if you vote leave the E. U. you are joining up with this appalling group of people. And that’s exactly the same game that Hillary was trying to play just a few days ago. And when she used the word “deplorables,” well, I’ll tell you what I think —  I think only one person comes out of this deplorably, and that’s Hillary Clinton. Part of that same kind of elite that I saw in London, but in this case based in Washington, who has absolutely no understanding of how ordinary people live their lives. ” He added, “Well, what we’ve seen I think over the Western world, you know, last 10, 20 years is this new sort of political aristocracy that have taken over and the Clinton family in America, you know, sum it up rather beautifully. And they are very out of touch with the views of ordinary people. And if they think by insulting the silent majority they’re doing themselves a favor by effectively demeaning people, by demonizing people, then they were in for a big shock in Brexit, and I suspect she’s in for a big shock in this American campaign as well. ” Follow Pam Key on Twitter @pamkeyNEN
