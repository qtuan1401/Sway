A Donald Trump event planned for Sunday afternoon in Cincinnati, Ohio has been canceled in the wake of the radical left’s violent and chaotic protest that shut down a Donald Trump event in Chicago on Friday night. [The Trump rally was supposed to be held just days before the crucial Ohio primary. It was scheduled to start at noon on Sunday, at the Duke Energy Convention Center.  USA Today reports: The Secret Service security supporting the GOP presidential front runner’s campaign could not complete its preparation work in time to hold the event at the Duke Energy Convention Center, said Eric Deters, a local spokesman for Trump’s campaign. “Trump wants to come here, and the campaign is still looking to find a location for either Sunday or Monday,” Deters said. This latest shutdown shows the momentum of leftist protesters, including Black Lives Matter. As Breitbart News reported, a rash of social media calls for Trump’s assassination have been posted on Twitter with no apparent consequences. **UPDATE** Donald Trump tweeted on Saturday morning that the Cincinnati event was proceeding as scheduled: The rally in Cincinnati is ON. Media put out false reports that it was cancelled. Will be great  —   love you Ohio!  —   Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) March 12, 2016,  Breitbart News has reached out to Trump’s campaign for confirmation.
