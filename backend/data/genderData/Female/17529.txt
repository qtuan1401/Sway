Sunday, on NBC’s “Meet the Press,” while commenting on the recent police shootings in Louisiana and Minnesota and a sniper targeting and killing five Dallas police officers, Senator Cory Booker ( ) said presumptive Republican presidential nominee Donald Trump is “callously stoking hate and fear,” by “demeaning women, demeaning Muslims, demeaning Latinos, at a time where our country needs reconciliation, we need people that bind our wounds, and build bridges across our chasms. ”  Booker said, “We have to all understand we have a country with deep reservoirs of love. We are good people. We are   people, and when called upon, we rise to an occasion. This is such an occasion. And I’m going to be very blunt. I’ve watched in pain, when I see a presidential candidate, all of our words matter, whether you’re a citizen or a presidential candidate, words matter, and this is a time where we need courageous empathy, where we need undeterred love. And so, when I hear a presidential candidate like Donald Trump gratuitously demeaning women, demeaning Muslims, demeaning Latinos, at a time where our country needs reconciliation, we need people that bind our wounds, and build bridges across our chasms. To see someone so callously stoking hate and fear, and inflaming divide. This is not the person to be president of the United States, I believe, ever, but definitely, not at a time that we need a healer, a reconciler, and somebody to remind us that as a nation, our differences matter, but our country matters more. ” Follow Pam Key On Twitter @pamkeyNEN,
