New polling data has revealed that a majority of both Republicans and Independents approve of Donald Trump’s threat to appoint a special prosecutor to investigate Hillary Clinton’s email scandal should he win the presidency. [In a poll conducted by YouGov and The Huffington Post, 64 percent of Republicans approved of Trump’s comments opposed to just 24 percent who did not, whilst 46 percent of Independents approved compared to 41 percent who thought they were inappropriate.  However, an overwhelming majority (87 percent) of Democrats considered the threat inappropriate compared to just 9 percent who thought it was, meaning 52 percent of total viewers surveyed opposed the comments, compared to 38 percent who approved of them. Meanwhile, a smaller percentage of viewers surveyed thought Trump’s attacks against Bill Clinton’s sexual history were justified, with 55 percent of viewers deeming the comments inappropriate, with a majority of Independents disapproving of them. Furthermore, a majority of viewers questioned (51 percent) felt that Donald Trump’s apology over comments he made about a woman in 2005 was unsatisfactory. This figure was considerably higher among women than men. Overall, 31 percent of people remained satisfied with the apology, whilst 11 percent felt he had nothing to apologize for.
