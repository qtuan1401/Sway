Fake journalist Brian Williams, who was suspended from the NBC Nightly News anchor slot for reporting fake news and lost the job altogether  —   and is now relegated to an MSNBC position  —   slammed fake news on MSNBC on Thursday. [“Fake news played a role in this election and continues to find a wide audience,” Williams said, before attacking retired Army Lt. Gen. Mike Flynn —    Donald Trump’s National Security Adviser —  and Breitbart News Network.  It’s curious that Williams is becoming the face of the legacy and establishment media charge against “fake news,” the matter that such media luminaries are rallying around to blame their widely inaccurate reporting of the 2016 presidential election. Williams lost his slot as anchor of the NBC Nightly News after he made up scores of accounts, passing off completely fabricated stories as journalism. In fact, back in early 2015, Breitbart News presented a list of at least 32 times that NBC News let Williams present such fake news to the American people —  lies and disputed stories —  including his false claims about being in a helicopter that was hit by an RPG. Williams also made up stories about Seal Team 6, the fall of the Berlin Wall, the Pope, Hurricane Katrina, quitting college, rescuing a puppy from a house fire, and more. Williams was suspended, handing the NBC Nightly News to its current anchor Lester Holt, and then, after a great deal of time, was reinstated over at MSNBC —  the openly partisan progressive cable news network.
