’  ’ ’   WASHINGTON (AP)  —   President Donald Trump is outlining the    health of the business assets he placed   into a trust when he took office. ’ ’   The information comes in a new     he   voluntarily made Friday to the Office of Government Ethics. The   documents cover January 2016 through this spring.  ’ ’   The report shows Trump resigned from more than 500 positions,   many of them a day before his inauguration as president. Trump   listed at least $315 million in liabilities, about the same as in   a report he filed last year. ’ ”   The documents have added importance because Trump isn’t following   the long tradition of presidential candidates and     of making public his tax returns. Those returns provide more   complete  information than the personal     which only   include broad ranges for income and debts. ” ’ ’ ’WASHINGTON (AP)  —   President Donald Trump. ..’ ’’ ’’ ’’
