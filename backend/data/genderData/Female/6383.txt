Here are the week’s top stories, and a look ahead. 1.   Donald Trump opened up a surprising rift with U. S. intelligence agencies, lashing out over their assessments that Russian hackers acted covertly to further his campaign. “To have the   of the United States simply reject the   narrative that the intelligence community puts together because it conflicts with his a priori assumptions  —   wow,” said Michael V. Hayden, a former director of the N. S. A. and C. I. A. Other top Republicans are vowing investigations into Kremlin activities. _____ 2. Mr. Trump has a busy week ahead. In addition to a meeting in New York with tech leaders, he’s also planning to continue his victory tour with stops in Wisconsin, Pennsylvania, Florida and Alabama. Rex Tillerson, above, the head of Exxon Mobil, is expected to be Mr. Trump’s pick for secretary of state. We’re keeping track of all the selections for top posts here. An unusual questionnaire from Mr. Trump’s transition team is being circulated to managers at the Energy Department that requests the names of all employees and contractors who have attended climate change policy conferences. _____ 3. The U. S. will send 200 additional troops to Syria, nearly doubling the Pentagon’s presence there, Defense Secretary Ashton Carter, above, announced. The reinforcements will join Special Operations forces in recruiting, training and advising Kurdish and Arab fighters massing for an assault on the Islamic State’s stronghold of Raqqa. _____ 4. An email about walnut sauce. An Instagram of a   refrigerator. Interpreting “cheese pizza” as code for “child pornography. ” A week after an armed man showed up at a Washington pizzeria looking for child slaves, we broke down the wild conspiracy theory about Hillary Clinton and her top aides running a   ring out of the restaurant. _____ 5. The      —   a movement of many factions  —   is trying to change its image now that its profile has risen. Some groups are ditching the use of symbols like the swastika in an effort to become more mainstream. The message of racial separation and supremacy, however, remains unchanged. Matthew Heimbach, above with his family, runs a group that advocates replacing the United States with   based on races, ethnicities and religions. _____ 6. The latest in our series on how private equity investors influence daily American life focuses on a   snack cake: the Twinkie. Investment firms brought the Twinkie back to shelves in 2013, months after Hostess had shuttered its bakeries and laid off workers. Our investigation of the financial maneuvering found a blueprint for how a select number of executives have amassed some of the greatest fortunes of the modern era. _____ 7. The death penalty trial of Dylann Roof, who is accused of massacring nine people at a prominent black church in Charleston, S. C. opened last week with   testimony from one of the survivors. Jurors were shown video of him confessing to F. B. I. agents  —   calmly, clinically and occasionally chortling. Mr. Roof’s mother had a heart attack during the trial’s opening day. _____ 8. A new project is using satellite images to illustrate how the world’s lakes and rivers have changed over the past three decades. It’ll help researchers improve climate models, but even the untrained eye can see the impact of droughts and warming temperatures. Above, Lake Mead in Nevada. _____ 9. Lamar Jackson, Louisville’s sophomore quarterback, won the 82nd Heisman Trophy on Saturday. He beat out four other hopefuls as the most outstanding player in college football. Jackson, who had been heavily favored, is the youngest player to win the award. _____ 10. The Federal Reserve is expected to announce on Wednesday that it will raise interest rates for the first time this year. Above, Janet Yellen, the Fed’s chairwoman. (Earlier, we spelled her last name incorrectly.) Fed officials went into 2016 thinking they might raise the benchmark interest rate as much as four times, but have held back. Here’s a look at why an increase is expected now. _____ 11. The ceremony to award the 2016 Nobel Prize in Literature was held Saturday in Stockholm. As expected, Bob Dylan was not there to accept it. One last question remains: How will the elusive Mr. Dylan handle the prize’s requirement that he give a Nobel lecture within six months of the ceremony? _____ 12. Finally,  shades of “Jurassic Park. ” A piece of amber found at a market in Myanmar has preserved a feathered dinosaur tail for about 99 million years  —   a first. The dinosaur may have looked like a   version of T. rex. An amber expert who examined the specimen said, “You’re like ‘Wow, it’s the closest you’ll ever get to holding a   dinosaur in your hands. ’” _____ Have a great week.
