Center for Security Policy founder Frank Gaffney joined SiriusXM host Stephen K. Bannon on Wednesday’s Breitbart News Daily to discuss the ongoing feud between Donald Trump and the Khans, the Gold Star family that attacked him from the stage of the Democratic National Convention. [Gaffney said the story has been “a huge distraction from the main issue  —   which, in fact, this Gold Star father was trotted out to try to sort of obscure, and that is: should we be importing, into this country, more jihadists?”  “By some polls, 80% of the American people quite   say, ‘No, we’ve got plenty here,’” he observed. Gaffney said: One way to filter the Muslims who are absolutely, positively a problem, from Muslims who aren’t  —   and who I think we quite possibly would love to have in this country  —   is, are they adherent to this sharia doctrine? Do they believe that it, not our Constitution, ought to govern the United States, that democracy ought to be the basis on which we govern ourselves, with representative government? He said those Republican ideals are inconsistent with the support for sharia Khizr Khan “absolutely embraces, supports, and is seeking to promote. ” “Anderson Cooper, last night, he’s on his program, and he says, quote, ‘I do not stand for any sharia law because there is no such thing,’” Gaffney said incredulously of an interview Khan gave CNN. “You gotta say, Steve, A, that’s taqiyya  —   that is, lying for the faith  —   and B, it is demonstrably fraudulent. ”  “This is why I think this issue isn’t going to go away. It has nothing to do with the Gold Star issue,” he stressed. “I’m sorry to say that this couple lost their son, and a hero at that. But this is about the central question of our time: will we, as in Europe, be induced to submit to sharia by importing still more of the people who believe that it’s God’s will to impose it upon us?” Breitbart News Daily airs on SiriusXM Patriot 125 weekdays from 6:00 a. m. to 9:00 a. m.
