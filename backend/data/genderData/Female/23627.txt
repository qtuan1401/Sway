Jamelle Bouie writes in Slate: Donald Trump is a nativist demogogue who attacks racial and religious minorities and heaps praise on authoritarian leaders abroad. He borrows from white nationalists and channels the worst impulses in American life. He’s an opportunist with little connection to the Republican Party or the conservative movement. If he has a serious rival for the GOP presidential nomination, it’s Ted Cruz, the caustic senator from Texas.

If he got nominated he’d be scared to death,“ explained Charles Black, a former GOP operative, to the Times. ”That’s the point he would call people in the party and say, ‘I just want to talk to you.’ ” John Feehery, a former Republican congressional aide, put it simply. “Trump won’t do   damage to the GOP coalition,” he said to the Times. “Cruz will. ” You can read the rest of the story here.
