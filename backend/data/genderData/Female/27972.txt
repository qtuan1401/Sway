On Saturday’s “Justice” on Fox News Channel, host Judge Jeanine Pirro predicted that what happened this week with the United Kingdom voting to leave the E. U. will happen again in the United States.  “What happened in England is going to happen again. Next stop, the United States. Next president, Donald J. Trump. What happened in the U. K. this week is just the beginning. The world is changing and all you elite establishment, ruling class, condescending, Washington big wigs who think you know better than ordinary Americans are out. Start packing. Your days are numbered,” Pirro said. Judge Jeanine later added that Americans who are fed up with the “‘we are the world’ song and dance will catapult Donald Trump to the White House. ” She continued, “When our president’s first response to an American getting his head cut off is to show up in a golf cart and then keep on golfing when he and his attorney general’s response to Americans being killed by Muslim terrorists is to stand up for Muslims, then it’s time to take our country back. ” Follow Trent Baker on Twitter @MagnifiTrent
