’  ’ ’   President Barack Obama said in his final press conference of the   year that he feels ”responsible” for the bloodshed in Syria, and   that his administration ”went through every option” to try and   limit the violence there. ’ ’   ”I always feel responsible,” the president said in response to a   question about whether he felt a ”moral responsibility for   the carnage” in Syria’’s largest city, Aleppo, after failing   to intervene in the Syrian civil war early on. ’ ’   ”I felt responsible when kids were being shot by snipers, when   millions of people were being displaced,” he said. ”I feel   responsible for murder and slaughter that’’s taking place in south   Sudan that’’s not being reported on . .. t ’ ’  ’ ’  ’ ’  ’ ’  ’ ’  ’ ’  ’ ’   The president reiterated his support for the   and   evacuation deal that is currently under way in Aleppo, the   epicenter of the nearly   civil war. ’ ’   ”Our biggest priority right now is to put pressure, wherever we   can, to try and get [the civilians] out” of Aleppo, Obama said,   and noted that he would help   Donald Trump  —     who said on Thursday that he is in favor of establishing   humanitarian safe zones in Syria  —   with any advice he can provide   so that he can make informed decisions. ’ ’   But he contended that because the safe zones would be in   Syrian territory, ”some force” would be required to maintain them   in the absence of consent from the Syrian government, the   Russians, and the Iranians. ’ ’   ”If we can get more of the tens of thousands of people that are   still trapped in Aleppo out,” Obama said, ”as long as the world’’s   eyes are on them, the regime and Russia can hopefully find an   arrangement whereby those people are kept safe.” ’
