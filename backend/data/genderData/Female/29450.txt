Sunday on NBC’s “Meet The Press,” while discussing the popularity of Republican presidential nominee Donald Trump talk show host Glenn Beck said “they were mocking me for bringing up Nazis, the reason why I did many of the times was the warn about the rise of the   in Europe that would bleed into America. It’s happening. ”  Beck said, “Nobody feels like they’re listening. We’re shouting over each other, and you know, everything  —   I mean, I was watching the first 20 minutes of the show. Gee, who would have guessed those guests would have said those things? Everybody feels like there is a play going on, and we’re just watching it and looking at each other and shaking our heads in disbelief. Nobody is listening to the hard working American who doesn’t feel like they belong to anything anymore. ” “In fact, it’s almost as if we’re standing outside, and we’re not being invited to this party at all,” he continued. “It’s going to backfire. It’s interesting that you would have Michael Moore and me both on the same show talking about this because I think there’s a lot of people that would claim that Michael Moore and Glenn Beck are responsible for a lot of this. I can’t speak for Michael because I honestly don’t watch much of what he does, and I’m sure he doesn’t with me, but I warned about this. You know, when they were mocking me for bringing up Nazis, the reason why I did many of the times was the warn about the rise of the uber right in Europe that would bleed into America. It’s happening. We have to change our course, and we have to change our course as individuals now. ” Follow Pam Key on Twitter @pamkeyNEN
