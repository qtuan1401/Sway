The Golden Bear says he plans to vote for the Donald. [“I like the guy,” Jack Nicklaus told Jim Axelrod in an interview for CBS Sunday Morning. “He’s a good man. And certainly if he’s the one that’s on the ticket, I’ll be voting for him. ”  Donald Trump attended the Capitol Hill ceremony that saw Jack Nicklaus receive the Congressional Gold Medal last year and worked with the   winner of major tournaments on several   projects. “Donald was terrific,” Nicklaus maintains. “I’ve done several things with Donald on golf courses. And he’s treated me great. He’s been aboveboard. ” The Ohioan joins numerous prominent sports figures, including Tom Brady, Mike Tyson, and Bob Knight, in voicing support for Trump’s presidential run. “I don’t want to get political in this, I like what Donald has done,” Nicklaus holds. “He’s turning America  . He’s awakening the country. ” The golfer adds, “We need a lot of that. ”
