On Breitbart News Daily Monday morning, Joe Borelli, New York City Councilman and Donald Trump’s   for the state, said that while Sen. Ted Cruz has skillfully sewn up delegates in Colorado and Wyoming, a blowout vote for Trump in New York could make the senator’s victories irrelevant and crown Trump as the party’s nominee. [“Trump is probably going to win over 50 percent in the majority of the congressional districts around the state and I think he comes away with the vast majority of delegates,” he said. “And a week after that, we’re in five Northeastern states, where we have 172 delegates that are at stake, and by all polling, it seems as though Donald Trump is going to go out with the lion’s share of those as well. That brings him over the thousand mark. So, I think whether the public likes it or not, they’re going to have to start warming to the fact that Donald Trump will be the presumptive nominee come the convention. ”  “The criticisms are valid that the campaign did a poor job in some states rallying delegates around them,” Borelli said. “And Ted Cruz, to his credit, had a great weekend. But if we’re counting 14 delegates in Wyoming as this monstrous victory for Ted Cruz  —   again, what happens come tomorrow night when Donald Trump potentially has the ability to win all 95 delegates?” “In this state, he’s done a tremendous job, actually, and has really started to develop his ground game. He has the support of the majority of the upstate county chairmen who are the ones who would actually be doing the appointing of the delegates,” he continued. “So I think this just naturally parlays into the other Northeastern states on Tuesday, where he’s also trying to do the same thing, recruiting county chairmen and state chairmen. ” Breitbart News Daily airs from 6 am to 9 am EST weekdays on SiriusXM Patriot 125.
