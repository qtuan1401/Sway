’  ’ ”   The executive editor of The New York Times said in an interview   this week that journalists at his publication, and elsewhere,   have a hard time understanding religion and the role it plays in   people’s lives. ” ’   Dean Baquet  one of his goals after the election   was to ”make sure that we are much more creative about beats out   in the country so that we understand that anger and   disconnectedness that people feel.” ’ ’   ”And I think I use religion as an example because I was raised   Catholic in New Orleans,” he said. ”I think that the New      —   and   too, probably  —   media   powerhouses don’’t quite get religion.” ’ ’   Baquet continued: ”We have a fabulous religion writer, but she’’s   all alone. We don’’t get religion. We don’’t get the role of   religion in people’’s lives. And I think we can do much, much   better.” ’ ’   The editor, who has helmed The Times since 2014, added that he   believed ”there are things that we can be more creative about to   understand the country.” ’ ’’ ”   Since   Donald Trump’s unforeseen victory over   Hillary Clinton last month, various news outlets have pondered   how forecasts and predictions could have been so wrong. ” ’   ”That’’s how I look at it,” Baquet said. ”I now have two big jobs.   Big job one is to cover the most compelling and unusual president   we have had in my lifetime. ’ ’   ”Big job two is to really understand and explain the forces in   America that led to Americans wanting a change so much that they   were willing to select such a different figure for the White   House. Those are my two big jobs.” ’
