On Thursday’s broadcast of the Fox News Channel’s “O’Reilly Factor,” GOP presidential candidate Donald Trump stated that “the doctor, or whoever it may be that’s really doing the act, or is responsible for the act, not the woman is responsible” is “the way I’ve always felt” and “It could be that I misspoke” when he said women who have abortions should be punished.
