22 people have been confirmed dead and around 120 others are injured following reports of multiple explosions after an Ariana Grande concert in Manchester in the North of England on Monday Evening. [Greater Manchester Police originally said there had been a “number of fatalities and others injured” at the Manchester Arena, where   pop singer Ariana Grande was performing. Nineteen people were confirmed dead as of 8pm EST.  Chief Constable Ian Hopkins has confirmed the man suspected of carrying out last night’s attack was    Salman Abedi. Eyewitness accounts posted to social media show convoys of ambulances moving to the centre of Manchester as thousands of music fans fled the Manchester Evening News Arena. Live updates: UPDATE 0900 BST  —   First image released of Salman Abedi, UPDATE 0820 BST  —   Home Secretary Amber Rudd confirms Manchester bomber Salman Abedi was known “up to a point” to the intelligence services  Ms. Rudd disclosed on Sky News that Salman Abedi was known “up to a point” to intelligence services. She also warned it seemed “likely” Abedi “was not doing this on his own”. UPDATE Wednesday 24 May 0800 BST  —   Metropolitan police confirms military to be deployed at key locations across London, Following the terror threat level being raised to its highest rating, critical, London’s Metropolitan police confirmed the military will be working under the police and deployed as armed guards across key locations in London.  In a statement, the Metropolitan Police Services (MPS) confirmed: “As part of the   and tested deployment under Operation Temperer the military will be working under the MPS command structure to provide static armed guarding at key locations. This will include Buckingham Palace, Downing Street, Embassies and the Palace of Westminster. This will free up armed officers to carry out patrols. ” Commander Jane Connors, leading the London policing operation, said: “We are using every tactical option  —   not just through the use of armed officers but ongoing work by the Counter Terrorism Command working with partner agencies and gathering community intelligence. ” He added: “Operations for upcoming events are now under review and there will be additional security arrangements put in place. Specialist officers who are experts in protective security arrangements are advising businesses, event organisers and venues across London. ” UPDATE 2210 BST  —    May raises threat level to critical, ready to deploy Army on the streets  —   “Operation Temperer is now in force. ” In a televised statement from Downing Street, Prime Minister Theresa May said the U. K.’s terrorism threat level has been raised from severe to critical. ITV notes this level means “a terrorist attack is considered imminent. ” “It is a possibility that we cannot ignore that there is a wider group of individuals linked to this attack,” said May. She said the higher threat level means “there will be additional support available to the police as they work to keep us safe. ” “Operation Temperer is now in force,” May stated. Operation Temperer is a plan formulated after the Paris massacre, once considered secret by the British government, that could put up to 5, 000 soldiers on the streets in the event of a major terrorist attack. May specifically stated that initiating Operation Temperer meant the protection of key sites would be handed over to military personnel instead of the police, freeing up police officers for other duties. “You might also see military personnel deployed at certain events, such as concerts and sports matches, helping the police to keep the public safe,” the Prime Minister explained. “In all circumstances, members of the Armed Forces who are deployed in this way will be under the command of police officers. ” “I do not want the public to feel unduly alarmed,” she emphasized. “We have faced a serious terrorist threat in our country for many years. The operational response I have just outlined is a proportionate and sensible response to the threat that our security experts judge we face. I ask everyone to be vigilant and to cooperate with and support the police as they go about their important work. ” “The spirit of Manchester and the spirit of Britain is far mightier than the sick plots of depraved terrorists,” May declared. “That is why the terrorists will never win, and we will prevail. ” UPDATE 2115 BST  —    Morrissey: “Politicians tell us they are unafraid, but they are never the victims. ” Singer Morrissey, who hails from Manchester and was celebrating his birthday in town when news of the bomb attack broke, wrote a furious Facebook post in which he excoriated British politicians for leaving the people at risk while they enjoy security protection. “The anger is monumental. For what reason will this ever stop?” Morrissey asked, before calling everyone from the mayor of Manchester to the Queen of England on the carpet: Theresa May says such attacks “will not break us” but her own life is lived in a   bubble, and she evidently does not need to identify any young people today in Manchester morgues. Also, “will not break us” means that the tragedy will not break her, or her policies on immigration. The young people of Manchester are already broken  —   thanks all the same, Theresa.  Sadiq Khan says “London is united with Manchester” but he does not condemn Islamic State  —   who have claimed responsibility for the bomb. The Queen receives absurd praise for her ‘strong words’ against the attack, yet she does not cancel today’s garden party at Buckingham Palace  —   for which no criticism is allowed in the Britain of free press.  Manchester mayor Andy Burnham says the attack is the work of an “extremist”. An extreme what? An extreme rabbit? In modern Britain, everyone seems petrified to officially say what we all say in private. Politicians tell us they are unafraid, but they are never the victims. How easy to be unafraid when one is protected from the line of fire. The people have no such protections. UPDATE 1945 BST  —    Man with knife and baseball bat arrested at vigil in Birmingham: The Sun reports that police “swooped on a suspected knifeman armed with a baseball bat in Birmingham as a vigil was being held for victims of the Manchester terror attack. ” A witness reported “loud shouting” and armed police officers announcing a security alert. UPDATE 1840 BST  —    Manchester United players observe moment of silence before practice: The team is scheduled to play in the Europa League final on Wednesday. “We are all very sad about the tragic events last night we cannot take out of our minds and our hearts the victims and their families. We have a job to do and we will fly to Sweden to do that job. It is a pity we cannot fly with the happiness that we always have before a big game. I know, even during my short time here, that the people of Manchester will pull together as one,” said team manager Jose Mourinho. ITV reports that Manchester City manager Pep Guardiola’s wife and two children attended the Ariana Grande concert. They are all said to be “safe and well. ” UPDATE 1825 BST  —    Burj Khalifa tower in Dubai lit with Union Jack for Manchester victims: Dubai’s Burj Khalifa lit up with the Union Jack tonight #ManchesterBombing, (via gzshr on instagram) pic. twitter.   —   Anup Kaphle (@AnupKaphle) May 23, 2017,  UPDATE 1745 BST  —    Police confirm terror suspect is    Salman Abedi.

We accept that this is inevitable however we ask that people allow the police and coroner to release the names once the families are ready and appropriately supported. “As you would expect the police response to this across Greater Manchester has been significant as we support people to go about their daily business. “Part of this response has seen us arrest a    man in connection with the attack and we have also carried out two warrants, one in Whalley Range and one in Fallowfield that included a controlled explosion to enable safe entry. “We understand that feelings are very raw right now and people are bound to be looking for answers. However, now, more than ever, it is vital that our diverse communities in Greater Manchester stand together and do not tolerate hate. “We have been visited by the Prime Minster and Home Secretary and we have taken them through the emergency response so far and what we plan to do in future days. “I can confirm that the man suspected of carrying out last night’s atrocity has been named as    Salman Abedi. However, he has not yet been formally identified and I wouldn’t wish, therefore, to comment further. “The priority remains to establish whether he was acting alone or as part of a network.

She was loved by everyone and her warmth and kindness will be remembered fondly. Saffie was quiet and unassuming with a creative flair”.  UPDATE 1315 BST  —   Full text of Islamic State claim, The Site Intelligence Group, a monitoring organisation which has access to the Islamic State’s media channels including the Amaq news agency has repoduced the   version of the Islamic State claim for responsibility for last night’s attack. Calling the Ariana Grande concert a “gathering of the Crusaders in the British city of Manchester  …     the shameless concert arena” the release referred to the children at the show “worshippers of the cross” and the attacker “a soldier of the Khalifa”. What this claim means for the investigation is unclear. The Islamic State has claimed many terror attacks in Europe in recent years  —   an easy thing to do if the killer is already dead. It may be the case that while the Islamic State didn’t have advance warning of the attack the killer may have been inspired by Islamic State propaganda, and informed by Islamic State documents on bomb making and attacks as has been the case in the past. #ISIS releases   version of claim for #Manchester bombing pic. twitter.   —   SITE Intel Group (@siteintelgroup) May 23, 2017,  UPDATE 1300 BST  —   Associated Press: Islamic State claim responsibility for Manchester Suicide Bombing, The Associated Press agency has reported the Islamic State group has claimed one of their members was responsible for last night’s attack.
