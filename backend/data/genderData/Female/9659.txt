.@SenJohnMcCain on U. S airstrikes in Syria: “The president of the United States last night showed strength. ” pic. twitter.  Friday on Fox News Channel’s “America’s Newsroom,” Sen. John McCain ( ) praised President Donald Trump for the missile strike on Syria in response to that country’s alleged use of chemical weapons.  McCain said,  “I would not expect more strikes, but I would hope that we would reinvigorate our support for the Free Syrian Army, the establishment of a   zone, and move forward. This is important, and it is an important signal, but it is the beginning of a departure from the failed policies of the last eight years, and you’re not going to repair that overnight. ” “The other point that I would like to make really quick is that the President showed me that he has trust in what I believe is the strongest national security team assembled,” he continued. “I was not sure, frankly, whether he listened to them or listened to others. I think it is very clear that he values their advice and counsel, and this action is a result of the collective wisdom of some of the wisest people I have known. ” Follow Pam Key on Twitter @pamkeyNEN
