[Trump recalled the debate last Saturday, saying, “The room was stacked with special interests and lobbyists. ” He explained it was filled with the heads of drug companies and electric companies, adding, “That was the richest audience I think I’ve ever seen. ”  Trump, who was booed repeatedly during Saturday night’s debate as well as Sen. Ted Cruz ( ) said that to a certain extent, it’s “the RNC’s fault,” adding, “so I called them out. ” “I’m honored to represent you people,” Trump told his audience, reminding them that he’s the only candidate   his campaign and putting up his own money. “I walk on stage everyone is very quiet  …    it’s sort of wild,” Trump recalled of the debate audience. “Don’t forget, I was on the other side of the equation before June 16th,” the real estate mogul said about donating to various politicians as a business owner in the past before officially launching his presidential campaign. Roughly 1, 000 of the 1, 600 tickets from Saturday night’s debate went to the RNC and the South Carolina Republican Party, according to the RNC’s Sean Spicer.
