Democrats and even some fellow Republicans have disparaged him as a racist over his pledge to enforce the country’s immigration laws. Following the San Bernardino terrorist attacks, Trump proposed a temporary ban on Muslim immigration into the United States, citing the “great hatred towards Americans by large segments of the Muslim population. ” Trump stated that “until we are able to determine and understand this problem and the dangerous threat it poses, our country cannot be the victims of horrendous attacks by people that believe only in Jihad and have no sense of reason or respect for human life. ” Trump’s star was previously vandalized last September, when someone drew a yellow X across it.
