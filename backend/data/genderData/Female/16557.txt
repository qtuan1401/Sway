Late Night host Stephen Colbert slammed Donald Trump in a radio interview, calling the Republican White House hopeful a “coward” for failing to come back on his   show. [“I would have him on tomorrow, but he’s a coward,” Colbert said in a short soundbite from an interview on SiriusXM’s “The Bill Carter Interview. ”  “It’s clear that Donald Trump is a coward because he won’t come back on the show,” Colbert added. “He’s a chicken,” Colbert said in the interview, set to air in full on Monday, October 3.  The last time Trump was a guest on Colbert’s show was in September, 2015. He also called into the Late Show in February of this year. The CBS star also said “there’s never been a general election like this before,” citing the newspaper USA Today’s   weekly editorials. “USA Today for God’s sake. The thing that gets slipped underneath your door. The cartoon page masquerading as a newspaper says totally unqualified,” Colbert said. “We’re not saying vote for Hillary, just don’t vote for him. I’ve never seen that before. There isn’t really a bifurcation. ” Colbert also defended his   rival and Tonight Show host Jimmy Fallon, who recently came under fire for what critics charged was a “softball” interview with Trump in September. “Every host’s responsibility is to be honest with themselves and with their audience about the kind of show that they do. So I fault no host who acts consistently and honestly,” Colbert said, adding, however, that he makes it a point to “ask at least one question of some kind of substance with your guest. ” Although Trump has been absent from Colbert’s show, the real estate mogul has still been the butt of the   host’s jokes. In July, Colbert appeared at the Republican National Convention dressed as a character from the Hunger Games franchise to mock Trump. Colbert is set to host a live   special on Showtime on November 8.   Follow Jerome Hudson on Twitter: @JeromeEHudson
