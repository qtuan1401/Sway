A thief has been targeting the audience of the Broadway show Hamilton, police said. [Police say the serial pickpocketer has been lurking through crowds of fans waiting outside to meet the stars of the play, the New York Daily News reported.  The thief has stolen from these theatergoers waiting outside the Richard Rogers Theater six times in the past six months. Police say she started her spree on May 25 and most recently pickpocketed someone on Nov. 6. She then used the credit cards of those she pickpocketed to buy $2, 200 worth of items at Macy’s, Junior’s Restaurant, Rite Aid, Target, DSW, Burlington Coat Factory, and Duane Reade. Police describe the thief as a black woman with black hair and glasses. She was last seen wearing a black jacket, a grey sweater, black pants and a gray scarf. The musical has attracted many politicians to the show, including President Obama, Hillary Clinton, and Vice   Mike Pence. The cast in a recent performance of the show gave Pence an   lecture about how a “diverse America” is “alarmed and anxious” about the upcoming Trump administration. Pence said that he was not offended by the cast’s message, but   Donald Trump called on the cast to apologize to Pence after the lecture and Trump supporters immediately called for a boycott of the show on social media. “Hamilton” actor Brandon Victor Dixon said there was “nothing to apologize for” in lecturing Pence.
