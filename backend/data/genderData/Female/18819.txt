David Bossie, chairman of the Super PAC Defeat Crooked Hillary, is responding to FBI director James Comey’s announcement that the FBI won’t recommend criminal charges against presumptive Democratic nominee Hillary Clinton’s for her use of a private email server during her time as Secretary of State. [“Despite an extensive investigation acknowledging Secretary Clinton was ‘careless’ and ‘reckless’ in her use of a private email server as Secretary of State, the F. B. I. has recommended not pursuing charges against Clinton. Fortunately, the American people still have a chance to render a final judgment on Election Day against crooked Hillary Clinton,” Bossie said in a statement on Tuesday afternoon.  He continued, “Hillary Clinton is a serial liar who has a trust problem with American voters, and despite the F. B. I. ’s bad decision today, this is not the first, nor the last, scandal that disqualifies Hillary Clinton from serving as our nation’s President. ” The Defeat Crooked Hillary Super PAC was launched for donors who wish to defeat Clinton, but do not want to publicly support Trump.
