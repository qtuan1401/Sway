Residents of   the Lone Star State  recent as   March 2016. ’ ’   One big obstacle: The US Constitution lays out procedures for how   a new state may enter the union, but there are no protocols for a   nation to exit. ’ ’   ”There’’s no legal path to secession,” Cynthia Nicoletti, an    and   author of the upcoming book, ”The Treason Trial of Jefferson   Davis: Secession in the Aftermath of the Civil War,”   told Business Insider last year. ’ ’   Shortly after Barack Obama was   to the presidency in   2012, disgruntled Texans  asking that the   administration ”peacefully grant” the state the right to withdraw   from the union. It racked up over 125, 000 signatures. The   director of the White House Office of Public Engagement, Jon   Carson, dashed their dreams in his response. ’ ’   Carson wrote that our founding fathers established in the US   Constitution ”the right to change our national government . .. But   they did not provide a right to walk away from it.” ’ ’  ’ ’   That leaves two paths, according to Nicoletti. ”You’’re going to   need a constitutional amendment or you’’re going to need a   revolution,” she said. ’ ”   In 1861, Texas rallied with 10 other southern states to leave the   union and form the Confederate States of America. It didn’t turn   out as they hoped, needless to say. About 700, 000 people died in   the Civil War, and by 1870, all 11 states rejoined the US. ” ’   According to a significant case argued before the US Supreme   Court in 1869, they never had the right to exit in the first   place. ’ ”   Nicoletti, a legal historian who said she was surprised to find   her subject of expertise relevant once again, explains that while   the issue of a state’s legal right to secede may have played out   on the battlefield when the North defeated the South, Texas v.   White made it crystal clear that individual states could not just   leave  —   even if agreed upon by a majority of Texans. ” ’   Still, ”saying that something is illegal is not the same as   saying it’’s impossible,” Nicoletti said. ’ ’   A state can pass a constitutional amendment that legalizes   secession with a vote from other 49 states. However, Fusion  that amending the Constitution ”is a feat difficult   enough that it has happened only 17 times in 227 years.” ’ ’  ’ ”   The Yes California Independence Campaign, the political action   committee leading the Calexit charge, is currently gathering   signatures to put a measure on the ballot in 2019 that would   allow Californians to voice their support for a departure from   the US. If at least half of registered voters show up at the   polls for that vote, and at least 55% vote in favor of   secession, the results would serve as the state’s declaration of   independence, the . ” ’   If it passes, which is highly implausible, the group may do a few   things. ’ ’   A member of the California federal delegation could go to   Washington, DC, and propose an amendment to the US Constitution   that would permit the state to bounce the union. ’ ’   Alternatively, California could call for a convention of the   states and the amendment granting California its independence   could be voted upon by the delegates to the convention. ’ ’   Either option ends with a call for congressional approval.   Nicoletti said the chances Calexit succeeds are slim to none, and   the potential consequences are grim. ’ ’   ”The last time [a state seceded] the consequence was the Union   Army,” Nicolleti said. ”Do I think that there will be troops in   the center of San Francisco?
