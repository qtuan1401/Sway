Welcome to Breitbart News’s live updates of the 2016 election. Donald Trump lays out his economic vision in New York while Hillary Clinton returns to the campaign trail in North Carolina.  All times eastern.  —   10:20: Trump on Fallon: Trump lets Jimmy Fallon mess up his hair https:  .  https:  .   —   CNN Politics (@CNNPolitics) September 16, 2016,  10:10: Has anything good happened after the Washington Post interviews Trump? And yet (Is Trump’s favorite football player DeSean Jackson?)  …     And Trump’s campaign forced to release this statement that will bigfoot his economic message and all of the negative headlines about Clinton: “Hillary Clinton’s campaign first raised this issue to smear   Barack Obama in her very nasty, failed 2008 campaign for President. This type of vicious and conniving behavior is straight from the Clinton Playbook. As usual, however, Hillary Clinton was too weak to get an answer. Even the MSNBC show Morning Joe admits that it was Clinton’s henchmen who first raised this issue, not Donald J. Trump. In 2011, Mr. Trump was finally able to bring this ugly incident to its conclusion by successfully compelling President Obama to release his birth certificate. Mr. Trump did a great service to the President and the country by bringing closure to the issue that Hillary Clinton and her team first raised. Inarguably, Donald J. Trump is a closer. Having successfully obtained President Obama’s birth certificate when others could not, Mr. Trump believes that President Obama was born in the United States. Mr. Trump is now totally focused on bringing jobs back to America, defeating radical Islamic terrorism, taking care of our veterans, introducing school choice opportunities and rebuilding and making our inner cities safe again. ” 10:08: . @HillaryClinton  @POTUS visited for about 15 minutes this evening in DC before her remarks at Congressional Hispanic Caucus Institute Gala,  —   Kylie Atwood (@kylieatwood) September 16, 2016,  9:05: Clinton is blasting what she says are Trump’s “racist” attacks against minorities. She says we need to “stop him conclusively in November” in an election that “sends a message that even he can hear. ” 8:59: Clinton keeps talking about defending those who have received Obama’s executive amnesty. Even when she is talking about this   issue, the audience does not seem that enthusiastic, at least now as much as they were for Obama. 8:57: Clinton again promises amnesty legislation within the first 100 days if she gets elected. She says it will “keep families together” and include a “path to citizenship” for illegals. 8:53: Clinton says during Hispanic heritage month, students will study Dolores Huerta and Julian and Joaquin Castro. She also mentions Laurie Hernandez and Roberto Clemente. She also speaks about   and those whose families have been here “before the United States even existed. ” Clinton says “you’re not strangers” and “intruders” 8:47: Clinton says it’s so great to see “young people” at the gala. She desperately needs young minority voters who are not enthusiastic about her candidacy. She says we’re at a “pivotal moment” in the nation’s history for Latinos. She slams Trump’s “outlandish” and “offensive” comments. She says Obama is a tough act to follow in “more ways than one. ” Clinton has now been at the CHCI gala venue for about 10 minutes. Obama is also still here. Likely they will cross paths.  —   Abby D. Phillip (@abbydphillip) September 16, 2016,  8:43: Rep.

He again says he’s running to be the president of the United States of America and not the president of the world. He speaks about his plans to reduce poverty for   and Hispanic communities. He tells the Hispanic community that he will protect their jobs, build up their schools, and give them safety, which also means protecting them from radical Islamic terrorism. He says it’s time to rebuild our inner cities before we allow refugees from all over the world from entering. 8:12: Trump says while Clinton slanders Americans as “deplorables,” he calls them   American people who love their country and families. He is citing Bernie Sanders’s comments about Clinton’s “bad judgment” and slams her for not taking responsibility for the rise of ISIS. 8:06: In New Hampshire, Trump says he has some “good news. ” He says the press is stuck on an airplane and will be about 30 minutes late. He says they asked if he could wait and he said he wouldn’t. “Let’s get going,” Trump says. He cites his good poll numbers, which can decline just as quickly if decides to say random things that distract from his message, and says he was right about how companies like Ford are leaving the United States. Trump says his support comes from all regions and from all walks of life and he’s running to be president of all Americans. 8:03: Obama denouncing the politics of “anger” and “vitriol” without mentioning Trump. He says some are talking about what the “real America looks like” and “it only includes a few of  us. ” “Who’s going to decide what the real America is?” he asks. Obama says we can’t let that brand of politics win.

She says “her senior staff knew” and “information was provided to a number of people. ” Did she tell Kaine? Not clear as always from her legalese answer. Another Clintonian answer that makes people dislike her so much.

Clinton says, “like a lot of women,” she has a “tendency to  . ” She says she won’t be the “showman” that Trump is.

She said having a few days to herself was actually a gift. She says the campaign trail doesn’t encourage “reflection” and being at home helped her “reconnect” with what the campaign is about. She says when people like her are under the weather, she can take a few days off but millions of Americans cannot. She is now speaking about insurance that is “too expensive” for them to actually use. [Wasn’t Obamacare supposed to take care of that?] [Trump is speaking to voters to “connect. ”] 3:30: Trump within margin of error in MICHIGAN poll.

The more Clinton is in the news, the better Trump’s poll numbers get, as last week showed.   I am fairly certain DJT Jr. ”warming up the gas chamber” comment was probably unintentional, but not best optics https:  .   —   Alana Abramson (@aabramson) September 15, 2016,  When Hillary Clinton retweets an independent candidate who is MAYBE on ballot in 20% of states pic. twitter.   —   Alana Abramson (@aabramson) September 15, 2016,  . @ADL_National calls on @DonaldJTrumpJr to retract gas chamber comments.

Calls it ”sacred.  —   Sara Murray (@SaraMurray) September 15, 2016,  12:37: Trump asked about offsets, and he says that his plan will work out over time. He says the big things re: neutrality is the amount of revenue his plan will generate and the companies that will not leave the country. Trump pivots to companies like Ford leaving the country because taxes are so high and suffocating regulations. He also talks about cutting budgetary costs. Trump also says we need to be compensated for defending countries like Saudi Arabia. He says, “I’m sure they will be thrilled to hear that. ” Trump wonders if Saudi Arabia would even exist if we didn’t defend the nation. 12:36: Trump now being interviewed after his speech. Trump talking about his 15% corporate tax rate and how much waste that needs to be cut. Trump talks about a “politically motivated” military that doesn’t buy the generals the equipment that they want and need that probably costs less than some of the wasteful spending that is being done now. 12:35: Man comes out to clear prompters off stage. ”What happened with the teleprompters man?” Trump joked. ”Hey he’s a little late right?”  —   Ali Vitali (@alivitali) September 15, 2016,  12:31: Media “analysts” seem hysterical about Trump’s economic plan. [Translation: They know his   will resonate with Middle America  …     the more the “experts” are agitated, the better Trump probably did.] 12:30: Trump now also gaining on Clinton in Virginia, a state that many pundits had written off. 12:26: Trump promises to only negotiate trade deals that will put American workers first. He now talks about rebuilding the country’s infrastructure. “American hands will rebuild this nation,” he says, echoing what he said last night in Ohio. “American workers will be hired to do the job. ” 12:25: Trump again promises that Mexico will pay for the wall. He says the wall is “peanuts” compared to our massive trade deficit with Mexico. 12:19: Trump says he will renegotiate NAFTA or terminate it until a better deal can be signed. He slams China as a “grand master” currency manipulator and vows to impose tariffs on those who manipulate their currency. Trump says just enforcing intellectual property rules will also create plenty of American jobs. Trump promises to stop the “outflow” of jobs from American and open up a “new highway” that will bring jobs back. Trump speaking about “dynamic growth models” and says his economic plan is the most   plan in the history of the country. 12:17: Trump says many of the special interests funding Clinton’s campaign favor terrible trade deals while the   “experts” advising her were in favor of disastrous deals like NAFTA. He says all of these special interests and experts have been proven wrong but the media leap at the chance to interview them regardless. Trump says our manufacturing base has crumbled and households are making less today than in 2000. 12:10: Trump slams needless and   regulations and proposes a “moratorium” on regulations that “are not compelled by Congress or public safety. ” He says he will eliminate all needless and   regulations on the books, “and there are plenty of them. ” He speaks of various environmental regulations that will shut down   plants. Trump reminds the audience that Clinton wants to shut down miners and steel workers and “we’re not going to let it happen. ” ”I know that’s what you people have been waiting for”  —   Trump, to applauding CEOs, upon announcing his corp tax rate cut from 35% to 15%.  —   Carl Quintanilla (@carlquintanilla) September 15, 2016,  12:01: Trump says “just look at the math, it works. ” He says his economic plan will result in 3. 5% annual growth. He is now speaking about his bold tax reform plan that will exempt millions from paying taxes until they start to earn enough to do so. His plan, he says, will offer tax relief to   Americans along with his childcare plan. Trump says people earning $5 million, “like the people in this room,” won’t see their taxes change that much and won’t get much of a break. Trump says under his plan, people making, for example, $5 million  —   like the people in this room  —   don’t get a new income tax break (1)  —   Celeste Katz (@CelesteKatzNYC) September 15, 2016,  He promises an “explosion” of growth and vows that wealth that is parked overseas will also be brought back under his plan. “We’ll bring it back and it will only be taxed at the rate of 10% instead of 35%,” he says. “It’s going to be something that will be so phenomenal  …     far beyond what people even think. ” Trump says his tax plan will favor the middle class that built this country “and we will not forget. ”   11:58: Trump says the   people Clinton calls “deplorables” are the “most admirable people” he knows, including cops, teachers, blacks, whites, Latinos. He says, above all, they are Americans who love their families and country and want a better future. He says “these are the forgotten men and women”  of this country who don’t have a voice. “I’m running to be their voice,” he says. 11:56: Trump says only donors will prosper under Clinton because she doesn’t have ideas that will create American jobs. He says the only thing Clinton’s plan can offer “is a welfare check, that’s it. ” 11:55: Trump says that instead of driving jobs and wealth away, America will be a great magnet for jobs. He says Clinton rejects this optimism and offers more taxes, regulation, and wealth redistribution that will lead to a future of slow growth, declining income, and dwindling opportunities. 11:54: Trump is now praising himself for being able to read from a TelePrompter ”Who else could pull that off?”  —   Leigh Ann Caldwell (@LACaldwellDC) September 15, 2016,  [Bill Clinton gave part of his State of the Union address when the wrong speech was loaded in Teleprompter. Trump needs to stop making    comments that can make him seem ridiculous. Last night, he said he’s working harder so he doesn’t feel sorry for Americans who are working harder and earning less. Another stupid    comment that only gives more ammunition to his opponents.] Trump re dealing with Teleprompter issues: ”who else could have pulled that off?” Answer: Bill Clinton 1993 speech https:  .   —   Chris Donovan (@chrisdonovan) September 15, 2016,  11:53: Trump says everything that is broken today can be fixed. 11:52: Trump says his economic plan rejects the “cynicism” that says our labor force will keep declining and the pessimism that says our “standard of living can no longer rise. ” Trump says today’s economy is one of “no growth and redistribution of wealth. And that’s not going to work. ” 11:50: At the Economic Club in New York, Trump first cites his great poll numbers that have clearly put him in a great mood. Trump speaks to the “silent nation of jobless Americans” and says it’s “disgraceful” that politicians allow companies like Ford get away with moving all of its production of small cars to Mexico.
