’  ’ ’   Neil Gorsuch, the 10th Circuit Court of Appeals judge nominated   by President Donald Trump to the vacant Supreme Court seat last   week, said Wednesday he was ”disheartened” by the president   attempting to delegitimize a federal judge. ’ ”   Gorsuch made the comment during a meeting with Sen. Richard   Blumenthal, a Connecticut Democrat, as he seeks Senate   confirmation. Blumenthal told reporters of Gorsuch’s   remarks, which were confirmed to Business Insider by a   spokesperson for the Supreme Court nomination team. ” ’   ”He said very specifically that they were demoralizing and   disheartening and he characterized them very specifically that   way,” Blumenthal said, . ”I said they were more than   disheartening and I said to him that he has an obligation to make   his views clear to the American people, so they understand how   abhorrent or unacceptable President Trump’’s attacks on the   judiciary are.” ’ ’   The comments in question included  where Trump called US   District Judge James Robart  —   appointed by President George W.   Bush  —   a ” ” judge. Robart issued a nationwide stay on   parts of Trump’’s controversial executive order temporarily   barring travel into the United States from seven majority Muslim   nations identified as hot spots for terror, in addition to   suspending all refugee entry. ’ ’   Trump later suggested that, should any terror attacks occur   while the stay was issued on the travel ban, the judge should be   blamed. Critics of his remarks said the president was seeking to   undermine the independence of the judiciary. ’ ”   The stay issued by Robart on parts of Trump’s executive order is   now being reviewed by the 9th Circuit Court of Appeals. On   Tuesday, both the State of Washington and the Department of   Justice presented their cases before a   panel. ” ’Neil Gorsuch, the 10th Circuit Court of Appeals. ..’
