Rapper and former House of Pain frontman Everlast tore into Donald Trump on Monday, ordering the GOP presidential frontrunner to stop using his hit 90s song “Jump Around” at campaign events and even threatening physical violence against him. [In a series of Twitter messages, the    rapper wrote that he would send a cease and desist letter to Trump if the “scumbag” continued to play his hit song at rallies.  Hey @realDonaldTrump stop using my song jump around at your rallies you piece of shit. Cease and desist is coming you scumbag.  —   Mr. Whitefolks (@OGEverlast) April 5, 2016,  The rapper also threatened the candidate with physical violence, and posted a link to the YG and Nipsey Hustle’s latest rap song, “F —  k Donald Trump. ” Hey @realDonaldTrump I’ll smack the fucking combover off of your disgusting moronic scalp you P. OS. #fuckdonaldtrump,  —   Mr. Whitefolks (@OGEverlast) April 5, 2016,  Everlast (real name Erik Francis Schrody) apparently angered Trump supporters on the social media site, following up with a message saying he was “honored to have pissed you off. ” All @realDonaldTrump supporters talking shit I’m honored to have pissed you off. Keep supporting your racist lying dipshit of a candidate.  —   Mr. Whitefolks (@OGEverlast) April 5, 2016,  Aww I pissed off all the racists. 😂😂😂😂😂😂😂  —   Mr. Whitefolks (@OGEverlast) April 5, 2016,  the real fucked up part is this election is the realist example of the lesser of evils.

Still #FDT,  —   Mr. Whitefolks (@OGEverlast) April 5, 2016,   If I’m going to vote for a person w zero experience and that thinks everything is a big joke here’s my nominee   …     #FUCKDONALDTRUMP, A photo posted by #EVERLAST (@ogeverlast) on Apr 4, 2016 at 8:13pm PDT,  It’s so much fun laughing at the geniuses on my timeline. Lots of hurt feelings amongst the racist, reality TV  comb over loving crowd. 😂😂  —   Mr. Whitefolks (@OGEverlast) April 5, 2016,  In a subsequent   interview with Billboard, Everlast said the Trump campaign had deliberately picked his music for rallies in order to appear “cool. ” “That’s   man, that is black culture  —   what the f —  k do you think you’re doing with it?” the rapper, who is white, told the outlet, adding: “He’s a f —  ing racist piece of s —  t. That’s what he’s trying to do: One of the most   white   groups  …     they’re not stupid, the people around him. They’re trying to create these inroads to people’s demographic cubbyholes, so they can be like, ‘Yeah, we’re down with  . Yeah, we’re f —  ing cool.’ F —  k that dude. I’ll smack that f —  ker’s   right off his f —  ing scalp. Like, for real, if I met Donald Trump, I’d punch him in his f —  ing face. And that’s not a joke. Even if he did become president  —   watch out, Donald Trump, because I will punch you in your f —  ing face if I ever meet you. Secret Service had better just f —  ing be on it. Don’t let me anywhere within a block. This is horrible. ” Of course, there is a long history of musicians ordering politicians they disagree with to stop using their music at public events. In June, Neil Young told off the Trump campaign for using his hit song “Rockin’ in the Free World” during his presidential campaign kickoff announcement in Manhattan. Earlier last year, Celtic punk band Dropkick Murphys ordered Wisconsin Gov. Scott Walker to stop using their song “I’m Shipping Up to Boston” at campaign events, because they “literally hate” him.
