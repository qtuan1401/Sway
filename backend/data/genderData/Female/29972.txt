WASHINGTON, DC  —   House Freedom Caucus chairman Rep. Jim Jordan tells Breitbart News that he believes the Republican Party will unify around its nominee Donald Trump in order to defeat Hillary Clinton in November. [“I think we’ll all come together. I really do,” Jordan told Breitbart News, referring to efforts to bring the party together after a divisive primary battle.  “I’ve seen the evidence” from the Benghazi Commission that showed Hillary Clinton saying one thing and doing another with regard to the Benghazi terrorist attack, including blaming a YouTube video for the   violence. “That’s the kind of thing we have to underscore,” Jordan said. “Their likely nominee is Secretary Clinton. That’s what we’ve got to focus on. ” Jordan chairs the   “Freedom Caucus,” an organization of conservative House members who fight to push the party in the Right direction on policy issues, including federal government spending. The primary contest first pitted Establishment candidates like Jeb Bush and Marco Rubio against conservatives and then split the conservative movement during a   war between Donald Trump and Ted Cruz. Some Republican consultants and activists are still pledging support for the #NeverTrump movement and vowing either not to vote or to support Hillary Clinton in the general election. But Trump has made up some ground by meeting with House Speaker Paul Ryan and Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell. Trump and Ryan released a joint statement that suggested the two would work together during the general election, though Ryan chose not to formally endorse Trump.
