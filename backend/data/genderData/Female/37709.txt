 (CNN) Here is a look at the Supreme Court of the United States.

February 2, 1790   The first court assembles in New York City. Nine justices comprise the US Supreme Court, one chief justice and eight associate justices. The number of associate justices may be fixed by Congress and under the authority of the act of June 25, 1948 (28 U. S. C. 1). The president of the United States nominates candidates for the Supreme Court. They must be approved by the US Senate.
