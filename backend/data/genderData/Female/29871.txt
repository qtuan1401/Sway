Republican nominee Donald Trump is seeing a   bump with female voters  —   a demographic he was lagging with in comparison to the 2008 and 2012 GOP nominees. [A Morning Consult survey taken over the course of six weeks from June through July showed only about 36 percent of women supported Trump. However, a   poll taken last weekend following the Republican National Convention (RNC) gave Trump a bump with females. Support from women jumped to 42 percent for the billionaire.  Prior to the RNC, independent women supported Hillary Clinton over Trump 33 percent to 31 percent. After the convention, independent women support Trump over Clinton 37 percent to 30 percent. In 2008 and 2012, 43 percent of women supported the Republican nominee.
