Tuesday on Fox Business Network, billionaire Dallas Mavericks owner Mark Cuban, a supporter of Democratic presidential nominee Hillary Clinton, told host Neil Cavuto he expected the markets to fall if Republican presidential nominee Donald Trump is elected president this fall.  “I have my Trump hedge on,” Cuban said. “In the event Donald wins, I have no doubt in my mind the market tanks. ” Cuban cited the uncertainty about Trump’s policies as the reason for the potential market reaction. “We don’t know what Donald Trump’s plans are. Right now all we know are a little bit about his immigration, which tends to change on a day to day basis, and we know he’s going to reduce taxes significantly. ” “The bottom line is, of all the things we can discuss, the one things the markets hate is uncertainty, and right now with Donald there’s uncertainty. ” Follow Jeff Poor on Twitter @jeff_poor
