Tuesday on MSNBC’s “Morning Joe,” host Joe Scarborough reacted to a NBC   Monkey poll showing Republican voters trusting presumptive Republican presidential nominee Donald Trump to lead the party over Speaker of the House Paul Ryan ( ).   According to Scarborough that shows the GOP is now the party of Trump. “A couple of things are jumping out at me,” Scarborough said. “First of all, this is not Paul Ryan’s party anymore. This is Donald Trump’s party. It has nothing to do with Donald Trump. It has  a lot to do where the Republican Party has gone the past 20 to 30 years. Working class voters feel disconnected from Washington, DC, especially Washington, DC Republicans who they feel like they let them down. Let them down not only when they ran the deficit and the debt up during the Bush years, but also they elected the Tea Partiers in 2010 to get rid of ObamaCare and do other great things. It didn’t happen. 2014, the same thing happened. So that’s the first thing. This is not Paul Ryan’s party. Paul Ryan’s policies are not the policies that drive the Republican base anymore. They are more of a populist base of policies. ” Follow Jeff Poor on Twitter @jeff_poor
