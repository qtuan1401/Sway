Columnist Charles Krauthammer stated Republican presidential candidate and his supporters “are the victims” in the violence that broke out at one of his events in Chicago, and shouldn’t be blamed, but that it’s “really unconscionable” Trump wouldn’t condemn an attendee at another rally punching a demonstrator on Monday’s “Special Report” on the Fox News Channel.  Krauthammer said [relevant remarks begin around 2:30] “The one, obviously, what happened in Chicago, is organized, and this is the far left, also the far right, we saw it in the 20s and the 30s, the tactic of shutting the opposition down, and it isn’t only something happening in presidential politics. This is happening on campus all the time. Speakers who aren’t allowed to speak, outside of the Trumps and the others. We’re just talking about the norm on campus, which is that, the left acts in a totalitarian way to control who speaks. That’s a phenomenon. It should be condemned, and then Trump, and the supporters, who are the victims here, are not to be blamed. ” He continued, “There’s a second phenomenon. Which is other events which are happening in Trump events, and you get  …    Trump winking and nodding saying, you know, in the old days he’d be carried them in a stretcher, meaning, we used to beat people like that until they were unable to walk. We saw on tape, a guy hitting,   a demonstrator, in the face, and saying, if we see him again, we may have to kill him. That’s lynch talk. And when asked about it, Trump said, ‘I don’t condone it.’ That’s great. But he refused to condemn it. And that I think is really unconscionable. ” Krauthammer further said it was “even worse” that Trump was considering paying the legal fees of the man who punched the demonstrator.
