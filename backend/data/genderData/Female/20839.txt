National Journal Senior Political Columnist Ron Fournier argued that Democratic presidential candidate former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton’s “biggest impediment really is the FBI primary” and characterized the “very likely”   general election as one between “two of the most untrustworthy, disliked, most polarizing candidates in our lifetime” during the Fox News Channel’s coverage of the South Carolina Democratic primary on Saturday.  Fournier said [relevant remarks begin around 2:10] “This race is now hers to lose. Her biggest impediment really is the FBI primary. Whatever comes out of the investigation, if anything.   …     So, unless something really big changes, she’s going to be the nominee. ” Columnist Charles Krauthammer agreed, adding, “The only thing that’s going to stop her is going to be the Comey primary, he’s head of the FBI. If there’s a criminal referral, that’s the lightning strike that would elevate somebody like a [Democratic candidate Senator Bernie] Sanders ( ). ” Fournier later stated, “[W]e’re very likely to have a general election fight between Trump and Hillary Clinton, two of the most untrustworthy, disliked, most polarizing candidates in our lifetime. ” Follow Ian Hanchett on Twitter @IanHanchett
