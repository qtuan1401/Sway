Sunday on CNN’s “State of the Union With Jake Tapper,” former Massachusetts governor and current vice presidential nominee on the Libertarian party ticket William Weld said the presumptive Republican presidential nominee Donald Trump’s immigration policy is like the infamous Kristallnacht night of the Holocaust.  Partial transcript as follows:  TAPPER: Let’s talk about immigration. You’ve differed with Donald Trump sharply on this issue of mass deportation, his plan to deport the estimated 11 million or 12 million undocumented immigrants in the U. S. You told The New York Times about that plan, ‘I can hear the glass crunching on Kristallnacht in the ghettos of Warsaw and Vienna when I hear that.’ Kristallnacht or crystal night in English from the Holocaust, the shards of broken glass that littered the streets after   stores, businesses and synagogues had their windows smashed by angry   mobs. Is that a little strong, you think, to talk about the Holocaust? WELD: No, no. I don’t think so. I served five years on the U. S. Holocaust Commission by appointment of President George W. Bush and by the way, Israel never had a stronger friend in the White House, and I’m  —   that was my request, and I’m absolutely certain that as we said in those years, if we don’t remember, we absolutely will forget. And you got to forget a lot of things to think it’s a good idea to round up and depart 1 million people living peaceably, most of them working in America, in the middle of the night. No, not the United States. China maybe, not the United States. Follow Pam Key on Twitter @pamkeyNEN
