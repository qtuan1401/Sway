Friday on MSNBC, Rep. Sheila Jackson Lee ( ) said, “This race is very close. I think we’re going to make history in Texas, and frankly, I think we’re going to be in the column for Hillary Rodham Clinton. ”  Jackson Lee said, “Let me say that I’m very proud of The Dallas Morning News among many other papers in the state of Texas, but I’m very proud of my fellow it Texans. This race is very close. I think we’re going to make history in Texas, and frankly, I think we’re going to be in the column for Hillary Rodham Clinton. I think the real issue is what you have raised. Anyone who has said our generals who are sacrificing their, if you will  —   their lives   —   willing to put their lives on the line and to attack them and say they’re in rubble, anyone who refuses to call Russia what it is, an aggressor, that has stolen land from another country, Crimea, that is threatening Georgia, that won’t sit down with the president of the United States to resolve Syria, that is actually bombing parts of Aleppo or supporting those who aren’t, losing lives. All of this, as a member of the Homeland Security Committee, one who is here on   frightens me. And it frightens the American people. And it frightens them because of the lack of judgment and temperament and the willingness to say anything without acknowledging the fact that words on the international arena, diplomacy, matter. I don’t think Mr. Trump understands that. ” Follow Pam Key on Twitter @pamkeyNEN
