During GOP frontrunner Donald Trump’s campaign rally Saturday morning in Dayton, Ohio, it appears someone tried to grab the real estate mogul from behind while he was speaking on stage. [Several Secret Service officials jumped into action and surrounded Trump.   The crowd began chanting, “Trump!” and “  !   !” “Thank you for the warning. I was ready for him, but it’s much easier if the cops do it, don’t we agree. What a great job!” Trump said. Trump then said it’s payback time and time to make America great again. The billionaire appeared to be uninjured and continued to speak.
