ASHBURN, Va.  —   Silent protesters. A group in AARP shirts. A crying baby. They all ended up having to leave Donald J. Trump’s rally in Virginia on Tuesday, for various reasons. The silent protesters were escorted out by staff members midway through his speech, and they went silently, with peace signs over their heads. The   group left in a similar fashion. But the crying baby was initially welcome in the event, or so the crowd was led to believe. “Don’t worry about that baby. I love babies,” Mr. Trump said. “I hear that baby crying, I like it. What a baby, what a beautiful baby. Don’t worry, don’t worry. ” But the platitudes did nothing to comfort the infant, whose persistent wails seemed to be getting on the candidate’s nerves. “Actually, I was only kidding. You can get that baby out of here,” Mr. Trump said a few beats later with a slight smirk as laughs and a few gasps escaped from the crowd. “Don’t worry, I think she really believed me that I love having a baby crying while I’m speaking. That’s O. K. People don’t understand. That’s O. K. ” Later in the rally, another baby cried, daring a rebuke from the candidate. But eventually the child calmed down. Senator Tim Kaine, the Democratic   nominee, was swift to pick up on Mr. Trump’s baby episode, taking a jab at him as he brought up the issue of prekindergarten at a rally in Daytona Beach, Fla. on Tuesday. “I saw that Donald Trump kicked a crying baby out of an event earlier today,” Mr. Kaine said, “so as I’m thinking about   sometimes you wonder who the baby is. ”
