Roll Call columnist Jonathan Allen, during Saturday’s “Who Won the Week” segment on MSNBC’s “AM Joy,” awarded Hillary Clinton’s running mate Sen. Tim Kaine ( ) as his winner of the week after Kaine compared Donald Trump and his supporters to slave owners at a Florida AM University rally Friday.  Allen noted how Kaine brought up abolitionist Frederick Douglass’ newspaper, The North Star, and said Kaine was comparing Trump and his supporters to slave owners. “He was comparing Donald trump and his supporters to slave owners, which you would think the RNC and Donald Trump would be even more angry about had they been able to hear it,” Allen stated.
