Facing a   fight in a Colorado swing district, Republican Rep. Mike Coffman is slamming both major party candidates for President, Donald Trump and Hillary Clinton, in a new campaign ad released in both English and Spanish. [“Honestly, I don’t care for him much,” that’s the response Coffman gives in the new ad when asked about the Republican Party’s presidential nominee. “And I certainly don’t trust Hillary,” he says of Democratic Party nominee Clinton.  While calls continue on both sides of the aisle for party members to unite, Coffman is actively distancing himself from his own party’s nominee. He expressed deep offense over Trump’s comments on the    Khan family. Coffman promotes his experience as a U. S. Marine:“For me, country comes first. ” He was one of 20 Republicans who voted with Democrats against the Brooks amendment to the National Defense Authorization Act in May 2015. The amendment passed despite the move and stripped language inserted with Rep. Ruben Gallego ( )’s amendment. Gallego’s amendment would have allowed illegal aliens under President Barack Obama’s DACA (Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals) to enlist in the U. S. military. Coffman joined with  . Eric Cantor ( ) and Rep. Jeff Denham ( ) in a 2014 behind the scenes effort to move forward a proposal like Gallego’s. Breitbart News previously reported on the effort and how Cantor shortly thereafter lost his seat in the House of Representatives to Dave Brat. Brat had focused on Cantor’s support for amnesty measures in the primary election campaign that is believed to be “the first time in U. S. history a sitting House Majority Leader was beaten in a primary election. ” “If Donald Trump is the President, I’ll stand up to him, plain and simple,” says Colorado’s 6th District Representative in the new campaign ad. “If Hillary wins, I’ll hold her accountable, every step of the way. ”  Follow Michelle Moons on Twitter @MichelleDiana
