Hillary Clinton campaigned at an Pennsylvania area church Sunday morning, reminding attendees that the founders’ vision of America was initially imperfect. [“Here in America, when our founders said all men are created equal, well they left out African Americans, they left out women, they left out a lot of us, but that didn’t stop generations of Americans from pushing forward, making clear we were not satisfied with just half measures,” she said.  Clinton spoke from the pulpit to a largely African American congregation of Mount Airy Church of God in Christ, in Philadelphia. “We didn’t all get to vote, did we?” she said, lumping in women’s struggle for equality together with slavery. Clinton put her campaign for president in historical context, suggesting that her election would help move the country forward towards a “more perfect union. ” “We know the painful chapters of our past, but the greatness of our country lies in the willingness and our ability to right these wrongs,” she said. Her candidacy, she argued, was one dedicated to progress, while alluding that Trump’s campaign was about returning to a “dark and divisive” point in history. “I personally believe that we have come too far to turn back now,” she said.
