 (CNN) During more than a decade covering the Middle East, I’ve met and interviewed dozens of people from the region who have visas to the US.  They are students, family members of US citizens, businesspeople and tourists. They are not ”radical Islamic terrorists.” In fact, as my colleague Peter Bergen noted Saturday, every terror attack on US soil since   has been carried out by US citizens or US legal residents, not by visa holders or refugees.  Friday, I asked on Twitter for stories of those affected by President Donald Trump’s travel ban.  And I received numerous responses. Here are a few of them: Father weeps over the news, Son concerned over father’s travel plans, Student worried he won’t be able to see his family, Businessman who can’t travel for meetings, Doctor unable to attend conference, Father not able to see his children, Student’s education on hold, Friends unable to see family
