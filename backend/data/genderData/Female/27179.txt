A Villanova University student has asked police to drop their investigation into an incident in which she alleged she was attacked by white male   Donald Trump supporters. [An   female student at the university alleged in a hate   story that after Trump’s victory against Democratic nominee Hillary Clinton, a group of white men knocked her to the ground as they yelled “Trump,” Philly. com reported.  Last month, the student asked the local police department to shut down the investigation into the incident, yet police did not reveal the reason for her request. Villanova University campus police say the student is now asking them to drop the investigation into the alleged incident as well. “It was hard to move forward, being that the student did not want to pursue the matter,” a Villanova campus police spokesman told the local paper. The spokesman would not say why exactly the student would not cooperate with campus police and why she did not want to pursue the investigation. Similar stories brought to police by college students have ended with the student being charged for hoaxing hate crime complaints. In one incident, a Muslim student at the University of Lafayette in Louisiana filed a police report in which she said she was attacked by white male Trump supporters and had her hijab ripped from her head. The student fabricated the story and was subsequently charged for filing a fake police report, as Breitbart Texas reported. John Binder is a contributor for Breitbart Texas.
