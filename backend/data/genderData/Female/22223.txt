While all the other “strategists” gibbered about Trump losing the Hispanic vote, Marlow said: “Trump is growing the big tent.   …     Trump’s policies are appealing to blacks. There are even some polls out there, like a survey USA poll, saying Trump is actually doing fine with Latinos. ” In the Nevada primary on Tuesday, Trump not only won the Hispanic vote he not only won 17 points more of the Hispanic vote than his next closest rival but his Latino vote nearly matched that of the two Latino candidates combined. In one of the few times you might have heard this point expressed on television airwaves, Marlow said that the No. 1 issue for Breitbart News’ 20 million readers, “has consistently been  —   since last year  —   immigration. They are looking for someone who is going to seal the border and prioritize border security as No. 1. ” Obviously, Marlow was right about everything. According to Nexis, that was the last time he appeared on TV. It would be as if, after discovering America, Christopher Columbus reported back to the King and Queen of Spain, but the booker for Ferdinand and Isabella decided that, instead of Columbus, she’d get the guy who never actually set sail for the New World because he was afraid he’d fall off the edge of the Earth into a fiery pit. Fantastic  —   that’s great. You’re going to be our   expert on the discovery of the New World. Can you be here early Sunday morning? 5:24: Rep. Clyburn predicts a “comfortable win” for Clinton in South Carolina in an interview with MSNBC’s Chuck Todd. 5:15: Nolte: . @ericbolling ”People are angry at me cuz I’ve called this Trump thing right from the beginning.” I know that feeling.  —   John Nolte (@NolteNC) February 24, 2016,  5:10: NBC News:  Jeb! apologizes to donors. To be fair, his advisers, especially Mike Murphy, and team of GOP establishment mercenaries who care more about their standing in the political world than any candidate”advise:” should also apologize for wasting all of that money: Jeb Bush told donors Wednesday afternoon that he had seen a path to victory “from the very beginning” of his campaign but was unexpectedly stymied by “outsiders making a compelling case to people who are deeply disaffected and angry. ” “I’m sorry that it didn’t turn out the way that I intended. When I launched the campaign in front of 000 people in Miami, I anticipated a different result,” an audibly disappointed Bush told donors on a national finance team call scheduled to thank them for their support. 5:02: Clinton says Hillary will stand her ground on Supreme Court nominees. He also accuses Republicans of making things up re: political speech equaling free speech (Clintons adopting some things from Sanders’s playbook). 4:57: Bill says Hillary is for immigration reform and we “need to keep the DREAMERs here” so “we can act like decent people. ” 4:50: Bill Clinton says he went to buy a pair of jeans and a woman approached him to talk about her children in   loans. Conveniently, Clinton uses the story to tout Hillary’s proposals re: college loans to appeal to millennials. 4:39: Shortly after the undisciplined Clinton takes a shot at Obama —  and his economy —  to make himself feel good even though his wife has been diligently trying to tie herself to Obama and his legacy to court critical black voters, Bill Clinton then touts Northern Virginia’s booming economy. In an obvious reference to Trump, Bill Clinton says “America never stopped being great” and “we need to make America whole again. ” He says Hillary doesn’t want to build walls and instead build bridges and tear down barriers. 4:33: Bill Clinton: Many Americans Can’t See Themselves in Picture of the Future that Obama Painted, Bill Clinton is stumping for his wife in Virginia. He can’t help himself. He takes another   shot at Obama, saying so many people can’t see themselves in the picture of the future that Obama painted because they haven’t seen wage increases and the economy hasn’t improved. He says Hillary is running for president to put everybody in the picture. RPV Chairman John Whitbeck’s statement on Clinton’s visit: “Nothing Bill Clinton can say or do can remedy the fact that voters have serious concerns about Hillary Clinton, to put it mildly. A recent Christopher Newport University poll found that 59 percent of Virginia voters had an unfavorable opinion of her. Whether it’s her inexcusable lapses in protecting classified information, her open embrace of Obamacare, her hostility to the coal industry, or her disastrous record on foreign policy, there are plenty of reasons Democrats are Feeling the Bern across the Commonwealth. The fact that her campaign had to send her top surrogate into the state less than a week before Election Day speaks volumes about where she stands. ” 4:32: “Four family members of Colorado   victims announced Tuesday they are endorsing Hillary Clinton for president” on the day Clinton sent a fundraising email suggesting Sanders stands against the Sandy Hook victims: This week, families from Sandy Hook are in court suing the manufacturer of the gun that killed their children, challenging the law that gives   legal immunity. I voted against that law. Senator Sanders voted for it. 4:22: Mitt Romney pulling a Harry Reid on Trump: Romney hits Rubio, Cruz, Trump on Fox over not releasing taxes. On Trump: ”We have good reason to believe there’s a bombshell  …    ”  —   Ryan Struyk (@ryanstruyk) February 24, 2016,  4:10: Poll: Trump Leading in Oklahoma: With less than a week before election day, Donald Trump is widening his lead in Oklahoma’s Republican primary race, according to a poll released Wednesday. The real estate mogul is holding an   lead over Florida Sen. Marco Rubio, with 29 percent to Rubio’s 21 percent, according to the poll. That lead has widened from just 5 percent two weeks ago. 3:59: The Great John Hayward: No One ‘Made’ Donald Trump, The problem with all these “Who made Trump?” accusations from the circular   is that Trump’s primary victory margins are far too hefty to be explained by factional maneuvers. He’s not winning by a tiny margin that could be portrayed as misguided dupes, and a healthy party doesn’t see its own voters as “dupes” anyway. Trump is winning because a lot of people are voting for him, including voters from demographics the other candidates were supposed to dominate, such as evangelicals in South Carolina and (if entry polls are to be believed) Hispanics in Nevada. Trump’s margins are also far too large to be dismissed as whatever unpleasant fringe movement a particular commentator prefers to blame, from the “alt right” to mischievous   trying to set up an easy   win for Hillary. A lot of the   commentary along these lines would be far more plausible if he was only winning by a point or two, but that just isn’t the case. [  …    ] Donald Trump throws a lot of sharp elbows at his competitors, but he doesn’t attack his own prospective voters, the way the Republican establishment and too many anguished conservative opinion leaders do. He says he’s going to fight for them  —  not in some abstract procedural or aspirational sense, but in a blunt and practical way. He’ll carve them a piece of the pie, bully the crybullies, and slap some sense into the bureaucratic empire sprawled along the Potomac. His voters give him a pass on the details because they appreciate his intentions  …     which is the ground Democrats usually prefer to fight on. It’s not the national conversation I wanted to have in 2016, but I’d rather try to understand the Republican electorate than insult them into submission, or threaten to stay home and saddle them with President Hillary because they dared to support Donald Trump. Read it multiple times here. 3:56: Headline says it all: Marco Rubio Gets Party’s Blessing, but Not Voters’ (The GOP establishment consultants who only hear what is said in their echo are   for Rubio and pettily insist they will not vote for Trump. The problem is there are many more voters than professional Beltway consultants who lose general elections and don’t know how to defeat Trump because they have never understood —  and never will —  the voters drawn to Trump’s  ) Senator Marco Rubio has persuaded wealthy donors, Republican Party elders and his colleagues in Congress that he represents their best chance to overtake the seemingly invincible force that is Donald J. Trump. He just can’t seem to convince the voters. 3:33: Popular vote numbers: Combined,   popular vote: Trump 420, 251 (32. 7%)Cruz 265, 756 (20. 7%)Rubio 257, 103 (20. 1%)Kasich 107, 314 (8. 3%)Carson 80, 853 (6. 3%)  —   Taniel (@Taniel) February 24, 2016,  Popular vote in IA+NH+SC+NV: McCain ’08: 257, 656 (30. 7% of total) Romney ’12: 312, 005 (31. 0% of total) Trump ’16: 420, 251 (32. 7% of total)  —   Taniel (@Taniel) February 24, 2016,  3:3o: YouGov Poll: Trump 34, Pope Francis 32: As you may know, Pope Francis recently criticized Donald Trump’s plan to build a wall along the U.

Margin of error = 4. 1%. 3:20: Tony Lee: This shows how incompetent the mainstream media, pundits, and GOP establishment operatives are. The type of disaffected voter that Trump has attracted hates both political parties because they believe Republican and Democrats are playing for the same team. They think Trump is someone who is from outside of the political system and beholden to nobody. He is essentially the jackass who will fight for Americans that the media looks down up and the both political parties ignore in favor of whatever the   interests that Trump is not beholden to want. These voters, once activated and   on a candidate, are not going to decided not to vote because of a “savagely negative campaign. ” A “savagely negative” campaign turns off the No    voters who, like the mainstream media, want politicians to hold hands and sing Kumbaya. The No    are the people with whom the majority of mainstream media members interact with in their social circles.

Unlike virtually all of his competitors, who repeat the same stump speech in the hopes of getting a   message across, Mr. Trump always surprises. And when he does get on camera, Mr. Trump often filibusters, as when a planned introduction of Sarah Palin, who endorsed him on national television last month, stretched into a lengthy monologue. (Ms. Palin, no slouch in the   department, then proceeded to “trump” Mr. Trump, with a   riff on “squirmishes” and “proud clingers. ”) Just how effective is it? Mr. Trump won the Nevada caucuses on Tuesday. Now, according to a tally published this week by NBC News, three of his Republican rivals  —   Mr. Kasich, Marco Rubio and Ted Cruz  —   are spending a combined $1. 5 million on television ads in the 11 states holding primaries or caucuses on March 1, known as Super Tuesday. Mr. Trump’s bill? Zero. 2:57: Thought experiment: Rubio allies and mainstream media writers who don’t want to concede that Trump won the Hispanic vote in Nevada are endlessly talking about the supposedly small sample of Latino voters. But if Rubio had received 51% of the Hispanic vote, would these same people be pointing to the “small sample size” —  or would they be pushing the narrative that Trump can’t even win minorities in his own party? Bottom line: Trump won nearly half of the Latino vote on Tuesday. 2:57: Sanders in Missouri (not in the South or South Carolina): ”I know in Kansas you’ve got a governor who likes to beat up on the poor!” @BernieSanders shouts to cheers in MO. pic. twitter.   —   Danny Freeman (@DannyEFreeman) February 24, 2016,  2:53: Clinton also brings up voting rights and says this will be one of the most consequential elections in our lifetime.

So yeah.  —   Chad Pergram (@ChadPergram) February 24, 2016,  2:20 pm  —   The Daily Beast is using the “I” word: The story of Donald Trump’s doomed campaign has been replaced by the story of his inevitability as the Republican nominee.   …     On Super Tuesday alone, the only states that Trump currently risks losing, according to Real Clear Politics averages, are Arkansas and Texas. And both of those states have Cruz leading by surmountable percentages (note, though, that polling in both states is not always frequent or entirely current). Even if Trump comes in second in Texas, he could still win. Texas is a state that is typically proportional in its delegate allocation but has what the website Frontloading HQ calls a “trigger,” which creates a condition in which the state becomes   . This would happen if a candidate wins a majority of the vote. Should this overwhelming victory not happen for Cruz, and, say, Trump comes in second in a proportional setting, the senator from Texas must cede a portion of the 155 delegates in play, thereby essentially handing the contest and the nomination to Trump. If Cruz can’t win his home state, he has little chance throughout the rest of the spring. 2:10 pm  —    : Reid lays it out https:  .  pic. twitter.   —   Ben Pershing (@benpershing) February 24, 2016,  2:06 pm  —   Cruz arrives for his rally.

People feel isolated, helpless, victim of powerful forces that they do not understand and cannot influence. It’s interesting to compare the situation in the ‘30s, which I’m old enough to remember. Objectively, poverty and suffering were far greater. But even among poor working people and the unemployed, there was a sense of hope that is lacking now, in large part because of the growth of a militant labor movement and also the existence of political organizations outside the mainstream. 1:31 pm  —   Trump: Fox should fire Karl Rove.

Dirty tricks, after all, are the modus operandi in our nation’s Capitol. It is a dirty trick to say you are “reducing spending,” when all you are doing is simply not spending as much as you could have spent or wanted to spend. It was a dirty trick when the Democrats decided to use a procedural technique to “deem” Obamacare to have been passed, even though the Senate and the House never voted on the same bill. And it was a dirty trick for Republicans to campaign on repealing Obamacare, but then simply sit back in Congress while the law went into effect. Americans know what dirty tricks look like, and, quite frankly, we’re sick of them. That’s why Ted Cruz, the   candidate, won in Iowa, it’s why Tea Party Patriots Citizens Fund endorsed him, and it’s why the Establishment will do anything to stop him. 12:17 pm  —   New York Times: Rubio Gets Party’s Blessing, but Not Voters’.

As Donald Trump has become the   —  a position confirmed last night, when he won the Nevada caucuses by a wide margin —  why has neither Marco Rubio nor Ted Cruz gone after him? Stevens, a   Mississippian, was especially vexed by what transpired in South Carolina. Trump picked a fight with the Pope and insisted that George W. Bush deliberately lied to the country about weapons of mass destruction in Iraq. The message was “part Michael Moore and part Christopher Hitchens,” Stevens said. But no decorated war heroes were sent to hound Trump. In a   state, no one raised the remark that Trump once made to Esquire: “You know, it doesn’t matter what [the media] write so long as you have a young and beautiful piece of ass. ” When Trump turned on the Pope, no religious leaders were brought in to point out that this was an attack on the notion, essential to politics in South Carolina, that faith ought to be present in the public square. “They could have crushed him on that,” Stevens said. “They didn’t try. ” When conservatives have attacked Trump, in   ads and interviews on Fox News, their line has been that he is a liberal in disguise. But Trump’s support doesn’t depend on him being an orthodox conservative. “The way to beat Donald Trump is to go after the essence of Donald Trump,” Stevens said. “Donald Trump is a ridiculous figure. He’s not a particular business success. Four bankruptcies! He doesn’t have a     understanding of policy —  he doesn’t know what the nuclear triad is. You’ve got to turn to Donald Trump in a debate and say, ‘You’re a ridiculous figure. You don’t know what you’re talking about. And this tariff idea will cost jobs, it will damage the economy, just like you bankrupted Atlantic City.’ ” Stevens recalled that after Vladimir Putin said some nice things about Trump, the candidate arranged his entire foreign policy around a   stance. Trump is “like a stray dog,” Stevens said. “Pat him on the head and he’ll follow you home. ” 11:40 am  —   HOT TAKE from one of the country’s leading providers of violence against minority babies: In #Trump’s America, anyone who doesn’t look or think like Donald Trump would experience more discrimination and more violence.  —   Cecile Richards (@CecileRichards) February 24, 2016,  11:39 am  —   Trump’s first congressional endorsement comes from Rep. Duncan Hunter: In an interview on Wednesday, Hunter told POLITICO that Trump has the strength needed for the job. “We don’t need a policy wonk as president. We need a leader as president,” Hunter said, adding that he has told his colleagues much of the same thing. “I’m in, and I’ve been in,” he said in a telephone interview. 11:33 am  —   The Huffington Post has some thoughts about last night.  11:30 am  —   Trump victories by location.

Women in their twenties, thirties, and forties would rally to her the way black Americans rallied to Obama she would run on her own mantle of change. In reality, nobody is that excited about Hillary Clinton, and young voters, women and men  —   the foot soldiers of any Democratic Party movement  —   aren’t coming around. She lost a resounding 82% of voters under 30 in Nevada. Her campaign now rests on the hope that voters of color like her well enough, if nowhere near as much as they like Obama. And that means that when she faces a Republican, she will have to destroy him  —   something the people who will be doing the destroying acknowledged when I asked them earlier this month. “The slogan is ‘Be Afraid. Be Very Afraid,’” said Paul Begala, who is an adviser to the   super PAC Priorities USA. 10:22 am  —   Magnitude of Trump’s Nevada win becoming clear.  —   Trump received more votes than the total GOP turnout in 2012!

His second choice is Rubio. “Anyone but Trump,” he told Breitbart News. “If Trump gets the nomination, I’m voting for Hillary. ”  Trump supporters,  “This is the only time I show my chest” 9:55: TRUMP CRASHES GLENN BECK’S CAUCUS SPEECH: Donald Trump crashed the caucus location where conservative talk show host Glenn Beck was speaking on behalf of Ted Cruz. MSNBC was broadcasting a live look at the caucus site, Palo Verde High School in Summerlin, when Trump suddenly showed up and made an impromptu speech of his own. “We are going to have hopefully a historic night,” Trump said. “I appreciate everybody being here. I wanted to be here myself and say a few words. ” The billionaire informed his Twitter followers he would be “at various caucus sites” throughout Nevada Tuesday, but didn’t specify where. 9:54: Cuomo, talking about the   friendship, asks Clinton who is her Scalia.

She says relationships underlie everything. She answers people like John   Collins. 9:48: South Carolina’s poet laureate asks how she will harness the power of forgiveness. Clinton says she could not be standing here if she had not been forgiven many times and if she had not been able to forgive those who had disappointed or wronged her. She talks about the Truth and Reconciliation Process in South America and speaks about the time she spent with Nelson Mandela. She said it was a stunning example of “what is possible” and we could do a lot more if we could “harness those feelings. ” She says she sees so much “anger” and talks about “violent images” and “threats against people” that are “deeply troubling” to her. Clinton says more people should walk in other people’s shoes and being more forgiving is one of our biggest challenges. 9:45: Charter school founder asks Clinton if our students are put at a disadvantage because international students go to school for 40 more days a year than American students. Clinton says we need to focus on disadvantaged,   kids and those with learning difficulties because they need more time to learn. 9:42: Questioner asks Clinton about funding Social Security. She says she will prevent Republicans from privatizing it and that has to be the highest priority. Regarding the trust fund, Clinton says “we have to go where the money is” and “have to look at different ways to get more money into the trust fund. ” She suggests raising the cap or expanding the Social Security tax to   income. She says she will do everything she can to extend the life of the trust fund.

Clinton says we also need to be concerned about widows who lose half their benefits when their husband dies. 9:30: Cuomo says   comedians love Hillary. Cuomo shows Clinton her interview with Scott Pelley in which she said she “always tries” to tell the truth. He shows her Colbert mocking Clinton’s answer and says if that’s a question that she would like another chance answering. Clinton says “no. ” My goodness, Cuomo tiptoes around the “drip, drip, drip” re: her email scandal [more proof the mainstream media treat Democrats like their own family while treating Republicans like the enemy]  …     Clinton says she has turned over 55, 000 pages of emails and claims that nobody has ever been as   as she has and says she is “not at all worried about it. ” That’s it, folks. We’ve asked what we had to ask and let’s go to the audience. No grilling at all. 9:30: A questioner asks what she would do to help strengthen families. Clinton says a lot of families are trying to keep “body and soul together” and are under tremendous economic stress. She speaks about raising the minimum wage and equal pay.

She says she is grateful for the experience and was grateful to the women who had been in the Senate before when she got to the Senate.

Clinton says most police officers perform honorably but “we have problems in our criminal justice system in a  lot of places that we can’t ignore. ” She says put aside any particular   or performance and cites instances like Walter Scott in South Carolina. She says the answer is not to find ourselves in opposing camps where we look at each other with “mistrust. ” She says police should be trained to use force as a last resort. She doesn’t answer whether she understands where the police officers who were opposed to Beyonce’s performance are coming from. 9:17: Clinton says Jim Crow is “unfortunately alive and well. ” She says there are places in South Carolina where black babies have a higher rate of dying than in a lot of other places.

Clinton tells the questioner that she has the right to wear her hair any way she wants to and that’s her right.

She cites the reaction to Beyonce’s Formation video (remember: CNN chose these questions to be asked)  …    . Clinton says we have to deal with “systemic racism” that is found in the criminal justice system, education,  housing. She says “systemic racism” is also cultural and asks the five women who have lost children to “senseless gun violence” and police action to stand up. Trayvon Martin’s mother and four others campaigned with Clinton earlier in the day and they are with her at CNN’s town hall in the audience. She says it is important for white people to realize that their experience may not equip them to understand what   citizens go through every day. 9:12: Joel in Nevada: Republican voters discuss the options at #Nevadacaucus at Durango High School, Las Vegas pic. twitter.   —   Joel Pollak (@joelpollak) February 24, 2016,  9:10: Cruz fires back at Trump. . @realDonaldTrump, showing class  grace, calls me a ”soft weak little baby.”  Hope he doesn’t try to eat me!  https:  .   —   Ted Cruz (@tedcruz) February 24, 2016,  9:08: Questioner asks Clinton how she would contain the sectarian violence that would ensue if Assad is toppled.

Clinton says that every election and caucus needs to be taken seriously and she is taking “no vote, no place for granted. Cuomo asks Clinton about her Wall Street transcripts because “they have become an issue. ” In a legalese answer, Clinton says she will if everybody else —  including Republicans —  releases their transcripts. She pivots and claims she has the best plans to combat the excesses on Wall Street. Clinton complains why there is one standard for her  …    . [perhaps because nobody got paid as much as she did giving speeches to Wall Street]  …     Clinton says everybody should be on a level playing field.

And most people around the world share that belief. 8:46: Questioner, who lost his father to lung cancer, asks Sanders about cigarette smoking and wonders what reforms Sanders would put in place if elected president like raising the minimum age for purchasing tobacco products.

Sanders says his message wasn’t resonating with anyone at he beginning of the campaign. He says   are becoming more receptive to his message of investing in jobs and education and “not jails and incarceration. ” Sanders says he has specific ideas on how the federal government can play a “major role” in ending the militarization of local police departments and ensuring that they look more like their communities. 8:14: Questioner asks Sanders how private historically black colleges and universities will be impacted by his plan for free public college for all.

Laxalt introduced Cruz to a crowd of about 400 at an outdoor park in rural Minden during the second of four campaign stops hours before Republicans start to cast their votes. Cruz said Republicans are asking the same questions about him that they asked of Reagan back then: Can he win? Is he too conservative?

Marco Rubio is fighting to prove he can build on his recent momentum. And Donald Trump, with his rivals locked in a battle for second, is fighting for a third straight victory to expand a delegate lead that could soon become insurmountable. Tuesday night’s Nevada caucuses force a critical test on the Republican Party’s leading presidential candidates. “I think it’s the most unpredictable of all the races we’ve had so far. You go in really knowing less about this than any other election,” said a    Rubio. “We’ll see. ” Cruz, a fiery conservative popular among voters on the GOP’s right, needs a spark to recover from one of the weakest moments of his campaign. After denying charges of dishonest tactics for several weeks, the Texas senator on Monday asked for and received the resignation of a senior aide who spread an inaccurate news report suggesting Rubio had criticized the Bible. That was just days after Cruz finished a disappointing third in South Carolina after spending much of the past two weeks defending his integrity. Another disappointing finish in Nevada’s   caucuses would raise new questions about Cruz’s viability heading into a crucial batch of Super Tuesday states on March 1. 5:39: Alex Swoyer on Trump’s afternoon rally: Ahead of Tuesday night’s caucuses in Nevada, GOP frontrunner Donald Trump told his supporters, “Keep your eyes out for dishonest stuff. ” “Dishonesty can knock out a poll very quickly,” Trump told his supporters at his campaign rally Tuesday afternoon in Sparks, Nevada, adding that dishonesty is the “only way we lose. ” 5:32: Marco Rubio Plans Summit with His Mentor Jeb Bush —  by Charlie Spiering: Rubio is planning to meet with his former political mentor Jeb Bush to try to bury the hatchet, the Florida Senator says.

From my   perspective  —   and that of Bartlett, who happens to be white  —   it is preposterous to see whites as marginalized and powerless in America after centuries of advantages. Yet it is neither wise nor fair to dismiss Trump’s voters as racists. Many see themselves as victims of a system that deliberately has overlooked their concerns about immigration, trade, education costs and other issues that have buffeted their lives. 4:43: Sanders campaign will reportedly clarify an email it sent to supporters claiming that Clinton’s campaign was charging donors $27, 000 to attend a Hollywood fundraiser: Bernie Sanders’ campaign will clarify an incorrect fundraising email they sent Tuesday morning that claimed Hillary Clinton’s campaign was charging “some donors” $27, 000 to attend a fundraiser in Los Angeles on Monday night. “It’s no exaggeration to say this is the most important stretch of our campaign,” reads the email. “Secretary Clinton’s supporters are responding: her campaign is holding at least a dozen   fundraisers this week, including one last night where some donors paid $27, 000 to attend. ” After sending the email Tuesday, Mike Casca, Sanders’ rapid response spokesman, acknowledged the email needed clarification. “Our supporters are really fired up about Clinton’s   fundraising, so when we send another fundraising email about it tonight we’ll be sure to clarify that the   donors ‘bundled’ instead of ‘donated’ $27, 000, which is more than the annual salary of a worker making $12 per hour,” Casca said. 4:39: The mothers of Eric Garner, Trayvon Martin, and Sandra Bland will join Clinton at a South Carolina town hall event. Clinton and Sanders will also meet at a CNN town hall event at 8 PM EST. 4:29: Trump tells his supporters that they have to go caucus for him tonight. “We have a mission. ” He says “and to put it in our language, you have to go vote, essentially. ” He again ask supporters to be on the lookout for “dishonest stuff. ” 4:26: “You are reprimanded,” Trump tells someone in the audience who shouted an obscenity. “I didn’t hear that. ” 4:25: Trump says his supporters are also the “toughest” in addition to being the “smartest. ” 4:22: Trump says he is beating Clinton in the polls and “I haven’t even started on her yet. ” Trump says “look at what we did to various people. ” He says he and his people took out candidates who attacked him like Walker, Perry, Jeb!. Trump says Jeb! didn’t take his call when he called him to wish him the best. He says maybe Jeb! called back and “we didn’t get the call. ” 4:21: Trump blasts Hillary for making a statement about “sexists. ” “She had a rough week with her husband,” Trump says, adding that the “last person” Hillary wants to run against is him. 4:20: Trump says “Hillary needs energy” and again points out that she lacks the stamina to be president. 4:17: According to CNN, the Clinton campaign reportedly has a DDD strategy to diminish Sanders as a   candidate, define him as someone with     proposals, and defeat him. 4:15: Trump rails against lobbyists who target people like Cruz and Rubio. He says it was a “disgrace” that GOP debates have been stacked lobbyists backing establishment candidates. Trump says he only had his family in the audience because he is   his campaign. 4:14: Big turnout expected in Nevada: Dems   31k https:  .   —   Nate Cohn (@Nate_Cohn) February 23, 2016,  BREAKING: Huge news for NV caucus.

Trump says “political correctness” is killing this country. 4:03: Trump says supporters are the “smartest” because they get the dishonesty going on in  . He blasts pundits for saying that his supporters are   ”uneducated” rubes. Trump says he won among   voters and people who are “smarter than anybody but they don’t have the big education. ” “We have the smartest people,” Trump says. “Remember that, folks. ” 4:02: Trump says “even the really dishonest press” have admitted that Trump’s supporters are the most loyal. He jokes that 68% of his supporters would not leave under any circumstances. He jokes: “I think that means murder, I think it means anything  …    ” “My people are the most loyal,” Trump says. “I love you. ” 4:00: Trump says he loves “knocking off bad people” and it was an “honor” to beat Cruz in South Carolina. Trump also cites his support across a broad swath of the GOP electorate. 3:57: Trump says Cruz has never employed anybody. He says he would really like to win in Texas. “I love Texas,” he says. Trump says Cruz is going to go “way, way down” in Texas because he has been exposed as a liar. 3:56: Trump says we are going to be “keeping Guantanamo” and will be “loading it up with bad dudes. ” 3:55: Trump says everybody “is taking advantage of us” because we have “incompetent” leaders. 3:54: Trump blasts former Mexican president Felipe Calderon for saying Mexico will not pay for the border wall. Trump says “they will pay for the wall. ” He says the wall will be impenetrable. 3:53: Trump says having Sarah Palin’s backing has been “so great. ” “She’s been so great. ” He also says he will be the greatest   president that God has ever created. 3:52: Trump says Christianity is under assault. He says evangelical leaders have said that Trump may not be perfect, but evangelicals want a leader like Trump. He praises the Falwells for building Liberty University. 3:51: Trump says he has spent less and he is number one. He says wouldn’t it be a  good thing to have a president who spends less and becomes number one. He brings up education spending and says wouldn’t it be nice if America spent its education dollars more effectively. 3:50: Trump says he is not sending back   donations that come with   letters because “there is no way” you can send it back nicely. 3:47: Trump says he cares about one thing —  “making America great again. ” Trump says he doesn’t get enough credit for   his campaign. “When you go to the voter booth, I hope you remember that,” he says. 3:45: Trump says America has “rebuilt China” and China has “drained us. ” He calls it the greatest theft in history. He says his Chinese friends, not thinking that he would run for president, have told him that they can’t believe the stuff they get away with. Trump calls America’s leaders the “stupid people. ” 3:43: Unlike Obama Trump says he will only have State dinners for countries that treat America well. 3:41: Trump says Border Patrol agents are now his friends and they don’t like being told to “stand back. ” He says we have people pouring through the border and “they’re not supposed to be here. ” He says “we are going to build a wall. ” 3:38: Trump says Hillary neither has the “strength” nor “stamina” to be president. Trump says remember that he called Bush a “ ” candidate and says, “I’m very good at this stuff. ” [Tony Lee: Trump has shown he can attack the Clintons —  and expose all of their vulnerabilities (like the war on women narrative) —  like nobody has done before because of his celebrity and the megaphone that he has. The Clintons don’t talk about the “war on women” solely because of Trump. It’s something that the   GOP establishment “geniuses” have not been able to do.] 3:37: Trump says nobody has committed the crimes Hillary has committed but she is “being protected. ” 3:36: Trump blasts failed GOP establishment strategist Stuart Stevens for giving “advice” on how Republicans can beat Trump when Stevens’s candidate Mitt Romney could not beat Obama. Trump says his hands shake and he sweats every time Trump is mentioned on air during Stevens’s appearances. 3:35: Demographer Dante Chinni, writing for NBC: Nevada’s Diversity Could Favor Trump: Nevada is one of the most racially and ethnically diverse states in the country and in Tuesday’s Republican caucuses, that could favor Donald Trump. That idea may sound counter intuitive. After all, in polls Trump fares especially poorly with minority voters. In the latest NBC   Wall Street Journal poll, only 13 percent of African Americans and 15 percent of Hispanics say they have positive feelings about the candidate. Among whites that figure is 31percent. But results from the South Carolina Republican Primary suggest he does pretty well in counties with large minority populations. There are 28 counties in South Carolina where the white,   population is below the state average of 62. 9 percent. Trump beat his state percentage in 25 of them. The other 18 counties, where the white,   population is above the average, he didn’t do as well. 3:33: Trump slams Nikki Haley for “backing the wrong horse. ” He says he has been nice to Rubio because Rubio hasn’t hit him yet. But “when he does, you’ll see what happens. ” 3:32: He calls the mainstream media the “stupid people. ” 3:30: Trump blasts the “disgusting press. ” He says they “tell you what to do” and think and they are probably more disgusting than Cruz. 3:28: Trump slams Cruz for not disclosing his Goldman Sachs loans. 3:27: “We’re shaking things up,” Trump says after citing good poll numbers from Ohio and Florida. 3:25: Donald Trump takes the stage in Sparks, Nevada. In his final rally before tonight’s Nevada caucuses, Trump says “it’s down to crunch time. We’ve got to do it. ” Trump says “watch out for dishonest stuff. ” “If you see anything, let us know about it,” Trump says. “We have a lot of people watching. ” Trump says New Hampshire was 100% legit and beautiful and South Carolina was “absolutely perfect. ” Trump says “we have tremendous poll numbers here” but “you never know” because “dishonesty” can knock out poll numbers. Trump says the only way we lose is because of “dishonesty. ” Trump says other candidates made their speeches and ran away. He tells the crowd that you shouldn’t vote for people who abandon you. Trump says “I’m going to be with you all night. ” Trump asks people to stick around for a bit to watch if there are any shenanigans. 3:21: Angry Reid says GOP is becoming the party of Trump: Cruz surrogate Steve Deace threatens to castrate himself if Ted Cruz apologizes again: https:  .  pic. twitter.   —   Media Matters (@mmfa) February 23, 2016,  3:16: Cruz surrogate Steve Deace really doesn’t want Cruz to apologize anymore  …     maybe he’s trying to top Glenn Beck’s claim that God killed Justice Scalia to help Cruz win the white House: Cruz surrogate Steve Deace threatens to castrate himself if Ted Cruz apologizes again: https:  .  pic. twitter.   —   Media Matters (@mmfa) February 23, 2016,  3:07: On CNN, Dr. Ben Carson says he hops the race does not become a “personality contest” as the field winnows. Addressing his comments about how Obama was “raised white,” Carson says “go back and read the whole interview. ” He says the “real key” is that many people in America are very “uncomfortable when it comes to issues of race. ” He says he crossed the “PC barrier” and says nobody will deny that someone who was raised in Hawaii with his white grandparents and then raised in Indonesia by his white wife does not have the “typical black experience. ” When Poppy Harlow questions Carson about his “raised white” comments, Carson says “it doesn’t mean anything bad” and it just means that Obama’s cultural experiences are “vastly different” from that of most black Americans. He says that isn’t a bad thing, it’s just different. Carson says he grew up in Detroit and Boston. He says he lived in the “ghetto” in Boston where there was dire poverty. In contrast, he says Obama went to private schools and grew up in affluent environments. (To be fair, Obama has said on numerous occasions when addressing criminal justice reform that he may have fallen through the cracks had he grown up in a different environment.) Carson says he believes that “all the emphasis on race is way overblown” and “this conversation is contributing to it. ” Carson says this flap is a “nothingburger. ” Flashback: In 2006, liberal columnist Stanley Crouch wrote:  Other than color, Obama did not  —   does not  —   share a heritage with the majority of black Americans, who are descendants of plantation slaves. Of course, the idea that one would be a better or a worse representative of black Americans depending upon his or her culture or ethnic group is clearly absurd. [  …    ] Obama is being greeted with the same kind of public affection that Colin Powell had when he seemed ready to knock Bill Clinton out of the Oval Office. For many reasons, most of them personal, Powell did not become the first black American to be a serious presidential contender. I doubt Obama will share Powell’s fate, but if he throws his hat in the ring, he will have to run as the son of a white woman and an African immigrant. If we then end up with him as our first black President, he will have come into the White House through a side door  —   which might, at this point, be the only one that’s open, 2:57: Kasich fires back at critics: Kasich was asked about pressure to clear way for Rubio, others. ”I would hope they’d be clearing the decks for me.” pic. twitter.   —   Kailani Koenig (@kailanikm) February 23, 2016,  2:50: Rubio is Wall Street’s new darling: Marco Rubio’s radical alignment with the financial industry https:  .  from @rortybomb,  —   Catherine Rampell (@crampell) February 23, 2016,  2:42: After a federal judge questioned Hillary Clinton’s motives for setting up a private   account and declared that her top aides should testify, it is perhaps fitting that Clinton visited the set of Scandal last evening. 2:35: Spike Lee’s wife reminds Democrats that she’s for Hillary after her husband cut a radio ad for “brother” Bernie: Just to be clear, while my husband @SpikeLee supports Bernie Sanders @HillaryClinton is my candidate!

But not his campaign manager’s. As Mr. Cruz has elbowed into the top tier of candidates, his campaign has conspicuously reflected the brand of its principal architect: Jeff Roe, an operative with a reputation for scorching earth, stretching truths and winning elections. 1:27 pm  —   Photo by Joel Pollak.

The ACU said in a statement provided exclusively to Breitbart News: Although, Marco Rubio has built a conservative record and has a high ACU rating, he and his campaign have made a rookie mistake. Today the Rubio campaign informed ACU’s chairman that their candidate is unwilling to make time to meet with activists and answer their questions at CPAC 2016. 12:46 pm  —   Huffington Post says Glenn Beck has told Ted Cruz crowds he owns George Washington’s copy of Don Quixote —  but that is likely false. 12:34 pm  —   Ohio newspaper gives Kasich’s rationale for staying in the race to become the favored establishment candidate. The Marco Rubio campaign touted big donors and endorsers including former presidential nominee Bob Dole and former Minnesota Gov. Tim Pawlenty. The John Kasich team touted fewer new endorsements and billionaire backers, but countered with polling that showed the Ohio governor locked with Rubio in some upcoming primary states. At stake: the title of the Republican establishment’s choice, tasked with taking on frontrunner Donald Trump. The Rubio campaign argues their man has already earned the mantle with his    second place in the South Carolina primary Saturday, which prompted Jeb Bush to abandon his presidential bid. Team Rubio’s sentiment: Kasich has no chance and should drop out, and soon. The Kasich campaign argues no one has won the title yet. Only three states have voted, after all, and Kasich and Rubio are separated by only five delegates. Kasich will beat Rubio in more moderate states and will win Ohio March 15, Team Kasich says. Still, the campaign is already staving off growing pressure to call it quits. 12:27 pm  —   “This piece is the first in an ongoing series of essays by women about Hillary Clinton. ” I haven’t seen BuzzFeed publish a brazen advocacy piece for a candidate until this forceful   article. https:  .   —   Dominic Holden (@dominicholden) February 23, 2016,  12:21 pm  —   Kasich with more bantz: John Kasich is performing far better in his home rate of Ohio than Rubio in his home of Florida. https:  .   —   Team Kasich (@TeamJohnKasich) February 23, 2016,  12:19 pm  —   Rubio at the press rope line, via Joel Pollak: 12:18 pm  —   Trump mocks: Unlike the other Republican candidates, I will be in Nevada all day and night  —   I won’t be fleeing, in and out.

While there’s bellyaching about mean Tweets, this is an interesting tidbit: FIX: Does Trump treat the press corps any differently off camera than he does on camera?  Or does he still not interact with you at all  —   or very little? Johnson: We have very little interaction with him on a daily basis, but we occasionally get close. The Donald Trump you see in a small setting  —   a visit to a campaign office, a quick interview backstage, a lunch stop  —   is a different person than the bellowing,   candidate you see on the rally stage. In    settings, he’s charming, softer spoken and rather relatable. While his nasty, mean comments get the most attention, he’s also capable of being overwhelmingly kind, almost to the point of being uncomfortably kind. I’ve interviewed a number of people who have spent a little bit of time with Trump  —     endorsers, dedicated volunteers, police officers assigned to protect him  —   and all remark on how he somehow made them feel like the most important person in the world. 11:56 am  —   Start of the line for Trump’s rally.

By making this very careful statement, Trump keeps the looming possibility of Hillary Clinton being indicted alive. Even if the Obama administration gives her a pass, as we all expect, Trump can drive the DC Media insane by keeping the indictment threat alive through the end of the general election. Hillary’s media will be desperate to put this entire issue to bed after the Obama administration grants her absolution. Trump is not going to allow that to happen, The idea of the Clintons finally facing justice for their sins will also keep the base excited. Once again, Trump is violating all of the DC Media’s rules that are set up to elect Democrats. Like Bill and Hillary’s sordid past with all of these women, Trump goes there and goes there and goes there.  —   10:24 am  —   REMINDER: Nevada GOP caucus is tonight.
