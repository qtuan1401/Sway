Wednesday on CNN, while reacting to Republican presidential nominee Donald Trump’s comments on Russia, David Gregory said he had “run out of words” to express his “shock. ”  Gregory said, “You know, I’ve run out of words to express my shock at how completely beyond the pale that Donald Trump is as a potential leader of the free world and our    of our country. This was truly beyond the pale. He is encouraging Russia, which by all accounts was behind the leak of one of our major political parties, to do more, to go beyond, to try to hack into Hillary Clinton’s server to find missing emails to kind of get in the middle of the scandal. ” “It’s as if, you know, this is a child playing with matches who doesn’t understand how badly he and the country can get burned,” he added. “It’s a very serious thing. And I think that the one thing about Trump is that he is very clear for all to see, he is making very clear what he thinks, how he comes by information, and I think, frankly, the lack of seriousness and the intemperance with which he speaks about important national security matters should certainly give people pause. I don’t think there’s anybody that would think that was anything but a fair reading of what we’ve seen here. Vladimir Putin is dangerous. ” Follow Pam Key on Twitter @pamkeyNEN
