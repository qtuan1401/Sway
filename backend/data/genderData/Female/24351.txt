During the Saturday broadcast of “AM Joy” on MSNBC, American Urban Radio Networks White House correspondent April Ryan accused GOP presidential nominee Donald Trump and other Republicans who despise Democratic presidential nominee Hillary Clinton of pressuring FBI Director James Comey to reopen the criminal investigation against Clinton.  “Let’s look at the facts. James Comey has been pressured by Donald Trump and by all the other Republicans who intrinsically feel a pure hatred for anything to do with the Clintons or Hillary Clinton. So, that has been out in the public square and debated. And James Comey came back with this to give them something to get off of him,” Ryan said. Follow Trent Baker on Twitter @MagnifiTrent
