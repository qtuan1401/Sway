’  ’ ’   Senate Minority Leader Harry Reid on Thursday skewered his   Republican colleagues, contending that GOP lawmakers had treated   President Barack Obama with ”unprecedented disrespect” and   suggesting such actions created the conditions ripe for the   candidacy of Donald Trump, the Republican presidential nominee. ’ ’   ”As this Republican Congress heads for yet another unearned   recess, I feel compelled to comment on how Republicans have   treated the president of the United States during the last eight   years,” Reid said on the Senate floor. ’ ’   The Nevada Democrat continued: ”History will look back and note   that Republicans in Congress treated President Obama with   unprecedented disrespect. No one expected them to agree with   everything that he did or tried to do, but Americans deserve   better than the way Republicans behaved toward President Obama.” ’ ’   Reid said it was ”clear” Republicans were treating Obama with   ”contempt” by blocking much of his agenda and, most recently, his   Supreme Court nominee. ’ ’   ”Republicans have not done their basic work of government,” he   said. ’ ’’ ’   The outgoing Democrat linked the actions of GOP lawmakers to   Trump, arguing that the party had in fact created him. ’ ’   ”Everything that he’’s said, stood for, done in this bizarre   campaign that he’’s run has come  —   filtered up from what’’s going   on in the Republican Senate,” Reid said. ”Disagreeing with   everything, anything that President Obama wanted. They   filibustered things they agreed with just to slow things down.” ’ ’   Reid continued: ”Trump is no anomaly. He is the monster the   Republicans built. He is their Frankenstein monster. They own   him. All you have to do to see that the Republicans are the party   of Trump is to look at the way they’’ve treated him.” ’
