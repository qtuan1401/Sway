Tuesday on CNN’s “The Lead,” former presidential candidate Sen. Marco Rubio ( ) said he will vote for the presumptive Republican presidential nominee Donald Trump because he explained he signed a pledge.  Rubio said, “Like I said yesterday, I think Donald  —   he’s the presumptive nominee, but he would be best served by having active surrogates who agree with him on these issues. My reservations about his campaign and my policy differences with him are well documented and they remain and I think he would be best served by having people close to him and his campaign that are enthusiastic about the things he stands for. ” He added, “I signed a pledge that said I would support the Republican nominee and intend to continue to do that. But here is the situation that we’re in. On the one hand I don’t want Hillary Clinton to be the  —   I don’t want her to win this president of the United States election, on the other hand, as I said, I have well defined differences with the presumptive nominee of the Republican party. I intend to live up to the pledge that we made. But that said, these concerns that I have about policy, they remain and they’re there. But that doesn’t mean that Donald needs to change his positions in order to get my support. As I said earlier, I think he should be true to what he believes and continue to campaign on those things and make his case to the American people. ” Follow Pam Key on Twitter @pamkeyNEN
