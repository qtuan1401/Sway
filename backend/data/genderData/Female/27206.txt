Conservative icon Sarah Palin quipped that paid   protesters show presidential candidate Donald Trump is creating jobs even before taking office as she called them out for false accusations at the Western Conservative Summit in Denver, Colorado on Friday. [“Like a golden wrecking ball [Trump] shattered walls in the good ol’ boys club. He knocked out the hypocritical intolerance that dare stymie freedom of speech with intimidation and those false accusations of sexism and racism just to stop debate,” said 2008 vice presidential nominee Palin. Alaska’s former governor pointed to the “silly protesters” at Trump rallies as those behind the accusations. She remarked at seeing “a bunch of them this morning coming out of the hotel. ”  “We’ve been telling him he should hold his rallies at construction sites. You know protesters aren’t going to show up at a job site,” said Palin. “Did you know some of those rebel rousers, they’re actually paid protesters. So there you go, not even president yet and our guy’s already creating jobs. ” Fox News Insider reported on a Craigslist ad soliciting for   protesters, allegedly posted by supporters of Bernie Sanders. The Washington Times has reported on MoveOn. org fundraising efforts capitalizing off of a Trump rally in Chicago that was cancelled due to massive numbers of protesters and the threat of impending violence.
