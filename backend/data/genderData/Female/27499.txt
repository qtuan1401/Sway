Former Obama adviser David Axelrod said Hillary Clinton has a problem with “stealth” not her health on CNN’s “The Lead” on Monday.  Axelrod said, “It’s not health, it’s stealth that is the problem that she has to deal with, and by allowing that six hour gap, they created this sense that they were trying to put one over on people, and that is not helpful to her candidacy. ” He added, “Donald Trump is the most outspoken and least transparent presidential candidate in my lifetime. And, whereas medical records may be something that she needs to respond to because of this incident in 2012, these tax returns are very important in terms of understanding Donald Trump, because he’s a guy who has a huge amount of debt. ” Follow Breitbart. tv on Twitter @BreitbartVideo
