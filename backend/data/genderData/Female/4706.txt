(Want to get this briefing by email? Here’s the  .) Good evening. Here’s the latest. 1. Republicans are divided over the looming question of who will be nominated as the next secretary of state.   Donald Trump’s advisers are split in their support of Mitt Romney and Rudolph Giuliani. We probably won’t hear an announcement until next week at the earliest. Mr. Trump is also expected to announce Wilbur Ross, above, as his pick for commerce secretary. He’s a billionaire known as the “king of bankruptcy” for buying, restructuring and selling fading companies. K. T. MacFarland, a White House veteran and frequent Fox News commentator, was Mr. Trump’s choice for deputy national security adviser. ____ 2. Homeowners next to one of Mr. Trump’s Scottish golf courses are protesting by flying Mexican flags. He’s been feuding with residents who refuse to cede their land to him. Mr. Trump even built a wall to block the sea view of one couple and then sent them the bill. It went unpaid. ____ 3. The   and Republicans in Congress are vowing to repeal much or all of the Affordable Care Act. But open enrollment for 2017 is underway, and Americans are steadily signing up or renewing their coverage. More people in Florida than in any other state got insurance through the new exchanges. Many refuse to believe that a benefit they count on would be taken away. ____ 4. Rising sea levels are changing the way people think about waterfront real estate. Buyers are asking about preparations for storm surges and flooding, and some are growing wary of investing in areas most vulnerable to the effects of climate change. Some analysts say the impact of a collapse in the market could surpass that of the bursting   and real estate bubbles. ____ 5. President Recep Tayyip Erdogan of Turkey is threatening to reopen the floodgates of migrants into Europe. He has accused European officials of breaking their promise to accelerate talks on Turkey’s bid to join the E. U. And the U. N. is working with Australia on an unusual agreement to move refugees housed in offshore detention centers and resettle them in the U. S. ____ 6. Protests are continuing against an oil pipeline near the Standing Rock Sioux Reservation in North Dakota. A    woman is recovering from severe injuries to her left arm after an explosion there on Monday. She may lose the limb. The police and protesters are blaming each other for the predawn explosion. ____ 7. The police in London are facing scrutiny after the killings of four young gay men. The man convicted of killing them was sentenced to life in prison. He found them on gay dating sites, then drugged, raped and killed them. He’s also accused of raping many others. The police admitted they might have missed opportunities to catch him. They are looking into 58 other unexplained deaths in London involving date rape drugs. Above, the family of Jack Taylor, one of the victims. ____ 8. Israel has arrested 22 people over the wildfires that erupted on Tuesday throughout the country and that are still burning. While unusually dry conditions and strong winds helped fan the flames, almost half of the fires are suspected of being arson. After Israeli officials hinted that they suspected Palestinians were behind the arsons, Arab leaders urged caution against blaming their community without proof. ____ 9. Among our   articles is our obituary of Florence Henderson, who played the upbeat mom on “The Brady Bunch. ” She died at 82. Ms. Henderson began her career in stage musicals, but her role as Carol Brady made her an enduring TV presence for decades. In a 1999 interview, she was asked how she wanted to be remembered. “Probably as someone who survived for a long time in a very tough business and, hopefully, managed to retain a sense of humanity,” she said. ___ 10. We’ve compiled our list of the 100 most notable books of 2016. We’ll defer to our books editor, Pamela Paul, to describe the selection process. “In many ways, the entire year at the Book Review is a   to this moment,” she wrote in an email. “Each week, after we review a book, we decide whether it deserves to be an Editors’ Choice. At the end of the year, we pull together these 500 or so works and narrow them down to 100 books, 50 fiction and 50 nonfiction. The real winners are readers. ” ___ 11. Finally, there’s a lot to see on the silver screen this weekend. Our critic liked “Allied,” above, a World War   romantic thriller directed by Robert Zemeckis and starring Brad Pitt and Marion Cotillard. The film is “like an expertly tailored suit or a properly cooked classic dish. It’s not so much a work of art as a triumph of craft, and therefore a reminder of the deep pleasures of   technique and long experience,” he wrote. If you don’t make it to the theater, “Gilmore Girls: A Year in the Life” is streaming on Netflix, and we have a few other recommendations for smaller screens. Have a great weekend. ___ Photographs may appear out of order for some readers. Viewing this version of the briefing should help. Your Evening Briefing is posted at 6 p. m. Eastern.
