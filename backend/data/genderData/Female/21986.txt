A landlord in Grand Junction, CO, stated in his listing he will not rent to Republican candidate Donald Trump’s supporters.[  “I guess I did it because I want America to wake up, and I know that I can’t change people’s vote but any vote for Donald Trump is in the way wrong direction,” explained landlord Mark Holmes. He told 9NEWS he “considers himself a political activist. ” While the Fair Housing Act does not allow landlords to discriminate, it does not mention “political affiliation. ” Holmes, who lives above the apartment for rent, said, “I didn’t want to live with somebody that is going to vote for Donald Trump, they’re just not my kind of person. ”
