’  ’ ’   White House press secretary Sean Spicer got into a heated   exchange with reporters at Tuesday’’s press briefing over   President Donald Trump’’s Monday tweet calling his executive order   that temporarily bars people from seven   nations   from entering the US a ”ban.” ’ ’   Early in the briefing, Spicer said referring to the order as a   travel ban was incorrect and a falsehood about the statute that   was being perpetuated by the news media. ’ ’   NBC News White House correspondent Kristen Welker told Spicer   that a Monday tweet from Trump referred to the order as a ban. ’ ’ ’ ’ ’t’t’tIf the ban were announced with a one week notice, the ”bad” would rush into our country during that week. A lot of bad ”dudes” out there! ’t’t’ ’   ”So he says it’’s a ban,” Welker said. ’ ’     ”He’’s using the words that the media is using,” Spicer     responded. A reporter in the room fired back, ”It’’s his words!”   ’ ’     Spicer said the order ”can’’t be a ban” if people are still     being allowed into the country.   ’ ’     ”It is extreme vetting,” he said.   ’ ’     Welker kept at it.   ’ ’     ”The president himself called it a ban,” she said.   ’ ’     ”I understand,” Spicer replied.   ’ ’     Welker asked, ”Is he confused, or are you confused?”   ’ ’     Spicer insisted he was not.   ’ ’     ”No, I’’m not confused,” he said. ”I think that the words being     used to describe it are derived from what the media is calling     this. . .. [Trump] has been very clear that it is extreme     vetting.”   ’ ’     He fired back, claiming that Welker and NBC News ”have been     part of the confusion,” and criticized the news network for     referencing a  report that Secretary of     Homeland Security John Kelly had not been properly consulted     before the executive order was signed on Friday.   ’ ’     ”It was accurate,” Times reporter Glenn Thrush shouted out.   ’ ’     ”How can it be accurate reporting, Glenn?” Spicer asked. He     pointed to  during     which he pushed back on the report.   ’ ’     ”You’’re calling him a liar?” Spicer asked.   ’ ’     ”I’’m not calling him a liar,” Thrush responded.   ’ ”     The  bars for 90 days people     from Sudan, Syria, Iraq, Iran, Somalia, Yemen, and Libya  —       countries identified by former President Barack Obama’s     administration as terror hotspots  —   from entering the US. It     also bars all refugees for 120 days, and bars Syrian refugees     indefinitely.   ” ’     The order was interpreted to include barring those who are     legal permanent residents in the US, known as       holders. It led to widespread confusion at major airports over     the weekend and legal permanent residents being detained. On     Sunday, Kelly ordered   holders from the countries to     be allowed into the US.   ’ ’ issued a     temporary stay on Saturday preventing authorities from     deporting travelers who were stuck in airports because of the     order, but the   legality of the measure remains     unclear.   ’ ’         ’ ’         ’ ’     ’
