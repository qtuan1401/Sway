Sunday on CNN’s “State of the Union,” Hillary Clinton campaign manager Robby Mook said he was not “aware” if the Clinton campaign had contact with any of the women accusing Donald Trump of sexual misconduct.  Partial transcript as follows: JAKE TAPPER: Donald Trump says that your campaign or the Democratic National Committee are behind the accusations against him of sexual misconduct. I know Secretary Clinton yesterday said the charges are inaccurate, but let me put it more narrowly. Have any of these women had any contact with your campaign or the DNC? ROBBY MOOK: These accusations are not coming from our campaign. TAPPER: But have they had any contact? MOOK: Not that I’m aware of. I don’t know about any contact. Jake, what’s important to look at here is Donald Trump claimed yesterday he was going to go out and roll out his final plan for the campaign, his final message, his plan for the first 100 days. He spent time attacking his accusers. His top priority right now is to attack these people who are bringing up concerns, we’re seeing it across the board. he should just apologize and move on. This is telling about what kind of president Donald Trump would be. Follow Pam Key on Twitter @pamkeyNEN
