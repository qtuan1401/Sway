Violent assault entirely another.  —   Christopher Hayes (@chrislhayes) June 3, 2016,  John Podesta, a top surrogate of former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton, was also quick to condemn the Democrat mob violence and put distance between his candidate and the most ardent supporters of Clinton and Vermont Senator Bernie Sanders.
