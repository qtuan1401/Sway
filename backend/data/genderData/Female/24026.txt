(AP) Don’t look for Gennifer Flowers in the audience at Monday’s kickoff presidential debate between Donald Trump and Hillary Clinton.  That’s according to a transcript by “Fox News Sunday,” in which Trump’s vice presidential running mate Mike Pence says “Gennifer Flowers will not be attending the debate tomorrow night. ” Pence spoke after Trump tweeted Saturday that he might ask Flowers to sit in the audience. Flowers claimed that she and Clinton’s husband, Bill, had a   affair. The allegation nearly derailed Clinton’s 1992 presidential campaign. He acknowledged having caused pain in his marriage and went on to win two terms as president. Earlier Sunday, Trump campaign manager Kellyanne Conway said on ABC’s “This Week” that Flowers has a right to attend the debate if “somebody else gives her a ticket. ”
