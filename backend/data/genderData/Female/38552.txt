Washington (CNN) Indiana Democrats took responsibility Monday for a     flub that left local officials looking into allegations of voter disenfranchisement. Officials from Marion County, Indiana, said they were investigating reports of text messages directing voters to the wrong polling location, just the latest voting problem to hit the home state of Donald Trump running mate Mike Pence.  ”We are aware of the text messages that have been reported to the clerk’s office,” said Michael Leffler, spokesman for Marion County prosecutor Terry Curry.

Mike Pence has been blasting in a flurry of stops.
