(Want to get this briefing by email? Here’s the  .) Good evening. Here’s the latest. 1. A second night of protests over a police shooting turned violent in Charlotte, N. C. Gunfire at a demonstration left one man critically injured on life support and prompted law enforcement authorities to fire tear gas on the crowd. The episode that set off the protests was the killing of a black man, Keith Scott. He was the third African American fatally shot by police officers in a week. _____ 2. Secretary of State John Kerry tried to save a “shattered”   in Syria, two days after a lethal airstrike destroyed much of an aid convoy destined for Aleppo. He expressed frustration with Russia, which the U. S. holds accountable for the strike, and bluntly lashed out at the Syrian government. “How can people go sit at a table with a regime that bombs hospitals and drops chlorine gas again and again and again and again and again and again?” he said at a meeting of the U. N. Security Council. _____ 3.  A notebook  kept by the suspect in the weekend bombings in Manhattan and New Jersey includes a list of international terrorist leaders, suggesting that he was inspired by both Al Qaeda and the Islamic State. Above, an image from a Homeland Security video. And investigators are hunting for two men who happened upon a second bomb left in Chelsea on Saturday  —   and who walked off with the bag it was in, leaving the wrapped bomb behind. Some law enforcement officials said their jostling might have disabled the bomb, averting greater carnage. _____ 4. Only now is it becoming clear how seriously European terrorism investigations were damaged by a deliberately set fire at Belgium’s main forensic storehouse last month. The fire  —   set by three people who simply cut through a perimeter fence in the middle of the night  —   destroyed thousands of pieces of evidence critical to the prosecution of some suspects in the Paris and Brussels attacks, along with hundreds of other criminal and terrorism cases. _____ 5. In the presidential race, Hillary Clinton outlined both a plan to fight poverty (create   jobs and affordable housing) and her vision of an “inclusive economy” that expands job options for Americans with disabilities. The unspoken undercurrent of that second plan: one of Donald Trump most unpopular moments, when he mocked a Times reporter who has a physical disability. _____ 6. Mr. Trump had a couple of stumbles in his attempts to raise his historically low support from   voters. He urged a nationwide    effort, saying the practice had worked well in New York. In fact, it was deeply controversial in New York and has been halted. And Mr. Trump’s appearance at a meeting of black pastors in Ohio suffered when Don King, the boxing promoter, shifted from “Negro” to a racial epithet in his introduction. _____ 7. “What once seemed impossible now appears inevitable. ” That was the U. N. secretary general, Ban   announcing that the Paris climate agreement would almost certainly go into legal force this year after a remarkably rapid collection of commitments from signatory nations. Here is our full coverage of the United Nations General Assembly. _____ 8. Mark Zuckerberg and his wife, Dr. Priscilla Chan, set a high bar for philanthropy last year when they pledged to give 99 percent of their Facebook shares to charity. Their first major science initiative is, to say the least, ambitious. They are dedicating $3 billion to prevent, cure or manage all diseases by the end of the century. _____ 9. What do Basques, African pygmies, Sherpas and Cree Indians share? Apparently  —   along with the rest of us  —   origins in a single population that emerged from Africa between 50, 000 and 80, 000 years ago. Three teams of researchers who analyzed genomes from around the world have solved one of the most important mysteries of human history. “We know there were multiple dispersals out of Africa, but we can trace our ancestry back to a single one,” a genome expert said. _____ 10. There were also revelations from sometime around the first century A. D. Experts using a new computer imaging program were able to virtually unwrap a burned, fragile ancient scroll, revealing the earliest known example of the authoritative text of the Hebrew Bible. “We have never found something as striking as this,” an expert on the Dead Sea scrolls said. Above, a composite of the scroll. _____ 11. Whether Deflategate rises in importance to the level of history may be debated by New England Patriots fans. But rigorous science applies there, too. Researchers whose work led to Tom Brady’s   suspension are finally talking about their careful tests and retests. “We knew this was going to get a lot of scrutiny, from your   science classes to your physics professors,” one said. In the end, they failed to turn up any plausible reason outside of tampering for why the Patriots’ game balls were underinflated in a crucial game in January 2015. _____ 12. Finally, what are Finnish postal workers encouraged to do for patrons besides delivering mail: mow the lawn, tutor basic math and reading, share other patrons’ magazine or play charades? The question is not out of the blue  —   it’s from our international desk’s quiz in honor of its 100th What in the World feature. (The answer is “mow the lawn,” so you’re already one up!) _____ Your Evening Briefing is posted at 6 p. m. Eastern. And don’t miss Your Morning Briefing, posted weekdays at 6 a. m.
