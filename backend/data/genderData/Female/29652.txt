Tuesday on the campaign trail, Republican presidential candidate Gov. John Kasich ( ) reacted to the news that Corey Lewandowski, the campaign manager for his opponent Republican presidential   Donald Trump, was charged with misdemeanor battery in an incident involving former Breitbart News reporter Michelle Fields at a Jupiter, FL, campaign event on March 6.  Kasich said given the circumstances, he would either fire or suspend Lewandowski if he was his employee. “If I was in this circumstance, I would take some sort of action, either suspension or firing,” he said. “I just have to think about any time where I’ve seen anything that I’ve made an exception to that. There is an exception to every rule, but that’s the action that I would have taken. ” Follow Pam Key on Twitter @pamkeyNEN
