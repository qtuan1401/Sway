Piers Morgan sharply criticized Meryl Streep’s   Trump Lifetime Achievement Award acceptance speech at the Golden Globes Sunday night, calling it “hypocritical” and “the worst performance of her career. ”[Morgan writes in the Daily Mail:  Last night, Streep received a Lifetime Achievement award at the Golden Globes, and chose the moment to launch a very personal attack on Donald Trump. She began by saying that Hollywood, foreigners and the press are ‘the most vilified segments of American society right now’. At which point the cameras panned out to hundreds of the richest, most privileged people in American society sitting in the audience in their $10, 000 tuxedos and $20, 000 dresses, loudly cheering this acknowledgement of their dreadful victimhood. She then said that if all the ‘outsiders and foreigners’ were kicked out of Hollywood, ‘you’ll have nothing to watch but football and mixed martial arts, which are not the arts.’ Wow. I haven’t heard such elitist snobbery since Hillary Clinton branded Trump supporters ‘a basket of deplorables’.   …     But putting all that to one side for a moment  —   and if Trump WAS mocking a man’s disability then I agree it was disgraceful  —   let’s move to what Streep said next: ‘Disrespect invites disrespect. Violence incites violence. When the powerful use their position to bully others, we all lose.’ At this point, I laughed out loud with incredulity. Not at the words themselves, which are laudable. No, it was at the hypocrisy. You’d be   to find an industry that encourages more disrespect and violence than Hollywood.   …     Read Morgan’s full column at the Daily Mail.
