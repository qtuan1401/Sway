The senior lawyer for the Oklahoma Republican Party organized 35 of his colleagues to join him in signing a letter to Sen. Charles Grassley (R. ) the chairman of the Senate Judiciary Committee, supporting President Donald Trump’s nomination of Judge Neil Gorsuch for the Supreme Court. [Anthony J. Ferate, the Oklahoma GOP’s general counsel, said it is important that a Supreme Court justice knows where the role of a judge ends and the role of Congress begins.  As an attorney that learned Separation of Powers directly from Justice Scalia, Gorsuch is a perfect choice. #ConfirmGorsuch,  —   Anthony J. Ferate (@AJFerate) February 1, 2017,  “Judges risk becoming unelected legislators when they do not utilize the restraint essential to service in the Judiciary,” Ferate said. “There should be no such reservation about Judge Gorsuch, and the attorneys signing the letter feel strongly about saying that,” he said. “Judge Gorsuch embodies an exceptionally qualified scholar of the law that has exhibited respect for our Constitution, including the Separation of Powers and the 10th Amendment,” the letter read. The 10th Amendment especially is important for Americans concerned about preserving the country’s federal systems, with a national government   with 50 sovereign states. The amendment was the last amendment approved for the first amendments known as the Bill of Rights, and it was meant as the final backstop to prevent the national government from growing beyond the intent of the Framers. It reads: “The powers not delegated to the United States by the Constitution, nor prohibited by it to the States, are reserved to the States respectively, or to the people. ” In the letter, the party attorneys wrote that Gorsuch has a history of understanding the different roles of Congress and the courts. “All too often judges do not recognize the restraint required of a judge we have no such reservation here. ” Another point the GOP attorneys made was that Gorsuch could be trusted to protect free speech rights against schemes to restrict speech through campaign finance laws and regulations. “Specific to the work we each conduct on behalf of state Republican parties, we believe that in cases such as Riddle v. Hickenlooper, 742 F. 3d 922 (2014) Judge Gorsuch made clear his respect for Supreme Court precedent and how he values free speech rights for all in our country, particularly with a focus on elections,” the attorneys wrote. The Riddle v. Hickenlooper case centered on a Colorado law that restricted political contributions to $200 in a primary and $200 in a general election. Gorsuch joined the majority at the 10th Circuit of the Court of Appeals, which overturned the law. Trump nominated Gorsuch to the Supreme Court Feb. 1 to fill the vacancy created by the Feb. 13, 2016 death of Justice Antonin Scalia. The judge is a graduate of Columbia University, Harvard Law School, and he earned a PhD from England’s Oxford University. He is the son of Anne Gorsuch, who led the Environmental Protection Agency for President Ronald Reagan.
