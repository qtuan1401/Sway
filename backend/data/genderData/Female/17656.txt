The following was originally posted on radio host Mark Levin’s Facebook page in response to this article by Breitbart News’ John Nolte:  Ah, now I get it. A stupid attack on Cruz’s citizenship helps Cruz because now the Democrats won’t use it should Cruz become the GOP nominee. And, we are told, this is not a settled legal issue so we need a federal court to resolve it as quickly as possible  —   or resolve it some other way. And, if you reject all this as a stupid political attack that distracts conservatives from real issues, you obviously are on the wrong side of a cultural divide. Now, I expect this kind of incoherence from liberals, but not from young, aspiring conservative writers. First, it is a settled constitutional and statutory matter. It was settled when Trump said it was settled in September and it was settled when Trump   and said it was an issue a few days ago. Cruz’s mother is an American citizen, was an American citizen when she gave birth to Cruz, and is, in fact, Cruz’s mother. Seems fairly simple. Not only that, American citizens give birth to American citizens, whether here or abroad. That’s not only common sense, it is the law. And think about it for a moment  —   if you follow their stupid argument, babies born of American citizens serving abroad in our military would be   citizens ineligible to run for president. That’s stupid. Moreover, we don’t need federal judges to tell us what we can discern on our own. We can read the constitution, statutes, history, etc. Just because the Supreme Court has not ruled does not mean the issue isn’t settled. And it is highly doubtful the court would involve itself anyway under the political question doctrine. However, Trump is free to bring a lawsuit and “settle” the issue. Crazy lib Alan Grayson has already declared he will do so, even though he has no standing. Read the rest of the article here.
