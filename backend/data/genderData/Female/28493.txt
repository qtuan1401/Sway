Priebus said, “It was a positive mood, a mood of cooperation and a feeling that it’s time to unify the party. I think both parties wanted to do that. It was great. It was really a positive step towards unification. ” He continued, “I’m not going to get into the specifics. I hate to spoil the fun. It was a private meeting, private conversation. Certainly everything you’re hearing about is accurate, that it was all positive and it was cooperative, it was great. ” He said, “This thing was supposed to be over a month from now or two months from now. Everyone was a little caught off guard how quick it all ended. We all were surprised. ” Priebus added, “People didn’t think this thing was going to be over two weeks ago.
