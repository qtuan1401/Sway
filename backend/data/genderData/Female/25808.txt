Friday on ABC’s “Good Morning America,” Kellyanne Conway, the campaign manager for Republican presidential nominee Donald Trump, told   David Muir that Trump’s line from a night earlier at a rally in Charlotte, NC about his regret for some of his past remarks was “all him” and added that should incentive for those criticizing him to “some recognition and some forgiveness. ”  “He was talking about anyone who feels offended by anything he said, and that’s all him,” she said. “You know, he took extra time yesterday going over that speech with a pen, so that was a decision he made. Those are his words. And I hope that everybody who has criticized him at some point, David, for being insensitive or for mocking someone at least shows some recognition and some forgiveness. ” Follow Jeff Poor on Twitter @jeff_poor
