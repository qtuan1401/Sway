Friday on Fox New Channel’s “America’s Newsroom,” Republican presidential nominee Donald Trump’s campaign chief Paul Manafort said the Republican Party is “united,” and “you will see a coming together of both Paul Ryan, Mitch McConnell and Donald Trump in the course of this campaign. ”  Manafort said, “First of all the Republican Party is united. Do we agree with everything? No. Mr. Trump is an outsider. He’s not of the political system. So his relationship with the leadership of the party are not as deep and long as traditional would be with the Republican nominee. But that’s not to say he doesn’t have good relations. We are working strongly with Reince Priebus and the RNC and with the Republican leadership in the House and Senate. I think you will see a coming together of both Paul Ryan, Mitch McConnell and Donald Trump in the course of this campaign because they all agree on one thing: We need a Republican president and a Republican  congress then we’ll make the changes that America needs. ” Follow Pam Key on Twitter @pamkeyNEN
