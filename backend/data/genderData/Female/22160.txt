Appearing on the Fox Business Network Wednesday, Meghan McCain, daughter of Senator John McCain, said that it was hard for her to watch former Alaska Governor Sarah Palin endorse Republican frontrunner Donald Trump. “It is hard for me to watch her endorse Donald Trump after what Donald Trump said about my father’s service,” she said.  McCain was referring to Trump’s feud with her father which resulted in Trump hitting back, “He’s not a war hero,” Trump said. “He was a war hero because he was captured. I like people that weren’t captured. ” Meghan McCain also accused Palin for “pandering” in her support of Trump. The Hill: “I was shocked simply because I know of her relationship with Ted Cruz. She’s debatably responsible for his political career,” McCain said. She also chided Palin for “pandering” and distancing herself from conservative values. “I wish I just saw this a little less like pandering. And doing something that’s popular instead of sticking with your integrity and the kind of conservative beliefs that she has espoused for so long. ” This is a bizarre criticism from the same Meghan McCain who has spent the last 7 years doing everything but praise Palin for her “integrity. ” In fact, were it not for her   of Palin to the delight of the mainstream media, Meghan McCain would probably not have a media career. During an appearance on MSNBC, McCain also smeared the late Andrew Breitbart as a reason she does not feel welcome in the Republican Party. This, despite the fact he invited her to join Breitbart News as a contributor. Tell us again about the integrity.   Follow John Nolte on Twitter @NolteNC
