Monday on “CBS This Morning,” Comedy Central “Daily Show,” host Trevor Noah said   Donald Trump’s victory was a result his voters’ putting sexism and racism “above everything else. ”  Noah said, “Well, the biggest thing I’ve seen is America is not as immune to the ills of the world as I thought it was. You know, I think a lot of the world is disappointed in America because America is that  —   is that beacon, that lighthouse, you know, a bastion of democracy. I think it’s sad we are living in a place we are normalizing and moving on so quickly from two glaring truths that were part of what happened in the election. I acknowledge a white working class that is something we can talk about, but we cannot deny that many of Donald Trump’s supporters were earning large amounts of money and doing great for themselves, but there are people who put two things above everything else —  and that is whiteness and that is also sex and misogyny. People talk about the glass ceiling but what you don’t realize you can’t see it because it’s   and misogyny has quickly gone out of the conversation. And even as a man I have tough grips to come —  there is a monster that keeps you down. ” Follow Pam Key on Twitter @pamkeyNEN
