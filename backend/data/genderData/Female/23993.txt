The congresswoman, who represents a district in Mexico that has over 2 million people living in poverty, said her proposed   would “deter violence or harassment [on] social networks” by preventing the spread of “harmful” or “humiliating” images. Mexican netizens responded by taking to Twitter, sharing dozens of Photoshopped images of the politician on the #Ladymemes hashtag, including several comparing her to Jabba the Hutt from the Star Wars franchise. #LleveSusMemesCalientitos Nunca fue la intención castigar memes: Dip.
