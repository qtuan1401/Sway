  Donald Trump’s spokesman Jason Miller isn’t ruling out former presidential candidate Mitt Romney as a potential secretary of state. [The announcement comes after former Arkansas Gov. Mike Huckabee heavily criticized Romney for his opposition to the   throughout the 2016 election.  “No decision has been made on that position,” Miller told reporters on Wednesday morning when asked if Romney is still being considered for secretary of state. “He’s looking at a number of very highly qualified potential choices there. ” Earlier on Wednesday morning Huckabee, a loyal supporter of Trump after he dropped out of the primary, suggested Romney would be an insult to Trump supporters because he’d criticized Trump during the election. “He attacked [Trump] on a personal level about his character, his integrity, his honor,” Huckabee stated on Fox News’s morning show, “Fox  Friends. ” “When you do that, there’s only one way that Mitt Romney can be considered for a post like that, and that is if he goes to a mic in a very public place and repudiates everything he said in that famous Salt Lake City speech and everything he said after that  —   Donald Trump wasn’t fit, that he lacked character. I mean, on and on,” Huckabee declared, referencing a speech Romney gave in March where he called Trump a “phony,” and a “fraud. ” Miller said Huckabee has been a “fantastic advocate” for Trump. “What’s really going to drive the   is the judgment and decision making strengths that he looks at with protenial applicants to any position,” Miller stated, adding that Trump is “looking for things like chemistry, experience” and someone who has a “similar vision” to him and the Vice   Mike Pence.
