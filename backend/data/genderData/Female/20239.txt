DES MOINES, Iowa  —   Donald Trump promised to start “removing criminal illegal immigrants” on day one during his speech in Des Moines, Iowa on Saturday at Sen. Joni Ernst’s second annual Roast and Ride when he spoke to roughly   supporters. [“On Day One, I am going to begin swiftly removing criminal illegal immigrants from this country  —   including removing the hundreds of thousands of criminal illegal immigrants that have been released into U. S. communities under the   Administration,” the Republican nominee stated.  Trump’s comments come after speculation that the New Yorker was waffling on his immigration stance  —   specifically on deportation. He has continuously promised to deport illegal criminals whom he calls the “bad ones. ” “These international gangs and cartels will be a thing of the past. Their reign of terror will be over,” Trump proclaimed. He continued: In this task, we will always err on the side of protecting the American people  —   we will use immigration law to prevent crimes, and will not wait until some innocent American has been harmed or killed before taking action. I am going to build a great border wall, institute nationwide   stop illegal immigrants from accessing welfare and entitlements, and develop an   tracking system to ensure those who overstay their visas are quickly removed. If we don’t enforce visa expiration dates, then we have an open border  —   it’s as simple as that. I am also going to cancel all unconstitutional executive orders and empower    ICE officers and Border Patrol officers to finally do the jobs they were hired for. Roughly 2, 000 GOP supporters came to see the Republican nominee in Des Moines, Iowa at the Iowa State Fairgrounds. . @realDonaldTrump takes the podium at #RoastAndRide in #iowa @BreitbartNews pic. twitter.   —   Alex Swoyer (@ASwoyer) August 27, 2016,
