Wednesday on Fox News Channel’s “The Real Story,” presumptive Republican presidential nominee Donald Trump said his   list includes 10 people with “very big names. ”  When asked about potential running mates Trump said, “I’m actually looking at ten people. Three or four called me up  —   very big names, senate and governors and all, and they want to be considered. We’re looking very, very strongly. I met with Joni. She is terrific and very supportive. As you know, Bob was with me yesterday and he told me everything he really would like to do . Bob is a terrific guy. We spent the day yesterday.  —   very supportive and I’m very supportive of them. I’ll be seeing Newt later on and Newt is Newt, great guy, tough and smart. ” He added, “A lot of people are calling me that you wouldn’t even think about. They want to get their name thrown into the hat. We are going to look at some people. ” Follow Pam Key on Twitter @pamkeyNEN
