(Want to get this briefing by email? Here’s the  .) Good evening. Here’s the latest. 1. The German authorities are searching for a    Tunisian man in the deadly truck attack on a Christmas market in Berlin. He is known to have used multiple aliases and is believed to be armed and dangerous. Local news agencies reported that he has ties to an Iraqi preacher arrested in Germany last month who is accused of recruiting soldiers for the Islamic State, which has claimed responsibility for the attack. Identification papers indicating that the Tunisian man had been denied asylum were found in the truck. A German official said prosecutors had been observing him on suspicion that he was plotting an attack. _____ 2. The jockeying has begun for ambassadorships under   Donald Trump. Donors, loyalists and people close to his children are trying to put themselves in the running. There are some early favorites, including Woody Johnson, the owner of the New York Jets, above with Vice   Mike Pence, for Britain. _____ 3. Speaking of appointees, Mr. Trump’s pick for secretary of state, the Exxon Mobil chief Rex Tillerson, above left, was once a vocal critic of Russia’s justice system. Then he came to realize that the key to success in Russia, a country deeply important to the company’s future, was developing personal relationships with President Vladimir Putin and the head of the state oil company. _____ 4. Two   YouTube stars said they were kicked off a Delta Air Lines flight at a London airport for speaking Arabic. Adam Saleh and Slim Albaher were on their way home to New York after performing their stage show, which mixes comedy and inspirational speaking. Social media erupted with anger against the airline industry, but also skepticism, since Mr. Saleh, above, has perpetrated video hoaxes in the past. He insisted that this was no prank. _____ 5. Extremely warm temperatures in the Arctic over the last two months could lead to record low levels of ice this summer, with cascading effects around the globe. Over all, 2016 broke the Arctic’s record for the warmest year. “We need people to know and understand that the Arctic is going to have an impact on their lives no matter where they live,” a scientist said. Above, a cruise ship off Alaska in August, on a journey made possible by diminished sea ice coverage. _____ 6. Executions, death sentences and public support for capital punishment in the U. S. have all fallen to their lowest levels in decades. State executions this year hit a   low, and juries imposed the fewest death sentences since 1972. Executions halted that year and death penalty laws had to be rewritten after the Supreme Court struck down existing laws, saying that capital punishment as administered in the U. S. constituted “cruel and unusual punishment. ” _____ 7. We went out on patrol with Arizona Border Recon, which calls itself a nongovernmental organization. Others call a militia. Many members are armed  —   retired law enforcement agents or veterans who operate with little oversight. They say they’re protecting the border and hunt for migrants to hand over to Border Patrol. “Because we live out here, we do this ” one said. _____ 8. Muhammad Ali, Gwen Ifill, David Bowie and Natalie Cole are just a few of the notable figures lost in 2016. We remember them in our annual feature, “The Lives They Lived,” with portraits and essays about their remarkable stories. _____ 9. Finally, fodder for your good intentions for 2016: a year’s worth of scientific findings on the nearly incalculable benefits of exercise. One hits your wallet: Walking 30 minutes a day could save you $2, 500 annually on medical costs. And if that’s not enough to get you moving, take heart: Even fidgeting is beneficial.
