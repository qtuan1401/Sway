Washington Post columnist E. J. Dionne commented Saturday on MSNBC on GOP   Donald Trump’s campaign, saying Southerners hear “racial overtones” to his immigration statements.  “I think in the case of Donald Trump, a lot of people in the South hear a kind of candidate that they have related to in the past, his attacks on political correctness, racial overtones to what he says about immigration on other issues and his general attack on the establishment.

He went on to say that the Republican party has taken working class voters for granted, and Trump is “running a kind of class war. ” Follow Trent Baker on Twitter @MagnifiTrent
