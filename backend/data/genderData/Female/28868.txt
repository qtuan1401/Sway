Traveling between campaign events Thursday, the oldest son of Republican presidential candidate Donald Trump made an unexpected stop in Mesa, Arizona to help a stalled motorist. [“This JUST happened in Mesa and THIS is why I’m voting for Trump,” Maricopa County Republican Party Chairman Tyler Bowyer posted on Facebook along with a video. “We were on our way from a rally to another event and Donald Trump Jr. hopped out first to help push this ladies car off the road, get some water and call for help. On the way back from the rally and filmed the whole thing! Needless to say, she was pretty surprised to find out it was Donald Trump Jr pushing her car. I will never forget this and it’s why I’m proud to be supporting this family! #MAGA“  In the video, Trump Jr. and two other good Samaritans are seen pushing a Chevy Impala out of the road. This is why I’m voting Trump! @DonaldJTrumpJr helping push a ladies car off the road in 101 degree heat in Arizona after a rally today #MAGA pic. twitter.   —   Tyler Bowyer (@conservatyler) October 27, 2016,  “I’ve been around a lot of politicians. Most would just freak out or go around. ” Bowyer told the Arizona Republic. “But Don Jr.   …     before you can blink, he’s out there pushing the car. ” “[The woman] was just stunned. She was taken aback,” Bowyer continued. “She was like, ‘Man, I have to be able to tell people about this.’ So we made him get out and take a picture. And that was it. ” Bowyer added that the group left the woman with every bottle of water they had so she wouldn’t get dehydrated in the afternoon heat, which reached 100 degrees in Phoenix Thursday, while waiting for help to arrive. Bowyer said the woman didn’t say who she planned to vote for on November 8.
