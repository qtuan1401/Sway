Sen. Cory Gardner ( ) is questioning how GOP frontrunner Donald Trump could defeat the Islamic State (ISIS) after he seemed unable to figure out the Colorado delegate process. [“How on earth are you going to defeat ISIS if you can’t figure out the @cologop convention?” the Colorado senator tweeted.  Gardner took to Twitter unleashing a series of tweets blasting Trump for claiming that the Colorado delegate selection was a fix after Sen. Ted Cruz ( ) swept nearly all the delegates at the state GOP convention: I’ve attended CO GOP conventions for years. It requires organization  attn to grassroots to win. Cruz had it. Trump didn’t. End of story.  —   Cory Gardner (@CoryGardner) April 12, 2016,  Darryl Glenn came out of nowhere to win @cologop convention for US Senate. That should be the story. Not @realDonaldTrump’s temper tantrum.  —   Cory Gardner (@CoryGardner) April 12, 2016,  . @tedcruz showed up to the @cologop convention. @realDonaldTrump only sent a surrogate. Cruz swept. Elections are won by those who show up.  —   Cory Gardner (@CoryGardner) April 12, 2016,  Spoke to dozens of Trump supporters this weekend, listened to his surrogate speak twice, not 1 person complained abt process until he lost.  —   Cory Gardner (@CoryGardner) April 12, 2016,  How on earth are you going to defeat ISIS if you can’t figure out the @cologop convention?   #copolitics,  —   Cory Gardner (@CoryGardner) April 12, 2016,  How can you protect Israel at the UN when you’re completely baffled by the @cologop convention process?   #copolitics,  —   Cory Gardner (@CoryGardner) April 12, 2016,  If you cannot navigate the @cologop convention what is your plan for Putin? #copolitics,  —   Cory Gardner (@CoryGardner) April 12, 2016,  If you can’t figure out the Colorado GOP delegate process how can you figure out how to balance the national budget?  —   Cory Gardner (@CoryGardner) April 12, 2016,  I’m proud of the @cologop and Chairman Steve House for a fair and well run convention.
