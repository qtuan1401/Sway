(Want to get this briefing by email? Here’s the  .) Good evening. Here’s the latest. 1. Turkey declared martial law as military factions attempted a coup. President Recep Tayyip Erdogan, whose whereabouts was previously unclear, flew back to Istanbul. It was a sign that the coup was failing as factions fought for control. “There is no power higher than the power of the people,” Mr. Erdogan said earlier, using an iPhone to broadcast messages. Our live coverage is here. _____ 2. World leaders expressed solidarity and outrage as France reeled from its third major terrorist attack in 19 months. “The times have changed,” Prime Minister Manuel Valls said, “and France is going to have to live with terrorism. ” The weapon was chillingly mundane: a   refrigerator truck, driven into a crowd of people watching holiday fireworks in the Mediterranean city of Nice. At least 84 people were killed  —   including children  —   and more than 200 injured in a   trail of carnage. _____ 3. The police shot and killed the   driver. He was identified as Mohamed Lahouaiej Bouhlel, a    Tunisian who moved to France about 10 years ago. _____ 4. In the U. S. the attack prompted Donald Trump to pledge to seek a declaration of war from Congress against Islamic terrorists. He also delayed an appearance with his newly named running mate, Gov. Mike Pence of Indiana, above. Newt Gingrich, whom Mr. Trump passed over for vice president, stirred controversy by saying that American Muslims who believed in Shariah law should be deported. _____ 5. Plans for the Republican National Convention, which starts Monday, were still taking shape. The football player Tim Tebow denied reports that he would be speaking, and the rabbi of Mr. Trump’s daughter Ivanka backed out of delivering the invocation. More than a dozen senators also say they have better things to do next week. (Jeff Flake of Arizona said he would be “mowing my lawn. ”) _____ 6. Congress released 28   pages of its 2002 inquiry into the Sept. 11 attacks, which list possible links between Saudi officials and Qaeda operatives. Lawmakers and families of victims fought for years to declassify the pages, which were kept secret to protect U. S.  relations. Repeated investigations failed to confirm any official Saudi role, and Saudi officials welcomed the release as a way to “clear up, once and for all, any lingering questions or suspicions. ” _____ 7. In theaters this weekend: “Ghostbusters. ”  Our reviewer calls it cheerfully silly  —   and a lot like the 1984 comedy hit, “except that it stars four funny women instead of, you know, four funny men. ” The   Paul Feig, she writes, is “one of the best things to happen to American   comedy. ” And here are more recommendations from our entertainment experts on TV and streaming options. _____ 8. Herbalife, the supplements company, avoided being classified as a pyramid scheme by the Federal Trade Commission but agreed to pay $200 million to resolve accusations of deception. Herbalife’s stock rose 11. 7 percent, to $66. 15. _____ 9. Researchers made inroads on understanding just how much harsher the misery of jet lag is going east than west. The team’s mathematical model of the body’s   cells shows that a westward trip across nine time zones can take eight days of recovery, because lengthening a day is easier to handle. The eastward parallel may take a person 13 days to bounce back from. _____ 10. Finally, China’s farmers think they can offer customers something even better than organic. They are adapting the herbal elixirs in traditional Chinese medicine for  their cows, pigs and ducks. One farmer said that what’s good for the goose is good for those dining on the goose. “In the old days, we used traditional methods to feed the animals,” one farmer said. “People’s longevity was very long. ” Have a good weekend. _____ Your Evening Briefing is posted at 6 p. m.
