Oh, and also, be under FBI investigation and   indictment? Can’’t. Can’’t.” ’ ’   The conservative personality called the latest FBI revelation   ”the greatest gift given to any candidate of all time in the   history of America” and added that if Clinton still managed to   win, it would be akin to proof ”magic exists.” ’ ’’ ’   Throughout the 2016 campaign cycle, Beck has been a fierce critic   of Trump, vowing to never vote for the New York businessman.
