Documentary filmmaker Michael Moore showed up at Trump Tower in New York City on Saturday seeking a    meeting with   Donald Trump. [“I’m going to join the people who’ve formed a protest of this racist, sociopath on his way to the White House,” Moore said in a Facebook live video that has received more than a million views.  Moore, a   activist who predicted Trump’s victory, attempted to enter Trump Tower at around 1:00 p. m. wearing a San Francisco 49ers cap. After Moore attempted to walk inside the building, security told him he would need to go to the back of the line and be searched before he could enter. “Maybe if he’ll let me in his office,” Moore said to a woman who asked if he was going to meet with Trump. “I came last Saturday and talked to Kellyanne Conway. It went well. They didn’t kick me out. ” Moore did manage to make his way to the fourth floor, but was turned away by Secret Service. On Friday, Moore said that the “millions” of Americans who voted for Obama changed their minds and voted for Trump. “They’re not racists,” Moore said Friday on MSNBC’s Morning Joe. Before leaving the building to rejoin the Trump protests, Moore left a note with a doorman. “Mr. Trump. I’m here. I want to talk to you,” Moore wrote in a note.
