Republican presidential candidate Sen. Ted Cruz’s campaign says it has $19 million cash on hand. [Cruz’s communications director Rick Tyler tweeted the announcement.  Cruz campaign will announce $19 million cash on hand in Q4 report.  —   Rick Tyler (@rickwtyler) January 29, 2016,  Jeff Roe, Cruz’s campaign manager, also mentioned the figure at a Bloomberg Politics breakfast briefing on Friday. According to Bloomberg: He argued that the campaign is built for the long haul and that Cruz is the only candidate who can defeat Donald Trump, whether or not Cruz wins Iowa in the     caucuses on Monday. “I think it’s gonna be a record turnout,” Roe said. Most analysts say a large turnout could favor Trump since it would suggest his unconventional campaign has drawn new voters out to support him. Any conservative vote cast for a candidate other than Cruz is a “wasted vote,” Roe said, predicting that Marco Rubio wouldn’t be a “close” third.
