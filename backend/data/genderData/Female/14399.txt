Newly   U. S. Education Secretary Betsy DeVos was greeted by a group of protesters blocking the front entrance to a Washington, D. C. school she was scheduled to visit Friday. [DeVos, a supporter of charter schools, was greeted by a small group of protesters, some of them holding “Black Lives Matter” signs, another holding a sign that read, “Feminists Are the Majority,” and at least one yelling, “Shame!” when she arrived at Jefferson Middle School Academy, reports NBC News. DeVos reportedly left the front door and entered the school through the rear door instead.  ABC News’ Sam Sweeney tweeted video of the protesters clashing with police: Handful of protesters now standing in front of SW DC middle school ahead of visit by Sec.
