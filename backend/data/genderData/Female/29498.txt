Republican nominee Donald Trump enjoyed a warmer welcome from the Veterans of Foreign Wars (VFW) in Charlotte, North Carolina than his rival Hillary Clinton received on Monday. [The New York Republican told the crowd that spending time with veterans has been the “greatest honor of this campaign. ”  “Our veterans are the bravest and the finest people on earth,” Trump said, as he pledged to work with the VFW if elected president. “Our most basic commitment to provide health and medical care [to veterans] has been violated completely. ” “The other candidate in this race, crooked Hillary Clinton, [  …    ] has a much different view,” Trump jabbed. “She recently said of the VA scandal that it isn’t as wide spread as it was reported to be. ” Some people in the audience chanted “lock her up” in reference to Clinton. Campaign signs are banned from the #VFWConvention but calls to ”lock her up” are occasionally being bellowed across the exhibit hall,  —   Sara Murray (@SaraMurray) July 26, 2016,  ”Lock her up” chants as Trump addresses #VFWConvention.
