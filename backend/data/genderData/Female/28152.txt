Legendary   Clint Eastwood chimed in on the feud between Khizr Khan, the father of slain U. S. Army Captain Humayun Khan, and GOP presidential candidate Donald Trump, accusing the Democratic Party of “taking advantage” of the Gold Star father. [“I think he made a mistake by making fun of the guy’s dead son, but that’s his business,” Eastwood told TMZ, referencing Trump’s remarks about the Khan family. “I don’t think you have to be too politically correct, but you don’t have to be rude to somebody. ”  Eastwood continued: “But also, the guy was being exploited by a political party. That’s no good either. ” Khan spoke at the Democratic Nation Convention last month and launched a   assault on Trump over his temporary ban on Muslim immigration and his past comments on Islamic terror. During his primetime speech at the DNC, Khan  —   who has several ties to the Democratic Party and to the Clinton Foundation  —   said that Trump “consistently smears the character of Muslims. ” “Whether either party does it, exploitation shouldn’t take advantage of some poor slob,” Eastwood said.  The      Academy   made headlines Wednesday after his thoughts on Donald Trump’s war on political correctness emerged in an interview with Esquire. “He’s onto something, because secretly everybody’s getting tired of political correctness, kissing up,” Eastwood said. “That’s the   generation we’re in right now. We’re really in a pussy generation. Everybody’s walking on eggshells. ” Asked if he’d support either Trump or Clinton for president, Eastwood suggested that he would probably vote for Trump because Clinton would continue to promote the policies of President Obama. “I’d have to go for Trump   …     you know, ’cause she’s declared that she’s gonna follow in Obama’s footsteps,” he said, adding that Clinton would be “a tough voice to listen to for four years. ”   Follow Jerome Hudson on Twitter: @jeromeehudson
