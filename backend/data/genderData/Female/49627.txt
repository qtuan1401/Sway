’  ’ ’       Donald Trump will  Gary Cohn,     the longtime chief operating officer at Goldman Sachs, the     director of the National Economic Council.   ’ ’     If you’re keeping count, that would be another Goldman alum in     Trump’s orbit, in addition to: former Goldman banker (and     former Breitbart honcho) Steve Bannon, set to be a key     White House adviser; former Goldman         Steven Mnuchin, who will head the     treasury; and former Goldman banker Anthony Scaramucci, now a     key transition adviser.   ’ ’     Is it a betrayal to hire men like Cohn, who the last time I saw     in person was   a bartender at Davos?   ’ ’     After all, Trump lambasted Hillary Clinton for giving highly     compensated speeches to the investment bank and trashed Sen.     Ted Cruz because his wife worked there, and a      scaremongering about current Goldman CEO Lloyd Blankfein looked     as if it might have first run in the  ’ ’     So, yes, you could read Cohn’s appointment as another sign of     hypocrisy, more proof that the Trump campaign was just a carny     act. But it’s also something else: a sign that some aspects of     the system are working exactly as they’re supposed to, and long     have.   ’ ’       Cohn, a   veteran of the firm, is very much a central       cog in the global financial establishment. And in accepting       the position, Cohn is simply following a   path.       Government service —  particularly the National Economic       Council —  is what top Goldman executives do when their careers       have run their course.     ’ ’       The National Economic Council was created during the first       year of the Clinton administration. Its inaugural director       was  the   of Goldman Sachs       who was an influential early Clinton adviser. After two years       at NEC, Rubin was promoted to Treasury Secretary. Rubin’s       partner in running Goldman in the 1990s was . Friedman       left the firm in 1994 but in 2002 was named to succeed Larry       Lindsey as —  yup —  director of President George W. Bush’s       National Economic Council.     ’ ’       Friedman and Rubin were succeeded at the helm of Goldman by       Jon Corzine, who went on to run successfully for U. S. Senate       and then governor after he was ousted in 1998. Corzine was       replaced by Henry Paulson, who had been the chief operating       officer. And when Paulson’s time at chief executive at       Goldman came to an end, he skipped the NEC and went directly       to the Treasury Department (thus forcing me into the public       humiliation of . ).     ’ ’  ’ ’         Unlike Paulson or the other Goldman execs who went on to         head the NEC, Cohn never made it to the top. Indeed, one of         the strange features of the past several years has been a         certain stasis at the head of America’s largest financial         institutions. Jamie Dimon has been running JPMorgan Chase         for 12 years, through crisis, cancer, and a mammoth list of         fines, yet shows no signs of giving up. Brian Moynihan is         completing his sixth year as CEO as Bank of America. And         Lloyd Blankfein, the CEO of Goldman Sachs, is now entering         his second decade in the role.       ’ ’         One could have imagined Blankfein taking a job in the         Clinton administration. (His beard,   and         liberal social views mark him as a Democrat.) But the         results of the November election foreclosed that option.         For an ambitious heir apparent at Goldman, which Cohn has         been for the past several years, the only way up is out.       ’ ’         Like many of those who thrive at Goldman, Cohn is affable         in public;   tough,   in         private; political but not particularly ideological. A         graduate of American University, Cohn is a little bit like         the   brawnier younger brother to         Blankfein.       ’ ’         Cohn made and left his mark first as a trader, and then as         the chief operating officer, making sure the highly         functional bureaucracy of the global banking giant runs         efficiently and managing internal rivalries —  not as a           strategist or the public face of the firm.       ’ ’  ’ ’           The National Economic Council is a much different type of           operation. It’s a  and           influence sorter. As such, it is perfect for habitués of           what used to be a secretive private partnership. It           doesn’t have a large workforce of   offices to           manage. The director doesn’t have to be bothered much           with operations, personnel,   and           pointless meetings. The job is twofold. First, the NEC           director serves as one of the administration’s             whisperers —  talking to CEOs, drumming up           outside support for policies, providing comfort to           executives who might be concerned about the president’s           policies and behavior. Second, the director functions as           a sort of traffic cop and counselor for the conflicting           power centers of policy and analysis within the           administration. The job consists largely of sitting in           very nice conference rooms, entertaining visitors seeking           favors, attending   conferences, cajoling peers,           participating in phone calls, and leaking selectively to           favored press.         ’ ’           It’s kind of like being the CEO of a big investment           bank —  except without the big salary         ’
