President Donald Trump broke the Internet once again during the inauguration of the Global Center for Combating Extremist Ideology Sunday in Riyadh, the capital of Saudi Arabia. [To signify the official start to the facility’s operations, Trump touched a brightly lit globe with Saudi King Salman bin Abdulaziz and Egypt’s president Abdel Fatah  . An   Saudi TV screen grab quickly went viral, with the Internet quickly dubbing the object “the Trump orb. ”  And, just like that, a meme was born.
