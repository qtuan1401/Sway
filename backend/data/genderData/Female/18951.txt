Monday in Omaha, NE, at a rally for Democratic presidential nominee Hillary Clinton, while commenting on the back and forth between Khizr Khan, the father of fallen U. S. Army Capt. Humayun Khan and Republican presidential nominee Donald Trump, Berkshire Hathaway CEO Warren Buffett said “I ask Donald Trump, have you no sense decency, sir?”  Discussing the controversy, Buffett said, “When I heard that, my mind went back —  and this goes back before most of you were born —  but it went back to the McCarthy hearings. And at the time of the McCarthy hearings —  at the time of the senate McCarthy hearings with the Army, Joe Welch had a young assistant of his maligned by Senator McCarthy. And Senator McCarthy went on and on implying this guy was a communist and doing all kinds of things. And finally Joe Welch couldn’t take it anymore and he said, I’ll quote him, ‘Have you no sense of decency, sir? I ask Donald Trump, have you no sense decency, sir? And I might add just one thing —  McCarthy’s career went straight downhill after that. ” Follow Pam Key on Twitter @pamkeyNEN
