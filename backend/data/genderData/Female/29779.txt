.@BretBaier: Trump has passed the point of his past being a drag on himhttps:  .  Monday on Fox News Channel’s “Fox  Friends,” Bret Baier, host of “Special Report,” argued that presumptive Republican presidential nominee Donald Trump’s past is no longer a drag on him because he had already passed the point where the electorate would judge him for his past.  “I think that Donald Trump has passed the point of his past being really a drag on him because now he is this vessel of kick over the table and both parties aren’t working in Washington,” Baier said. “I think he has some hurdles to get over from explaining this stuff and the whole thing that he was the public relations guys and that it wasn’t him and that it was him and it’s kind of messy. All of that as far as voters  —   I don’t think we’ve seen throughout this primary that that affects him at all. ” Follow Jeff Poor on Twitter @jeff_poor
