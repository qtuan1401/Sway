(Want to get this briefing by email? Here’s the  .) Good evening. Here’s the latest. 1. It was a remarkable moment in the   relationship, and for Secretary of State John Kerry. With 23 days left in office, Mr. Kerry dropped diplomatic niceties and harshly criticized Israel over settlements, arguing that they imperil the   solution. Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu is blaming the United States for orchestrating last week’s Security Council resolution condemning the settlements. The United States denies doing so. Mr. Kerry appears to have concluded there is nothing left to lose, and he spoke knowing the new administration may well abandon   American negotiating positions. _____ 2. Nearly 200 Homeland Security employees and contractors have accepted almost $15 million in bribes to let immigrants and drugs into the country over the last decade. That was our finding after a review of thousands of court records and internal agency documents. The employees sold green cards, gave sensitive information to drug cartels and looked the other way as drugs and people crossed the border. _____ 3. Women who took fish oil during the last three months of pregnancy significantly lowered the risk that their children would develop asthma, a new study found. But the researchers say the study should be replicated before doctors recommend that pregnant women routinely take fish oil. Doctors are eager to find ways to prevent the chronic disease, which is on the rise in developed countries. _____ 4. A wild Christmas Party at a beach in Sydney, Australia, drew more than 10, 000 people who left behind 16 tons of trash. The huge mess prompted officials to ban alcohol at the beach for the remainder of the Australian summer. “By late evening, it got so bad that we let the shark alarm off three times to try to get the swimmers out of the water,” said a community patrolman. “They were all intoxicated. ” _____ 5. Each December, predictions of next year’s hottest food items barrel forth. We’re hearing jackfruit, sorghum and harissa are about to have their moment. And don’t ignore horseradish, spirulina and   breakfasts. Here’s a look at food trends over the last 20 years (remember bubble tea? So 2002) and a deeper exploration of the dark and often dubious work of   forecasting. _____ 6.   Donald Trump’s promise to impose high tariffs on American companies that manufacture goods abroad could take aim at his own brand, and his daughter’s as well. Much of the Ivanka Trump apparel on sale at Saks Off Fifth in New York on a recent visit was made in Indonesia, Vietnam or China. And at Trump Tower, a cap made in Bangladesh was on sale for $35. _____ 7. Tributes continue to pour in for Carrie Fisher, who played Princess Leia in “Star Wars. ” She died Tuesday at age 60. Our film critic remembers Ms. Fisher for changing a popular understanding of female heroism, calling her the “foremother of Hermione Granger and Katniss Everdeen and of countless   Disney princesses. ” And many fans remembered Ms. Fisher, who was candid about her struggles with bipolar disorder, by speaking out on Twitter about their experiences with mental illness. _____ 8. Fentanyl has surpassed heroin to become the deadliest drug on Long Island, where the number of fatalities are part of a national pattern. The synthetic opioid is often prescribed to cancer patients and can be 100 times more potent than morphine. “It’s essentially the serial killer of drugs,” said one addiction counselor. _____ 9. Among our   articles today: The Marine Corps taught one recruit how to kill, but not how to come home. Our deep dive looks at the case of a young marksman who landed in prison after he returned from Afghanistan. He was so drunk, he didn’t remember the violent act that landed him there. His lawyers’ strategy of using PTSD and alcoholism as a defense initially failed. _____ 10. Finally, a proposal for a new kind of New Year’s resolution. Our tech experts say you should be focusing on a different kind of fitness in 2017: your tech fitness. Are your passwords outdated? Or worse, are your devices not  ? Where are you storing old devices? Are your batteries optimized? The time is now to clean up and cast out  —   in an environmentally friendly manner, of course. _____ Photographs may appear out of order for some readers.
