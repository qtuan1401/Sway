’  ’ ’   In the wake of Hillary Clinton’s election loss, Bernie Sanders is   urging the Democratic Party to reassess its relationship with     voters. ’ ’   In a  published on Thursday, Sanders addressed the loss the   Democratic Party suffered with voters in states like   Pennsylvania, Wisconsin, and Ohio that Donald Trump successfully   courted away from Clinton. ’ ’   ”The simple truth  —   and Mr. Trump tapped into this  —   is that   millions of Americans are working longer hours for lower wages,   they’re worried to death about the future for their children and   they want an economy that works for all of us, not just the 1   percent,” the statement read. ’ ’   ”The Democratic Party has got to make it very clear that it is   the party of working people in 50 states in this country, not   just in New York and California. We’ve got a lot of work to do,”   Sanders continued. ’ ”   Trump’s stunning victory fueled speculation that the Democratic   Party would be   to understand the results of this year’s   presidential election. ” ’’ ’   In an interview on CNN’’s ”The Situation Room” Thursday, Sanders   reiterated that the Democratic Party did not do enough to appeal   to voters in economically constrained rural areas of the US and   must work to gain their trust in the future. ’ ’   ”People are angry. They have a right to be angry, but we have got   to channel that anger against people who caused the decline of   the middle class and so many people living in poverty  —   not take   it out on our neighbors who are Muslim, or Latino or women,”   Sanders said. ’ ’   In a Tweet on Thursday, Sanders also vowed to oppose any   inflammatory rhetoric Trump may use during his presidency. ’ ’   ”If Donald Trump takes people’’s anger and turns it against   Muslims, Hispanics,   and women, we will be his   worst nightmare,” Sanders wrote. ’
