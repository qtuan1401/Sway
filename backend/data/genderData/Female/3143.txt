(Want to get this briefing by email? Here’s the  .) Good evening. Here’s the latest. 1. More fallout from Britain’s vote to leave the European Union: Boris Johnson, the former mayor of London and a “Brexit” supporter widely seen as the top candidate to take over the Conservative Party and succeed Prime Minister David Cameron, has decided not to run. Michael Gove, the justice secretary who recently said he didn’t have the talent or desire to become prime minister, is officially in the race. He’ll face Theresa May, the home secretary, and several other candidates vying for the position. The vote may threaten London’s days as the world’s financial capital. _____ 2. The Brexit decision by British voters was partly motivated by anxiety about immigration, and in the United States, Donald J. Trump has called for a temporary ban on Muslim immigrants. But there is a country where the government can hardly keep up with the demand to welcome refugees: Canada. Citizens are banding together and essentially adopting families, which they’ve been doing by the thousands. _____ 3. The deadly attack on Istanbul’s main airport, above, was carried out by three suicide bombers from Russia, Uzbekistan and Kyrgyzstan, Turkish officials said. The government has blamed Islamic State militants for the attack on Tuesday. If the group is responsible, it would be the first time any   members have attacked a major Western target  —   and would indicate that Turkey is no longer protected from the group’s violence. One of the victims killed was in Turkey to find and save his son from ISIS. _____ 4. Republicans are raising questions about a meeting between Bill Clinton and Attorney General Loretta E. Lynch, saying it could compromise the investigation into Hillary Clinton’s email practices. Ms. Lynch said Mr. Clinton walked uninvited from his plane to her government plane on Monday to say hello, but that the two did not discuss any cases. But Republican lawmakers said the meeting was troubling. _____ 5. The driver of a Tesla Model S was killed in what may be the first death involving a   car. Federal regulators, who have opened an investigation, say the car was driving in “autopilot” mode when it crashed into a   at a Florida intersection on May 7. _____ 6. Adnan Syed, whose murder trial was featured on the podcast “Serial,” will get a new trial, a judge in Maryland ruled on Thursday. The inmate’s conviction for the 1999 killing of his   gained widespread attention after his case was featured in the first season of the podcast. Mr. Syed, who was serving a life sentence, had long maintained his innocence. _____ 7. Chris Christie for vice president? The governor of New Jersey, who has become one of Donald J. Trump’s most influential advisers, is being vetted as a possible running mate. Meanwhile, Mr. Trump’s promise to crack down on trade agreements that hurt American jobs has highlighted the fact that, as a businessman, he had relied on and benefited from the same type of cheap foreign labor that he now scorns. _____ 8. Transgender people can now serve openly in the U. S. armed forces. Defense Secretary Ashton B. Carter, above, lifted the Pentagon’s ban on Thursday, continuing a transformation of the military. An analysis of federal and state data has doubled the number of transgender adults in the U. S. putting the new estimate at about 1. 4 million people. _____ 9. If this weekend brings a lot of lamenting about noisy fireworks, take comfort: Quiet firework displays will maybe, one day, become a thing. In parts of Europe, it already is. The quiet displays can be more colorful, but alas, they are not big enough to entertain a large audience. They’ve not made their way to the U. S. yet, so for the time being, keep covering your ears. _____ 10. Perhaps a bowl of Kellogg’s Corn Flakes with a little lemon zest dusted on top will be a good value at $7. 50. Perhaps it won’t. As the breakfast food continues to fall out of favor, Kellogg’s is hoping a boutique cafe in Times Square that serves cereal, but with garnishes like green tea powder, will get people to look differently at the flakes and oats. Be prepared to pay Manhattan prices, though. _____ 11. Let’s do some math. If the average American spends 10 hours and 39 minutes a day consuming various types of media on various types of devices, how much time does that leave him or her for other things  —   like work, sleep or maybe sitting for a meal? A Nielsen study, which indicates that Americans really, really love television, doesn’t answer that question. But, whatever, that “Game of Thrones” finale was worth it. _____ 12. Leila. Liina. Lily. (Their last name is Luik.) The three sisters from Estonia, who call themselves the Trio for Rio, are believed to be the first triplets to qualify for the Olympics. The marathon contenders didn’t even begin running seriously until six years ago, when they were 24. “We show that it is never too late to start a professional career,” Liina Luik said. _____ Your Evening Briefing is posted at 6 p. m.
