Once again, frontrunner Donald Trump is proving to the Republican base that, unlike the Establishment GOP, he is willing to do what is necessary to win, even if it means bringing up a subject the corrupt DC Media has declared off limits. The subject, of course, is Hillary’s (and the media’s) appalling double standards on the issue of the War on Women.  Using a clip from one of Hillary’s most famous speeches, one from 1995 where she equated women’s rights to human rights, this   Trump video puts Hillary’s words over images of the Clintons’ sick reality: photos of Monica Lewinsky,   Bill Cosby, and   Anthony Weiner, who is married to Huma Abedein, Hillary’s chief aide.  —   Hillary and her friends! A video posted by Donald J. Trump (@realdonaldtrump) on Jan 7, 2016 at 9:19am PST,   —   MSNBC just played the video. After it was over, longtime Hillary Clinton supporter Andrea Mitchell just sat there with her mouth hanging open. In 2012, with the help of their DC Media allies, Democrats accused Romney of murder, not paying his taxes, and blamed him for Todd Akin. This is what the Republican Base has been waiting 8 long years for: a Republican who will finally(!) take it to the other side with same  energy and audacity they hit us with. This is how you win elections, folks. You either keep Democrats and their media on defense, or you lose.   Follow John Nolte on Twitter @NolteNC
