Hollywood celebrities took to social media Tuesday evening ready to celebrate what initially looked to be a victory for Democratic presidential candidate Hillary Clinton, who led Republican Donald Trump in most polls headed into Election Day  —   but were left to vent their frustration and horror when Trump pulled off an historic upset. [Many of Clinton’s top celebrity supporters  —   including some who had hit the trail alongside her during her campaign’s closing stretch, like Katy Perry and Lady Gaga  —   expressed their shock on Twitter Tuesday night as Trump appeared headed for victory.  Below is a sampling of some of Hollywood’s reaction to Trump’s win. Some of the tweets contain some salty language.
