’  ’ ’   House Speaker Paul Ryan met with Ivanka Trump in New York City on   Monday at her request, according to a source familiar with the   meeting. ’ ’   The source told Business Insider that Ivanka Trump, daughter of   Republican presidential nominee Donald Trump, shared campaign   updates with Ryan during the “productive conversation. ” ’ ’   The meeting took place at the the New York Economic Club where   Ryan delivered a speech. ’ ’   Ryan also shared with Ivanka Trump what he learned when he was on   the 2012 Republican ticket as the party’s nominee for vice   president, the source said. ’ ”   The relationship between Ryan and the Trump family has not always   been great. The Wisconsin Republican famously declined for weeks   to endorse Trump after he clinched the GOP nomination earlier   this year. Ryan has also at times publicly condemned some of   Trump’s fiery rhetoric.  ” ’   The meeting comes as Donald Trump enters the final leg of the   presidential campaign. The   mogul is set to debate   Hillary Clinton, his Democratic opponent, for the first time next   week. ’
