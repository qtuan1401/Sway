’  ’ ’   Over the past year, the  presidential election has caused a   lot of stress for many Americans, whether it’’s   about  on the   border,  or Donald Trump’’s comments about grabbing   women ”.”  ’ ’   If you’’re feeling anxious, you’’re not alone. In  by the American Psychological Association   (APA) over half of American adults reported that the election is   ”a very or somewhat significant source of stress.”  ’ ’   ’ ’  ’ ’  ’ ’  ’ ’  ’ ’  ’ ’   This type of anxiety actually has a name: Election Stress   Disorder.  ’ ”   If you’re experiencing stress leading up to Election Day, here   are Wright’s recommendations: ” ”   Take a break from the internet or social media, since your feed   is likely full of election posts. Of course, it’s good   to stay informed about the candidates, but distracting   yourself from thoughts about the election is a   helpful way to avoid stress. For example, if you normally   read 10 articles about Trump or Hillary per day, Wright suggests   trying to limit your intake to one or two until Tuesday. ” ”   Seeking out social support is also key, Wright says. If you   remain isolated, you’re more likely to dwell on worries about the   election, or read more posts on social media. By spending   time with friends and family, you can focus your attention   elsewhere and have conversations about   things. ” ’   And, of course, there are other general     activities you can try, such as remembering to take deep   breaths when feeling anxious, taking walks, getting exercise   () making sure you get enough   sleep, and eating healthy.  ’ ’   But the best   stress management strategy,   Wright adds, is casting your ballot early. ’ ’   When people vote early, ”they don’’t feel as compelled   to be informed. They let it go and pay attention to something   else, because they’’ve already made their decision,” she says. ”So   be proactive  —   go vote.” ’
