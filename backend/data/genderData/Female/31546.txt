Orlando terrorist Omar Mateen supported presumptive Democratic nominee for president Hillary Rodham Clinton because he opposed the presidential candidacy of presumptive GOP nominee Donald J. Trump. [Mateen’s friend Mohammed Malik revealed Mateen’s support for Hillary Clinton in a Washington Post essay this week. Malik wrote:  We talked about the presidential election and debated our views of the candidates that were running  —   he liked Hillary Clinton and I liked Bernie Sanders. This banter continued through texts and phone calls for several months. My last conversation with Omar was by phone in  . He called me while he was at the beach with his son to tell me about a vacation he’d taken with his father to Orlando the previous weekend. He’d been impressed by the local mosque. Malik revealed, in a   interview with NBC News, the reason why Mateen —  his friend who would go on to slaughter 49 people in an Orlando nightclub in the name of the Islamic State after pledging allegiance to its leader Abu Bakr   —  supported Hillary Clinton for president. “Mateen told him he liked Hillary Clinton because he wanted a candidate who could beat Donald Trump in November,” NBC News reported from their interview with Malik.
