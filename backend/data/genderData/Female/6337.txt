  Donald J. Trump and his daughter Ivanka met with former Vice President Al Gore on Monday to discuss   climate change. And a   believer finds the truth at a pizza parlor.  Al Gore thought he would be bending the ear of the adviser Mr. Trump trusts most, his daughter Ivanka. Instead, the man bearing “The Inconvenient Truth” went straight to the source: the   himself. “I had a lengthy and very productive session with the ” Mr. Gore, the former vice president, told reporters at Trump Tower. “It was a sincere search for areas of common ground. I had a meeting beforehand with Ivanka Trump. The bulk of the time was with the   Donald Trump. I found it an extremely interesting conversation, and to be continued. ” Hundreds of scientists are also telling Mr. Trump in a new letter that climate change is real and needs to be addressed: “We urge you to decide if you want your presidency to be defined by denial and disaster, or acceptance and action,” says the new letter, which will be sent on Tuesday and has already been signed by 700 scientists and academics from related disciplines. The letter lists six steps the   can take to help protect the nation’s “economy, national security, and public health and safety. ” Getting Mr. Trump, who has called climate change a hoax perpetrated by the Chinese, to turn around on the issue might not be as unlikely as his public statements would make it seem. It may come down to who has his ear last. It must have felt familiar to Mr. Gore, confronting a   who had just lost the popular vote but won the Electoral College. In point of fact, Mr. Gore’s loss to George W. Bush pales in comparison with Hillary Clinton’s. If you’re still counting, Mrs. Clinton’s popular vote lead over Mr. Trump climbed to 2, 597, 156 over the weekend, five times Mr. Gore’s final lead over Mr. Bush. And at 2 percentage points, Mrs. Clinton’s lead has equaled Jimmy Carter’s victory spread over Gerald Ford in 1976. On Tuesday, House Democrats will convene a forum on the “Electoral College and the Future of American Democracy. ” No word on whether they will be picking up the tab to move Californians to Florida and Ohio. The electoral recriminations keep rolling in. A former Breitbart News reporter claimed last night on Facebook that he planted Clinton hecklers at her rallies, and has since deleted the post. The gunman who stormed a Washington pizzeria on Sunday confirmed that he was motivated by online articles that convinced him that the restaurant, Comet Ping Pong, “was harboring sex slaves” and that he was “armed to help rescue them,” according to documents released at his arraignment. After the suspect, Edgar M. Welch, “found no evidence that underage children were being harbored in the restaurant,” he surrendered peacefully, the documents said. The truth now known, perhaps Mr. Welch could tell the son of the  ’s pick for national security adviser, who said on Twitter: Also, if he had kept his assault rifle stashed, the gunman could have enjoyed a pizza and a beer, but we Washingtonians understand the wait for a   table can be pretty long. The House majority leader said a   Congress would not support the  ’s vow to hit companies that move overseas with a hefty tariff on goods sent back to the United States. And House Speaker Paul D. Ryan hinted strongly that he wouldn’t go along either. “I don’t want to get into some kind of trade war,” Representative Kevin McCarthy of California, the majority leader, said in response to vehement threats by Mr. Trump over the weekend. Mr. Ryan echoed Mr. McCarthy’s view that an overhaul of the corporate tax code would better keep jobs in the United States than a punitive tariff on companies that send work abroad. “I think we can get at the goal here, which is keep American businesses American, build things in America and sell them overseas. That can be properly addressed in comprehensive tax reform,” the speaker told a Wisconsin reporter. In a storm of Twitter posts over the weekend, the   had been uncompromising on the proposal. An umbrella organization of Jewish groups is holding a Hanukkah party at the new Trump International Hotel in Washington, and one of its member groups is not too happy about it. “In the years to come, Jews in America are going to be regularly tested to make the right choices, and this is clearly not one of them,” wrote Peter Pepper and Ann Toback, the president and executive director of the Workmen’s Circle, in a letter to Malcolm Hoenlein, the executive vice chairman of the Conference of Presidents of Major American Jewish Organizations. In a telephone interview, Mr. Hoenlein said that the venue choice had been made by the partner for the party, the Azerbaijani Embassy, and that it was one of the few places that would hold a kosher reception on short notice. “There’s no other significance to it,” Mr. Hoenlein said, adding that Mr. Trump is not yet president, “so there’s no conflict. ” Of course, that partner, Azerbaijan, isn’t terribly popular either. Mr. Trump has a message to the news media: Cover him the way he wants or he’ll just have to keep tweeting  —   regardless of the consequences. The  ’s victory tour started with a bang in Cincinnati when he took a shot at Gov. John Kasich of Ohio and prompted the crowd into another round of “Lock her up” by saying how much he enjoyed beating up on Mrs. Clinton. The next dates are out: ■ Crown Coliseum in Fayetteville, N. C. at 7 p. m. Tuesday ■   Hall in Des Moines at 7 p. m. Central time Thursday. ■ DeltaPlex Arena in Grand Rapids, Mich. at 7 p. m. Friday Retired Marine Corps Gen. James N. Mattis may have led the 1st Marine Division during the invasion of Iraq and later oversaw the campaign for Falluja, but he now thinks the Iraq War was a mistake. “Ladies and gentlemen,” the  ’s choice to be secretary of defense told a conference in California, according to an audio tape obtained by The Intercept, “we will probably look back on the invasion of Iraq as a mistake  —   as a strategic mistake. ” Perhaps not coincidentally, Mr. Trump  —   his boss, should he be confirmed by the Senate  —   had a similar change of views on the war, though the   has famously insisted he always opposed the invasion. Several groups who favor limiting immigration are voicing their opposition to Representative Michael McCaul as a potential secretary of homeland security, saying the Texas Republican has been weak on border security. Mr. McCaul, the chairman of the House Homeland Security Committee, has been a frequent critic of what he says is the Obama administration’s failure to adequately combat the Islamic State. But groups like the Center for Immigration Studies say Mr. McCaul’s efforts on border security and immigration have been weak and counterproductive. “He’s been the chairman of this critical committee and never tried to push through legislation that adequately addresses border security, immigration and homeland security,” said Jessica M. Vaughan, the director of policy studies at the center. The real aim may be less about opposing Mr. McCaul than opening a lane for the group’s homeland security chief of choice: Mr. Kobach, the Kansas secretary of state. The Federation for American Immigration Reform did not directly oppose Mr. McCaul but said the next secretary of the Department of Homeland Security needed to be someone who would implement real border and immigration security. “If Representative McCaul is chosen to head D. H. S. he will need to take a much more expansive view of border and immigration enforcement than he has in the past,” said Dan Stein, the president of the federation.
