[From Bloomberg:  Hillary gets the vote from America’s richest citizens. Or at least she’s getting their cash. Former Secretary of State and Democratic presidential candidate Hillary Clinton has collected $21. 1 million for her campaign and its supporting political action committees from 17 U. S. donors on the Bloomberg Billionaires Index. Republican Donald Trump has received $1. 02 million from 12 members of the group. While the role the wealthiest play in American politics has come under increased scrutiny with growing attention to income inequality fueling the rise of populist candidates, contributions from U.

Soros is the   person in the country with $24. 7 billion, according to the index. The   of hedge fund Renaissance Technologies  —   and former NSA codebreaker  —   James Simons, is the   spender, giving $7 million to Clinton. Read the rest here.
