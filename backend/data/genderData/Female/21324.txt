There is little evidence suggesting that there is a late surge for Marco Rubio, according to the latest Des Moines   poll. [Bloomberg News reporter Joshua Green analyzed the latest polling information during an interview on Breitbart News Sunday on the evening before the Iowa caucus.  He dismissed the buzz coming out of Washington D. C. suggesting that the Florida senator was surging right before the Republican primary caucus. “There is no surge,” he said in an interview with Breitbart News Chairman Stephen K. Bannon on Sirius XM Patriot channel 125. “There is no evidence of anything like that. ” Green pointed out that a “surge” was what happened to former Senator Rick Santorum in 2012, as the poll showed him with a big jump in support in the days before the caucus. Nothing he saw in the current data, suggested that something similar was happening with Rubio. “There is no evidence of anything like that,” he said. He said that Rubio began in the single digits and managed to raise his polling numbers about five or six points before ending up with 15 percent. “I wouldn’t call that a surge, it’s more of a gentle incline,” he said. He agreed with Bannon that there was a lot of noise coming from Rubio supporters suggesting a surge  —   but the Iowa caucus was a fight between Cruz and Trump. “The fight for Iowa is really between Cruz and Trump. There’s no other fight going on except for I guess this imaginary Rubio thing,” he concluded. Listen to the entire interview below:
