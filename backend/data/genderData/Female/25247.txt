In an appearance on Wednesday’s “Fox  Friends,” Republican presidential   Donald Trump reacted to rhetoric that appeared to be aimed at him during last night’s State of the Union address from President Barack Obama and during the Republican response from Gov. Nikki Haley ( ).  On Obama, Trump said he was living in a “fantasy land” when it comes to the seriousness of the threats facing the country. However, as for Haley, he took her to task for weak on immigration and for having sought campaign contributions from him in the past. “She’s weak on illegal immigration, and she certainly has no trouble asking me for campaign contributions, ‘cause over the years she’s asked me for a hell of a lot of money in campaign contributions. So, you know, it’s sort of interesting to hear,” he continued. “Perhaps, if I weren’t running she’d be in my office asking for money. But now that I’m running, she wants to take a weak side on immigration. I feel very strongly about illegal immigration. She doesn’t, and I think the people in her great state, I love her state, I’m there a lot, and by the way I have a massive lead in South Carolina. We have a massive lead. They’re incredible people, and they feel like I do. Believe me. Because they don’t like what’s happening in our country. ” Trump was also asked about the potential of a   GOP presidential ticket, to which Trump seemingly dismissed. “We’ll pick somebody, but we’ll pick somebody who’s very good,” he replied. “But whoever I pick is going to be very strong on illegal immigration. We’ve had it. We’ve had it with illegal immigration. ” Follow Jeff Poor on Twitter @jeff_poor
