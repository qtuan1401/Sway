’  ’ ”   ESPN radio announcer Dan Le Batard on Monday criticized   ESPN for its policy for covering President Donald Trump’s    ” ’  ’ ’  ’ ’   ”I understand what ESPN is doing with these memos,” Le Batard   said . ”They don’’t want to open the door so that everyone at ESPN   is talking politics instead of sports in a way that alienates.   But I think the way we are doing it is weak.” ’ ’   Le Batard described the way ESPN would like its employees to   discuss the issue, saying ”Stay in your lane, stay in this corner   as some things that are happening around American that feel   hugely   have people protesting in the streets in a way   that shuts down airports. It just feels unbelievably weak to me   to only talk about this through the prism [of sports]. . .. This   feels like the weakest possible way that ESPN can enter this   discussion.” ’ ’’ ’   Le Batard said that the ”blanket edict” is a reaction to Bill   Simmons, who famously called out ESPN for its coverage of the   NFL, saying they don’’t want one employee going ”rogue” and making   certain people feel uncomfortable. ’ ’   ”I feel like you gotta trust your people at some point to   talk about some things in this country that aren’’t sports   related,” Le Batard said. ’ ’   He also called out ”SportsCenter” anchor  post on Monday.   Steele criticized the crowds of protestors outside of LAX   Airport, saying that while it wasn’’t a big deal for her to miss   her flight because of the protests, it hurt others, including   immigrants. ’ ’   Le Batard referred to the issues creating ”     crime” ’ ’   Le Batard has certainly never held back on subjects, but it will   be interesting to see how ESPN handles this round criticism. ’ ’ESPN radio announcer Dan Le Batard on Monday. ..’
