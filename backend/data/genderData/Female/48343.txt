’  ’ ’   Hillary Clinton’’s campaign released a statement on Friday saying   that it is ”pleased” that the FBI  related to its investigation   of the Democratic presidential nominee’’s use of a private email   server. ’ ’   ”We are pleased that the FBI has released the materials from   Hillary Clinton’’s interview, as we had requested,” Brian Fallon,   press secretary for the Clinton campaign, said in a statement. ’ ’   ”While her use of a single email account was clearly a mistake   and she has taken responsibility for it, these materials make   clear why the Justice Department believed there was no basis to   move forward with this case,” he said. ’ ’   The FBI did not recommend that the Justice Department file   charges against Clinton for her use of a private server while she   was secretary of state, but Director James Comey said that   Clinton was ”extremely careless” in handling classified   information. ’ ”   Republican presidential nominee Donald Trump’s campaign also   released a statement about the FBI documents, unsurprisingly   making the opposite argument. ” ’’ ’   ”Hillary Clinton is applying for a job that begins each day with   a top secret intelligence briefing, and the notes from her FBI   interview reinforce her tremendously bad judgment and   dishonesty,” Jason Miller, a senior communications adviser for   the Trump campaign, said in a statement. ”Clinton’’s secret email   server was an end run around government transparency laws that   wound up jeopardizing our national security and sensitive   diplomatic efforts.” ’ ’   He continued: ”Clinton’’s reckless conduct and dishonest attempts   to avoid accountability show she cannot be trusted with the   presidency and its chief obligation as    of the   U. S. armed forces.” ’
