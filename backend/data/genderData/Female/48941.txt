’  ’ ’   Fox News host Shepard Smith took a slight swipe at     mogul Matt Drudge  published Monday. ’ ’   In the interview, Ryan Grim, Huffington Post Washington bureau   chief, recalled two very different narratives that played out   earlier this month during coverage of Hurricane Matthew. ’ ’   Smith took the storm seriously and  for people in its path to   evacuate. ’ ”   Drudge, on the other hand, suggested the government had   exaggerated the intensity of the hurricane to gin up fear over   global warming. To push his narrative, Drudge posted a link to   Smith’s   warning as evidence the media and government were   overhyping the storm. ” ’   Asked about Drudge’’s coverage of Hurricane Matthew, Smith   suggested he was ”a bit embarrassed” for Grim. ’ ’’ ’   ”You follow Matt Drudge, for the record,” the Fox News host   quipped. ’ ”   Drudge has been the subject of strong criticism this election   cycle. In his efforts to promote Donald Trump, the internet titan   has often resorted to pushing conspiracy theories to discount the     mogul’s opponents. ” ”   Smith’s comments on Drudge were part of a larger interview about   Smith’s role at Fox News. The longtime host discussed a variety   of issues with The Huffington Post, including the future of the   network following the departure of founding CEO Roger Ailes. ”
