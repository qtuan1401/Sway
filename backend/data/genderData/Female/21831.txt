What kind of attacks got under Hillary Clinton’s skin at the first presidential debate? [Clinton appeared to maintain   composure while her opponent, Donald Trump, was speaking she held a steady gaze towards him, smiled each time she prepared to speak, and, at times, appeared to take notes.  Clinton habitually smiles broadly every time an opponent unleashes an attack on an issue on which she is weak, demonstrated by her reactions on trade, raising taxes, and adding more regulations. But there were a few moments that she flashed looks of bewildered amusement or disdain, as Trump discussed his taxes, the birther issue, his position on the Iraq war, and foreign policy: “Just listen to what you’ve heard,” she said at one point with disbelief, as her supporters in the audience laughed. Several times, she resisted her natural impulses to interrupt and fire back at Trump and let him continue speaking. “I have a feeling by the end of the evening, I’m going to be blamed for everything that’s ever happened,” she said, smiling. “Why not?” Trump responded, as the audience laughed. At one point, Clinton giggled softly after moderator Lester Holt asked Trump what he meant when he said that she did not look presidential. Clinton became the most animated after Trump called her “totally out of control” in one of her campaign videos. “Whoo! Okay!” she said, as she jiggled her shoulders.
