Sunday on ABC’s “This Week,” political commentator Cokie Roberts said Democratic presidential   Hillary Clinton is having trouble with particularly young voters and noted that “more Romney supporters are for Trump than Obama supporters are for Hillary. ”  Roberts said, “And it’s having a huge impact, if you look in this poll. Not only are young people off of Hillary Clinton completely, but people like Bill Kristol who said, you know, find somebody as an alternative to Trump, the voters aren’t saying that. More Romney supporters are for Trump than Obama supporters are for Hillary. ” Follow Pam Key on Twitter @pamkeyNEN
