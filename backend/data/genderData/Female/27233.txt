Monday in Rhode Island, Republican presidential   Donald Trump said the alliance between Gov. John Kasich ( ) and Sen. Ted Cruz ( ) shows they “weak” and “pathetic. ”  Trump said, “Did you see the news today? Did you see where they ban together and collusion? If you collude in business or if you collude in the stock market, they put you in jail. If politics, because it is a rigged system, because it is a corrupt enterprise, if politics you are allowed to collude. They colluded and actually, I was happy because it shows how weak they are. It shows how pathetic they are. ” Follow Pam Key on Twitter @pamkeyNEN
