Can Donald Trump sweep the battleground states and pick off a “blue” state like Michigan   New Hampshire to shock the political world tonight?  There is also plenty at stake in the   races as both parties fight to control the Senate. Democrats need to gain four seats to control the Senate if Hillary Clinton wins the White House or five seats if Trump wins. And regardless of what happens in the election, look for the usual mainstream media hacks, liberals, and their   allies on the right to immediately use whatever excuse they can find to aggressively push more amnesty and “immigration reform” with unlimited   visas for foreign workers. The media will also put a spotlight on the battles on the right even though there may be as much discord on left after tonight. Stay tuned to Breitbart News throughout the evening and morning.

He says he has just received a call from Secretary Clinton. “She congratulated us  …     on our victory, and I congratulated her and her family on a very, very   campaign,” he says. Trump says Hillary has worked very long and very hard over a long period of time and we owe her a “major debt of gratitude for her service to our country. Now it’s time for America to bind the wounds of division  …    ” Trump says to all Republicans, Democrats, and independents to come together as one, united people.

He says it was a movement made up of people of all races, religions, and backgrounds who want the government to serve them.

While all the other “strategists” gibbered about Trump losing the Hispanic vote, Marlow said: “Trump is growing the big tent.   …     Trump’s policies are appealing to blacks. There are even some polls out there, like a survey USA poll, saying Trump is actually doing fine with Latinos. ” In the Nevada primary on Tuesday, Trump not only won the Hispanic vote he not only won 17 points more of the Hispanic vote than his next closest rival but his Latino vote nearly matched that of the two Latino candidates combined. In one of the few times you might have heard this point expressed on television airwaves, Marlow said that the No. 1 issue for Breitbart News’ 20 million readers, “has consistently been  —   since last year  —   immigration. They are looking for someone who is going to seal the border and prioritize border security as No. 1. ” Obviously, Marlow was right about everything. According to Nexis, that was the last time he appeared on TV. It would be as if, after discovering America, Christopher Columbus reported back to the King and Queen of Spain, but the booker for Ferdinand and Isabella decided that, instead of Columbus, she’d get the guy who never actually set sail for the New World because he was afraid he’d fall off the edge of the Earth into a fiery pit. 11:32: Game, Set, Match?

About a quarter of voters surveyed said the debates were the most important factor in their decision in a country in which 69% of voters said they were either “angry” or “dissatisfied” with the federal government. The electorate was   for Trump’s   message on trade,   and immigration. But Trump never effectively made that case when he had the most number of eyeballs on him during the debates, which generated Super   audiences. If Trump loses tonight, it may well be because he didn’t prepare for the debates and left so many points on the field in light of the mood of the electorate, according to the   online exit poll that found (say what you want about Trump supporter Bill Belichick,  but he would have never ever let one of his players be as unprepared as Trump, who seemed like a player who did not even take the time to read his team’s playbook, was during his three debates):  —   75 percent agree that “America needs a strong leader to take the country back from the rich and powerful. ” —   72 percent agree “the American economy is rigged to advantage the rich and powerful. ” —   68 percent agree that “traditional parties and politicians don’t care about people like me. ” —   76 percent believe “the mainstream media is more interested in making money than telling the truth. ” —   57 percent feel that “more and more, I don’t identify with what America has become. ” —   54 percent feel “it is increasingly hard for someone like me to get ahead in America. ” 5:35: Get ready for the usual suspects to push more amnesty: Exit poll has   silly ”legalize or deport” immig. question, according to voter who took it.
