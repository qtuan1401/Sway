Being Donald Trump’s running mate ”extremely undesirable to me, as is any government post”    @RealBenCarson https:  .  Monday on CNN’s “New Day,” former Johns Hopkins neurosurgeon Dr. Ben Carson, a former candidate for the Republican nomination now supporting presumptive GOP nominee Donald Trump, discussed Trump’s search for a running mate for this fall’s general election.  Carson said he had been misrepresented in a report that alleged he had revealed Trump’s potential running mates. However, when asked if he was interested in being Trump’s VP pick, Carson dismissed the suggestion. “This is something that is extremely undesirable to me, as is any government post quite frankly,” Carson responded. “I believe that citizen statesmen can work from outside the government in a capacity where they contribute to the   of the country. ” Carson went on to add he would not be seeking elected office in the future.
