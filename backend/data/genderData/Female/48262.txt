’  ’ ”   Donald Trump’s campaign over the last two weeks has gone out of   its way to reach nonwhite voters. ” ”   It’s the first time in more than a year of crisscrossing the   country that the   mogul has spoken directly to     at large, and asked for their support. ” ”   Trump’s strategy for luring black voters into his orbit involved   mocking their schools, denigrating their neighborhoods, and    on the impact of youth   unemployment. ” ’   All of those points were bookended with phrases like, ”” ”,” and   ”Give Donald Trump a chance.” ’ ”   On Saturday, the Manhattan billionaire took news about NBA   champion Dwyane Wade’s family tragedy and turned it into : ” ’  ’ ”   Prominent black voices throughout the country have scolded   Trump’s outreach methods, calling them   and out of   touch. ” ’   ”I hear him not talking to black people, but talking to white   people about black people so they will think he cares about black   people,” former Atlanta newspaper publisher Alexis Scott  in a story published on Wednesday. ’ ’   Marc Morial, the president of the National Urban League, agreed,   telling The Times: ”Black America has deep problems . .. but black   America also has a large community of striving, successful,     people: college educated, in the work force.” ’ ’  ’ ”   Former GOP presidential candidate and Trump surrogate, Dr. Ben   Carson, was similarly unmoved by Trump’s strategy  —   which   included  ” ’   In an interview with The Daily Beast, the     neurosurgeon : “That’s what people do who   don’t have anything to talk about,” he said. ’ ”   Harvard University professor Jennifer Hochschild  that Trump’s efforts are all but useless, despite his   assertions that he can improve the economic outlook of black   voters. ” ’   ”General cluelessness about racial dynamics will diminish any   possible black support that comes from Trump’’s emphasis on job   creation,” she said. ’ ’   As the fall debates draw near, Trump continues to poll  among   voters. ’
