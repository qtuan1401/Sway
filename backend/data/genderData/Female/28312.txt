San Francisco Democrats will have to reach deeper into their pockets than ever before if they want to sit with George Clooney and Hillary Clinton at the presidential candidate’s Bay Area fundraiser dinner next month. Two seats at the head table with the guests of honor are going for a whopping $350, 000. [Bay   venture capitalist, Uber investor and Democrat moneyman Shervin Pishevar will host George and Amal Clooney and Hillary Clinton for a   fundraiser at his home on April 15 on what will be Clinton’s ninth fundraising trip to California.

All proceeds from both fundraisers will go toward the Hillary Victory Fund. Because the HVF is a   “joint fundraising committee” comprising multiple state party fundraising apparatuses as well as the larger Hillary for America fund, it can collect far more than the usual maximum individual contribution of $5, 400 ($2, 700 for the primary, and $2, 700 for the general).

Clooney has been a powerful spokesman for the Clinton campaign. In May, the    Hail, Casear! star told Fusion anchor Jorge Ramos he would help the   frontrunner’s campaign in “whatever way” he could. “I think she’s a tremendous candidate, Clooney told Ramos then. “I know her and I think the world of her. And I think I would be very happy if she were president. ” Earlier this week, Clooney penned a   letter on behalf of the Clinton campaign in which he bashed Republican presidential frontrunner Donald Trump, though he didn’t use the candidate’s name. “If you listen to the loudest voices out there today, you’d think we’re a country that hates Mexicans, hates Muslims, and thinks that committing war crimes is the best way to make America great again,” Clooney wrote. “The truth is that the only thing that would prevent America from being great would be to empower these voices. ” Clooney was a formidable fundraiser during President Obama’s reelection campaign. A fundraiser at the actor’s home in May 2011 brought in an astonishing $15 million for Obama’s campaign in just one night.
