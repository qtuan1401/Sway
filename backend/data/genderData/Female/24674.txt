Donald Trump is scheduled to speak with Impact Network President and CEO Bishop Wayne T. Jackson on Saturday in Detroit, Michigan to reach out to the African American community. [The Impact Network is the only African American owned and operated Christian television network that broadcasts across the nation.  “Mr. Trump will answer questions that are relevant to the African American community such as education (including HBCUs) unemployment, making our streets safe and creating better opportunities for all,” explained Pastor Mark Burns, a Trump supporter. The interview is set to air at 11 a. m. on Saturday. Burns added that Trump will also outline policies, which will impact disenfranchised minorities. “Citizens around the country will see, as I’ve have seen, the heart and compassion Mr. Trump has for all Americans, which includes minority communities whose votes have been taken for granted for far too long,” Burns stated. Burns joined Breitbart News Daily on SiriusXM Patriot Ch. 125 Monday morning and explained that the campaign chose to address the African American community on The Impact Network in Detroit because it will have “the greatest impact within the African America community. ” “This is a really exciting time for the Trump campaign,” Burns added. “So many doors within the African American community within this country have opened up for Mr. Trump and we were really just being strategic and make sure we chose the right place. ”
