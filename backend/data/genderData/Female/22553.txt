Hollywood weighed in on social media during Sunday night’s Democrat presidential debate, with many   celebrities loudly cheering for the insurgent Sen. Bernie Sanders as he squared off against Hillary Clinton and Martin O’Malley in South Carolina. [While some superstars like Katy Perry took to Twitter to reaffirm their support for Clinton, others praised the fiery Sanders, who sparred with Clinton on issues including healthcare, gun control, and the economy.  Michael Moore praised Sanders early and often, but said later on that any of the Democrats would be better than a GOP president: Young people know BS instantly. They have the best truth sniffer. Bernie just lays it all out, and that is refreshing to youth.  —   Michael Moore (@MMFlint) January 18, 2016,  Hillary preying on people’s fears about losing a health care fight to the Republicans instead of sounding like a leader willing to do battle,  —   Michael Moore (@MMFlint) January 18, 2016,  One thing’s for sure, you’ll never hear the issues that got discussed tonight being debated amongst the Republican candidates. #fear #invade,  —   Michael Moore (@MMFlint) January 18, 2016,  Mark Ruffalo, Sarah Silverman, and some others felt the Bern: . @BernieSanders is preferred   by young people because they know his means what he says.  —   Mark Ruffalo (@MarkRuffalo) January 18, 2016,  THIS https:  .   —   Sarah Silverman (@SarahKSilverman) January 18, 2016,  #FeelTheBern https:  .   —   Alyssa Milano (@Alyssa_Milano) January 18, 2016,  I love you Bernie! ”Trump thinks that Climate Change is a hoax invented by the Chinese”  —   Minnie Driver (@driverminnie) January 18, 2016,  Bernie doesn’t detour #highroad,  —   mia farrow (@MiaFarrow) January 18, 2016,  Black people check Sanders out,  —   Killer Mike (@KillerMike) January 18, 2016,  Bill Maher was bored, as was Arsenio Hall, who said the debate could benefit from the presence of a certain GOP candidate: Watching the Dems right now, its just not as much fun watching sane people debate.
