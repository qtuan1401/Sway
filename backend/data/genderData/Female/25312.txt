Saying it is “for my kids,” Cleveland Cavaliers star forward LeBron James has officially endorsed Democrat nominee Hillary Clinton for president of the United States. [Only days after Cavaliers owner Dan Gilbert may have cooperated in a fundraiser for GOP nominee Donald Trump, the single most powerful player in the NBA announced that he is all in for Hillary.  James insisted in his endorsement that Clinton was the best candidate for president because she was focused on “the children. ” The player made several claims about Hillary’s record including that she has been “working to improve public schools. ” Clinton does have a long history of supporting teachers unions, but less of a record of supporting the kind of reforms that could turn inner city schools around. She recently came out essentially in opposition to charter schools, and has long been against vouchers in order to burnish her union bona fides. James also lauded Clinton for her efforts to “make college a reality for more people in America. ” “My kids in Akron are proof of the hope and motivation that come from knowing college can be in their future, no matter what obstacles they might be facing,” James wrote in his editorial. But Hillary’s “free” college plan is one that even The New York Times reports says educators have expressed major doubts about. Even as Obamacare is collapsing all around the country, James also said he feels Hillary’s ideas to “expand access to health care” and enlarge Obamacare is the right plan for America. As he wrapped up his endorsement, James said: “Hillary is running on the message of hope and unity that we need” before urging fans to get out and vote in November.
