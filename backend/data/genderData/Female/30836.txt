Paul Manafort, Donald Trump’s campaign chairman, resigned from the campaign on Friday. [“This morning Paul Manafort offered, and I accepted, his resignation from the campaign. I am very appreciative for his great work in helping to get us where we are today, and in particular his work guiding us through the delegate and convention process. Paul is a true professional and I wish him the greatest success,” Trump stated in a press release on Friday.  Manafort’s resignation comes days after Stephen K. Bannon took a leave of absence from Breitbart News to serve as Trump’s campaign CEO and Kellyanne Conway was promoted to campaign manager. It also comes after numerous news reports surfaced about Manafort’s past work with Ukraine.
