Actor Leonardo DiCaprio will host Hillary Clinton for a   lunchtime fundraiser at his home in California later this month. [The event, billed a “Conversation with Hillary,” is set for August 23, according to Variety. Tickets reportedly cost $33, 400 per person, with proceeds going both directly to Clinton’s campaign and to support Democrat candidates in state and local races.  The    Revenant   is a frequent attendee at Clinton fundraisers, in Los Angeles and elsewhere. In June, DiCaprio joined in a   fundraiser dinner at Harvey Weinstein’s New York City home that brought in more than $1. 8 million for the Clinton campaign in just two hours. DiCaprio also turned up to a Clinton fundraiser hosted by fellow actor Tobey Maguire last summer. While in Los Angeles this month, Clinton will also attend a dinner fundraiser at the Beverly Hills home of billionaire entertainment mogul and Democratic Party   Haim and Cheryl Saban. The guest list for the August 22 event is said to include Disney CEO Bob Iger, outgoing DreamWorks Animation chief Jeffrey Katzenberg, superagent Casey Wasserman and producer Jon Vein. Saban and Wasserman supported Clinton in her 2008 primary battle against Barack Obama. But Katzenberg was one of Obama’s top Hollywood bundlers, raising more than $6 million for him between 2008 and 2012. Clinton has dominated her chief rival, Donald Trump, in Hollywood fundraising. The Democratic presidential nominee has raked in $17 million from the entertainment industry this cycle, according to the Center for Responsive Politics. Trump, who largely   his campaign through the Republican primary, has raised less than $200, 000 in Hollywood. The GOP nominee began hosting fundraisers in Los Angeles last month and counts the support of a small but influential group of Hollywood conservatives.   Follow Daniel Nussbaum on Twitter: @dznussbaum
