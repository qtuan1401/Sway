Deadpool and HBO’s Silicon Valley star T. J. Miller opened the 22nd annual Critics’ Choice Awards on Sunday by ribbing Donald Trump and the results of the 2016 presidential election. [“Before we start, we need to address the elephant in the room,” Miller told the   crowd at the Santa Monica Airport’s Barker Hangar in California. “It’s been in the news all weekend, and it’s really affected me: The election was definitely hacked by the Russians. ”  Miller’s gig hosting the annual awards show came just two days after the comedian was reportedly arrested in Hollywood for allegedly beating the driver of a car in which he was riding. TMZ reports Miller allegedly got into an argument with an Uber driver over Trump early Friday morning. The actor was cited on a misdemeanor offense and released. Later during Sunday’s show, Miller said it was “a big year for trolls. Not the movie, but dudes on the Internet. ” “One of them got elected,” he joked.  The Christmas Office Party star nagged audience members in the crowd and, at one point, pretended to shoot himself out of a cannon. The comic did seem to get serious for a moment, mounting an actual soapbox to scold celebrities who use award show acceptance speeches to preach politics. “All I want to do is talk about what’s going on in the world, but the problem is, I hate when celebrities get on their soap box,” Miller said. “Just do your act. Don’t tell the rest of us how to think, O. K.?” “Tonight is a celebration,” he informed the crowd. “Let’s all agree, and I agree, not to be upset until next year  …     in February   …     at the Oscars. ” As for the awards, La La Land, the critically acclaimed musical starring Ryan Gosling and Emma Stone, went home with some of the night’s biggest prizes, including best picture and best director. Natalie Portman won best actress for her portrayal of grieving First Lady Jacqueline Kennedy in the days after John F. Kennedy’s assassination in the Fox Searchlight biopic Jackie. HBO’s futuristic drama Westworld received two trophies, with Evan Rachel Wood winning best actress and Thandie Newton taking home best supporting actress. Donald Glover’s FX comedy drama about a budding rap star in Atlanta earned the   a best actor in a comedy prize. Though announced   Alec Baldwin was awarded guest performer in a comedy for his Saturday Night Live Trump impersonation.
