’  ’ ’   Don’t worry about Donald Trump  —   his Republican supporters have   been whispering to Never Trumpers like me for months. He doesn’t   really mean all of his campaign rhetoric. ’ ’   In fact, he doesn’t have much interest in policy at all, they   said. ’ ’   He’ll delegate governing to Mike Pence, Reince Priebus, and Paul   Ryan while he plays a lot of golf. You’ll see that there’s   nothing to be scared of. ’ ’   After just one week in office  —   arguably the worst opening since      premiered in 2002  —   Trump has exposed such assurances for what   they are: the kind of lies that supposedly smart people tell   themselves to feel better about a catastrophe they know in their   bones is looming. ’ ’   The president’s first seven days began on Jan. 20, when he   delivered the bleakest and most divisive  in U. S.   history, presenting a dystopian picture of the country as a land   of “carnage” that he blamed on America’s trade partners and   disloyal American elites. It sounded just like one of his   campaign rally speeches  —   not the kind of elevated addresses that   we have gotten used to from his predecessors, Democratic and   Republican alike. ’ ’   Seven days later, on Jan. 27, the first week concluded with the   release of an   decree temporarily barring our doors to   refugees from all over the world and passport holders from seven   Muslim countries selected seemingly at random. ’ ’   This   and badly implemented order caused chaos at U. S.   airports with border agents not knowing whom they were supposed   to admit and federal judges stepping in to prevent the   implementation of important parts of this draconian diktat until   their constitutionality can be litigated. ’ ’   The ostensible justification for this move was to protect us from   terrorists, but no terrorists from any of the seven banned Muslim   countries  —   Iraq, Syria, Iran, Sudan, Libya, Somalia, and Yemen  —     have ever killed anyone in America. ’ ’  ’ ’   It is hard to disagree with Benjamin Wittes’s  on the Lawfare blog   that Trump is “elevating the symbolic politics of bashing Islam   over any actual security interest. ” ’ ’   In between these lowlights, the nation was treated to risible   claims from the   president that the media had lied   about the size of his  and that he   would have won the popular vote were it not for the “millions” of   ballots cast illegally. ’ ’   To support the latter assertion, for which there is no actual   evidence, Trump alternatively cited a  relayed to   him by a friend of the German golfer Bernhard Langer (who is not   a U. S. citizen) and a  which no one has seen,   supposedly conducted by a conspiracy theorist named Gregg   Phillips. ’ ’   Phillips has also  that it was Barack   Obama’s Department of Homeland Security, not the Russian   intelligence services, that hacked the election and that “The UN   is global fascism. ” ’ ’  ’ ’      ’ ’   Middle East in greater danger. ’ ’  —   the Nazis’ primary   victims  —   with his spokesmen subsequently  that this was no   accidental oversight. ’ ’   Making good on his protectionist rhetoric, meanwhile, Trump   withdrew from the   Partnership, thus empowering   China and hurting the American economy, and then provoked a    with Mexico   by signing an executive order to start building a border wall   that he insists he will somehow make Mexico pay for. ’ ’   When the Mexican president, Enrique Peña Nieto, resolutely   refused to ante up, the White House threatened to impose a 20   percent tariff on Mexican goods, leading him to cancel a planned   summit. ’ ’   It is a mystery how America will benefit from aggravating   relations with our   trading partner and a vital ally   in the battle against drug trafficking and illegal migration  —     but Trump is clearly intent on provoking just such a crisis   because of the   animus he has long displayed.   (Remember his  about Judge   Gonzalo Curiel or his  about Mexican   “rapists” and “criminals” with which he launched his campaign?) ’ ’   The background music accompanying this horror show has been   Trump’s nonstop taunts of the “lying” news media, culminating in   this Sunday morning : “Somebody with aptitude   and conviction should buy the FAKE NEWS and failing and either   run it correctly or let it fold with dignity!” ’ ’  ’ ’   Vladimir Putin and Recep Tayyip Erdogan couldn’t have put it   better; this is exactly the strategy they have pursued to silence   press criticism. To make sure that no one missed the message,   Trump’s enforcer, Stephen Bannon,  the press to “keep its   mouth shut. ” ’ ’   There isn’t any new Trump, just as there was never a “new Nixon. ”   It’s the same old Trump that we saw all during the campaign and   indeed during his previous 69 years on this Earth: offensive,   divisive, prickly, bombastic, impetuous, conspiratorial, and   resistant to any evidence that contradicts his   idée fixe. ’ ’   And to the extent that anybody is calling the shots in this   presidency besides the president himself, it isn’t Vice President   Pence, Chief of Staff Priebus, or House Speaker Ryan. It’s   Bannon, the former publisher of Breitbart, a website that he has   proudly described as a “” for the racist,     and xenophobic “ . ” ’ ’   This is looking very much like the Bannon Regency. It was Bannon   and his sidekick Stephen Miller, a young former aide to      general nominee Jeff Sessions, who,   according to the Wall Street Journal,  Trump’s        inaugural address. ’ ’  ’ ’   And it was the two Steves who, according to  ran the rollout of the   immigration executive order on Friday afternoon, doing an end run   around the normal interagency process and overruling the   Department of Homeland Security to insist that the entry ban   apply to hundreds of thousands of permanent residents who   happened to hail from one of the seven banned Muslim countries. ’ ’  ’ ’  ’ ’   Imagine George W. Bush appointing Karl Rove to the principals   committee. Or Barack Obama appointing David Axelrod. It would   never have happened. And even if it had happened, it would have   been far less disquieting than appointing Bannon, because Rove   and Axelrod are far more mainstream figures than he is. ’ ’  ’ ’   White House Press Secretary Sean Spicer’s lame justification for   this shift was to  that Bannon deserves to be   on the NSC because he’s a “former naval officer. ” Yes, it’s    Bannon was a junior   naval officer more than 30 years ago, without ever seeing combat.   If that’s the standard to qualify for the nation’s most important   security committee, then there are literally millions of veterans   who are better qualified, having served more recently, seen more   action, or attained higher rank. ’ ’   One wonders how Secretary of Defense James Mattis and      Secretary of State Rex Tillerson feel about having a political   hack with extremist views elevated to be their equals. Just as   one wonders how Secretary of Homeland Security John Kelly feels   about having a hugely important immigration order issued without,   apparently, any consultation with him. ’ ’   If they don’t push back now  —   and strongly  —   threatening to quit   if necessary, they are tacitly accepting that they will be taking   orders from Bannon for the rest of the administration. ’ ’   As a Never Trumper, I sincerely wished that my fears about the   Trump presidency would prove unfounded and overblown. But if   anything I underestimated just how capriciously he would rule. ’ ’   If Trump continues the way he started, he will usher in   Democratic congressional majorities in 2018, leading to   impeachment proceedings, and a Democratic president in 2020  —     likely on the present trajectory to be Elizabeth Warren. But   there is an awful lot of damage that he can cause in the   meantime. And he’s just getting started. ’
