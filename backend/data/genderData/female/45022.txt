’  ’ ”   Gary Cohn, President Donald Trump’s trusted economic adviser,   started his career as a trader at Goldman Sachs and wound up   becoming the bank’s president. ” ’   So when Cohn on Friday said the bond market was taking a   ”  view of the economy,” it seemed like a startling   admission. ’ ”   Either Cohn spent so long in the   that he’s forgotten how   financial markets work, or he just said bond traders weren’t   buying in to the president’s plan to make America’s economy great   again. ” ”   First, here’s what’s going on in the markets: Immediately after   Trump’s election, bond yields began to rise.
