During Sunday’s “Cats Roundtable” on New York AM 970, Donald Trump campaign manager Kellyanne Conway talked about the Republican presidential nominee’s upcoming debate with Democratic nominee Hillary Clinton.  According to Conway, Trump is preparing “every day” for the debate. She also said he will be “respectful” towards Clinton during the debates. “Mr. Trump is really preparing for the debate every day,” Conway told host John Catsimatidis. “He is the most authentic person to run for president in a very long time, so, stylistically, that’s not going to change. ” “We know before we even enter the debate forum the odds are stacked against us,” she continued. “When Sec. Clinton delivers her response, he will be respectful. ” Follow Trent Baker on Twitter @MagnifiTrent
