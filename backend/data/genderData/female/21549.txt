Donald Trump thanked Hillary Clinton’s top aide Huma Abedin and her estranged husband, disgraced former lawmaker Anthony Weiner, during his campaign rally in Grand Rapids, Michigan. [Trump blasted the former secretary of state for the FBI investigation into her use of a private email server.  “As you know, the FBI has reopened its investigation into Hillary Clinton and discovered another 650, 000 emails,” Trump announced. “She lied under oath when she turned over all of her work related emails. Just one more lie out of so many. ” “She has brought all of this on herself,” the Republican nominee stated, alleging that “Hillary is the one who set up an illegal private email server in a closet to shield her criminal activity. Hillary is the one who engaged in a corrupt    scheme at the state department. ” “650, 000! You know what I call that? That’s the mother lode,” Trump said. “I think we hit the mother lode as they say in the good old mining industry. ” ”Thank you, Huma. Thank you, Huma. Good job, Huma. Thank you, Anthony Weiner.”  —   @realDonaldTrump on @HillaryClinton email investigation pic. twitter.   —   Fox News (@FoxNews) October 31, 2016,  “We can be sure that what is in those emails is absolutely devastating,” Trump suggested. “Thank you, Huma.
