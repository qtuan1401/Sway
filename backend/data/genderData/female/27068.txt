He brought you #IAMSORRY. He brought you a   of his heartbeat, and one of himself watching all 29 of his own movies. He invited you to “touch his soul,” and made you unafraid to be inspired. [Now, Shia LaBeouf invites you, again, to experience his latest performance art: being stuck in an elevator for 24 hours.  The    Transformers actor and performance artist debuted his latest piece, #ELEVATE, at the Oxford Union in England on Friday. LaBeouf and frequent collaborators Nastja Sade Rönkkö and Luke Turner will spend 24 hours in an elevator inside the building, pausing only for bathroom breaks and a   lecture the actor will deliver Friday evening at Oxford University. The #ELEVATE event is being   here: Reactions to the stunt were mixed on social media: I dont get this #ELEVATE thing. I am looking at an elevator door and listening to people talk. Someone explain the art in this.  —   Niko Coromelas (@NikoCoromelas) February 19, 2016,  #ELEVATE @thecampaignbook thanks for the chat pic. twitter.   —   Matthew Salzano (@matthew_paul) February 19, 2016,  I’m next to go into the elevator with Shia LeBouf.

They’re having surprisingly interesting conversations over there.  —   Victoria McNally (@vqnerdballs) February 19, 2016,  Shia is doing another live stream and yet again I am HOOKED! !!! #ELEVATE,  —   TPJ (@Ti_Lon) February 19, 2016,  The trio mostly just talked during the first part of the event, including about presidential politics: Shia does not like Harrison Ford, Donald Trump. Loves Bernie. “It would be great if he were President. ” #ELEVATE,  —   Daniel Dalton (@wordsbydan) February 19, 2016,  The actor is set to appear next in the film American Honey, due out later this year.
