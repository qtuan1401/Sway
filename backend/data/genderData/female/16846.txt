Mr Hookem said he thought the criticism of the new Prime Minster over her twitter response was “shallow” saying, “What we need is actions not words. ” “Mr Cameron may well have responded on twitter but what we really need is to have better border security and to raise the level of the alert. “But fundamentally what we are desperately in need of a strong border force with investment in people and technology. ” Update 1348 BST (0848 EST) Dr Sebastian Gorka and Oliver Lane were on Breitbart News Daily on Sirius XM this morning to talk about the Nice attack.
