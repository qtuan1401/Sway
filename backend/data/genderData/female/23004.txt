An exclusive video published by the Secure America Now shows an actor playing    nominated Hillary Clinton in a prison cell, piling onto the “Hillary For Prison” meme popular with both Donald Trump and Bernie Sanders supporters.  Viewers can see a 360 degree video of Clinton in a cell wearing orange. WATCH: “Hillary Clinton has committed numerous crimes: from lying to the American people about Benghazi to deliberately putting national security at risk by using her personal server for classified information. Hillary Clinton’s crimes should be putting her on the path to the jail house, not the White House,” Secure America captioned the video. The Democratic National Convention has lurched from disaster to disaster as Wikileaks dumped tens of thousands of private emails revealing, among other things, top Democrats conspired against Vermont Independent Sen. Bernie Sanders and dictated stories to mainstream media reporters. DNC chair Debbie Wasserman Schultz was forced to resign in disgrace Sunday  —   and was again forced to step down from gaveling the convention. She has since joined Clinton’s campaign in a move even   media figures have labeled as bad optics. Sanders supporters have chanted “lock her up!” in reference to Clinton. Readers can follow the Breitbart News Network’s livewire to watch the Democrats’ convention and   protests unfold.
