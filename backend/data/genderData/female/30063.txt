TEL AVIV  —   Actress and comedian Roseanne Barr excoriated President Obama on Twitter for abstaining from a UN Security Council vote that passed on Friday demanding a halt in Israeli construction in the West Bank and eastern Jerusalem and referring to those lands as “Palestinian territories. ” [Barr compared Obama’s abstention, which allowed the   resolution to pass, with “Nazis” who “enacted   laws on the eve of Jewish   as @POTUS has done on eve of Hanukkah. ”  She sent out the following tweets: nazis enacted anti jewish laws on the eve of jewish   as @POTUS has done on eve of Hanukkah.

If they light Hanukkah candles 2night=   —   Roseanne Barr (@therealroseanne) December 24, 2016,  Today is   I will say: Every Evil wished upon Israel and the Jewish Ppl is returned to its Source, cancelled and cleared.  —   Roseanne Barr (@therealroseanne) December 24, 2016,  Barr visited the Jewish state last March to keynote a Jerusalem conference exposing the   Boycott, Divestment and Sanctions (BDS) campaign. The text of the resolution repeatedly and wrongly refers to the West Bank and eastern sections of Jerusalem as “Palestinian territory occupied since 1967. ”  The Western Wall and Temple Mount plaza are located in eastern Jerusalem. In actuality, the Palestinians never had a state in either the West Bank or eastern Jerusalem and they are not legally recognized as the undisputed authority in those areas. Jordan occupied and annexed the West Bank and eastern Jerusalem from 1948 until Israel captured the lands in a defensive war in 1967 after Arab countries used the territories to launch attacks against the Jewish state.  In 1988 Jordan officially renounced its claims to the West Bank and eastern Jerusalem. The text of the resolution declares that the Israeli settlement enterprise has “no legal validity and constitutes a flagrant violation under international law and a major obstacle to the achievement of the   solution and a just, lasting and comprehensive peace. ” It calls for Israel to “immediately and completely cease all settlement activities in the occupied Palestinian territory, including East Jerusalem. ” As the Committee for Accuracy for Middle East Reporting in America (CAMERA) pointed out in an email blast, international law does not make Israeli settlements illegal. CAMERA notes: Article 49 of the Fourth Geneva Conventions, which is relied upon by those who claim the settlements are illegal, does not apply in the case of the West Bank. This is because the West Bank was never under   by a nation that was a party to the Convention, and therefore there is no “partial or total occupation of the territory of a High Contracting Party,” as Article 2 of the Convention specifies. Moreover, even if it did apply, by its plain terms, it applies only to forcible transfers and not to voluntary movement. Therefore, it can’t prohibit Jews from choosing to move to areas of great historical and religious significance to them. The resolution contradicts a Bush administration commitment to allowing some existing Jewish settlements to remain under a future   deal. That U. S. commitment, which the Obama administration has repeatedly violated by condemning settlement activity, was reportedly a key element in Israel’s decision to unilaterally evacuate the Gaza Strip in 2005. The UN draft resolution text states that “cessation of all Israeli settlement activities is essential for salvaging the   solution,” and it “calls for affirmative steps to be taken immediately to reverse the negative trends on the ground that are imperiling the   solution. ” In 2004, just prior to the Gaza evacuation, President Bush issued a declarative letter stating that it is unrealistic to expect that Israel will not retain some Jewish settlements in a   deal with the Palestinians. The letter stated: In light of new realities on the ground, including already existing major Israeli populations centers, it is unrealistic to expect that the outcome of final status negotiations will be a full and complete return to the armistice lines of 1949, and all previous efforts to negotiate a   solution have reached the same conclusion. It is realistic to expect that any final status agreement will only be achieved on the basis of mutually agreed changes that reflect these realities. Elliott Abrams, the Deputy National Security Adviser for Global Democracy Strategy during Bush’s second term, was instrumental in brokering understandings between the U. S. and Israel on settlements. In a June 2009 piece published by the Wall Street Journal, Abrams accused the Obama administration of “abandoning” those U. S.  understandings by taking positions critical of all settlement activity. Abrams wrote: There were indeed agreements between Israel and the United States regarding the growth of Israeli settlements on the West Bank   …     principles that would permit some continuing growth.   …     They emerged from discussions with American officials and were discussed by Messrs. Sharon and Bush at their Aqaba meeting in June 2003.   …     The prime minister of Israel relied on them in undertaking a wrenching political reorientation  —   the dissolution of his government, the removal of every single Israeli citizen, settlement and military position in Gaza, and the removal of four small settlements in the West Bank.   …     For reasons that remain unclear, the Obama administration has decided to abandon the understandings about settlements reached by the previous administration with the Israeli government. We may be abandoning the deal now, but we cannot rewrite history and make believe it did not exist. Aaron Klein is Breitbart’s Jerusalem bureau chief and senior investigative reporter.
