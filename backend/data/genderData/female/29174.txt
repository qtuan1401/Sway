PayPal   and billionaire Trump supporter Peter Thiel proclaimed at the National Press Club in Washington, D. C. on Monday that what Donald Trump represents is “not going away,” and that depending on the outcome of this upcoming election, “the only important question will be whether or not that new politics came too late. ”[“We have fallen very far from that standard,” proclaimed Thiel, after listing the previous accomplishments of government, including the Manhatten Project, the Interstate Highway System, and the Apollo Missions. “We cannot let free market ideology serve as an excuse for decline. ”   “No matter what happens in this election, what Trump represents isn’t crazy, and it’s not going away,” he continued. “He points toward a new Republican Party beyond the dogmas of Reaganism. ” “He points even beyond the remaking of one party, to a new American politics that overcomes denial, rejects bubble thinking, and reckons with reality,” Thiel concluded, adding, “When the distracting spectacles of this election season are forgotten, and the history of our time is written, the only important question will be whether or not that new politics came too late. ” Charlie Nash is a reporter for Breitbart Tech.
