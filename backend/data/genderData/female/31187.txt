Pollster and Democratic strategist Pat Caddell told Breitbart News Daily SiriusXM host Matt Boyle Tuesday that in the aftermath of the 2016 election, “The media does not have any confidence in the collective wisdom of the American people, and the people resent that. ”[Caddell pointed out that the media continue to portray Trump, his voters, and everything around him as “base. ”  “It’s appalling, actually,” he said, “and it’s not doing anything to heal the country. ” The media’s “willingness to say, ‘Oh, my gosh, we missed something’ lasted about   hours,” said Caddell. “And then it’s back to, ‘We know best. ’” Caddell said the media even relied on “crazy reasonings” to justify how they got things so wrong. “The problem with that,” said Caddell, “is that they have not taken stock on the change it represents or the legitimacy of the American people’s frustration with what’s happened in Washington with the political class and the media altogether. ” As for the Clinton email controversy, Caddell said he’s “not sure it’s a good idea” for   Trump to forgo appointing a special prosecutor to pursue possible charges against Hillary Clinton after he assumes office in January. “I think we’ve got a division here,” said Caddell, “on the one hand not looking like a banana republic, throwing our opponents in jail.   …     But on the other hand, the rule of law here has been terribly abused. ” He went on, “But I do think when you’ve got   of the American people who believe that there are two standards of justice, one for the rich and powerful like the Clintons and one for the rest of us, that that’s a problem. ” Caddell called the investigation under the Obama administration “one of the   investigations of all time. ” Breitbart News Daily airs on SiriusXM Patriot 125 weekdays from 6:00 a. m. to 9:00 a. m.
