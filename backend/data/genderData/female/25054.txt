On Tuesday’s broadcast of MSNBC’s “Morning Joe,” MSNBC’s “The Last Word” host Lawrence O’Donnell stated of the FBI’s report on its investigation of Democratic presidential nominee former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton’s emails, “Cheryl Mills is one of the principals, investigators would call her a suspect at that point. What is she doing in the interview with Hillary Clinton?   …     That was really peculiar, really strange.  O’Donnell said, “[T]here’s one really striking thing in it, just procedurally, which is, Cheryl Mills being in the interview with Hillary Clinton. Cheryl Mills is one of the principals, investigators would call her a suspect at that point. What is she doing in the interview with Hillary Clinton? And the claim is, she’s in here as Hillary Clinton’s lawyer, one of many, in the room with Hillary Clinton. That was really peculiar, really strange. Then again, this is not the prosecutorial stage. This is the FBI stage, and truly, we have never seen how this procedure works. ” He then stated that the Clinton campaign would respond, “Someone who you can say has used bad judgment, in relation to the electronic portion of being secretary of state, but committed no crimes, is being discussed about  —   discussed ad nauseam, while Donald Trump gave $25, 000, illegally, to the attorney general of Florida [Pam Bondi (R)] in a coincidental set of timing, that raises the question of, was that a reward for the attorney general of Florida not going forward with an investigation of Trump University, as the attorney general of New York [Eric Schneiderman (D)] did?” O’Donnell continued that the Clinton email story is “essentially about judgement. And it is about  —   it’s also about personnel judgement. ” He later added, “[C]ompare it to Trump, and the Florida attorney general, that isn’t staff. That’s Donald Trump. That’s his decision. ” Follow Ian Hanchett on Twitter @IanHanchett
