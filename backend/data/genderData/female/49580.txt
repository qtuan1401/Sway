’  ’ ”   Billionaire businessman Mark Cuban provided an apt analogy for     Donald Trump on Wednesday: an NBA team’s top   draft pick. ” ’   Cuban, the owner of the NBA’’s Dallas Mavericks and star of ABC’’s   ”Shark Tank” took questions from CNBC after his testimony in   front of a congressional subcommittee regarding the Time    &T merger. ’ ’   Naturally, he was asked about the   whom he    as he became a prominent surrogate for Democratic   presidential nominee Hillary Clinton. ’ ’   Cuban, who recently wrote that he was  not to vote for Trump, told CNBC that ”Donald Trump is   our No. 1 draft pick.” Cuban was asked about how business   executives should view Trump’’s deal to  in Indiana and   his . ’ ’   ”I’’ll analogize it to the NBA draft: He’’s the No. 1 pick,” Cuban   said. ”He’’s who we put our hopes and dreams with, and we’’re going   to believe in him. Right now it’’s a little bit easier because we   haven’’t played a game yet.” ’ ’   ”There’’s no reason to rush to judgment or come to any conclusions   now,” he continued. ”Let’’s see what happens starting January 21   and go from there. I hope he’’s a superstar, and I hope everything   turns out the way we all hope it will. But until January 21,   there’’s no real point at going into detail.” ’ ”   Cuban was also asked about his meeting last month with Steve   Bannon, Trump’s controversial incoming White House chief   strategist. ” ’   ”That’’s not a topic for now,” Cuban said. When pressed further,   he said they discussed ”coffee.” ’ ’ ’ ’Mark Cuban, asked about photo of him & Steve Bannon having coffee together, laughs and then veers off into another topic ’
