Washington (CNN) A Capitol Police officer who risked his life responding to Wednesday’s attack on a Republican baseball practice threw the first pitch at the Congressional Baseball Game Thursday. Major League Baseball executive Joe Torre presented the game ball to special agent David J. Bailey, who walked onto the field on crutches to loud applause before throwing the first pitch    while putting most of his weight on his left foot.  Although he did not suffer a gunshot wound, Capitol Police said Wednesday that Bailey was treated for a minor injury.  The other Capitol Police agent who was on site yesterday when shots were fired, Crystal Griner, was shot in in the ankle and remained hospitalized Thursday. The ball was taken to the hospital and signed by Matt Mika, a lobbyist and former congressional staffer who was shot during Wednesday’s shooting, a friend of Mika’s wrote on Twitter. Bailey’s appearance came as a surprise    British Ambassador Nigel Kim Darroch was originally scheduled to throw the first pitch.  President Donald Trump praised Bailey and Griner in a video message that played before the start of the game. ”We also pray special agents Crystal Griner and David Bailey of the Capitol Police for their heroic deeds that saved so many lives. What a great job they did,” Trump said.
