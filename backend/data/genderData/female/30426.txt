Commenting on Donald Trump’s choice for his future Secretary of Defense, General Mattis, MILO said that he makes famously macho actor Clinton Eastwood “look like a Thai ladyboy. ”[  He was reacting to the news that Trump had chosen General James Mattis, a decorated former Marine Corps general, as his Secretary of Defense early this week. “Look at Trump’s new Secretary of Defense, General “Mad Dog” Mattis. This guy is so   he makes Clint Eastwood look like a Thai ladyboy. He might as well double up as Secretary of the Patriarchy,” he said. “Mad Dog Mattis understands that national defense, like gender, is a binary.  Friend or foe. Success or failure, or, as the Marines would say, victor or vanquished,” he continued.  However Mattis only retired from the military in 2013, meaning his candidacy will require the waiver of the National Security Act of 1947 that requires a seven year waiting period in order to enter a political position following a career military service. Milo concluded his talk at Ohio University by sharing a quote of Mattis’s, which he described as “the most patriarchal quote of my life. ” “You go into Afghanistan, you got guys who slap women around for five years because they didn’t wear a veil. You know, guys like that ain’t got no manhood left anyway. So it’s a hell of a lot of fun to shoot them. Actually it’s quite fun to fight them, you know. It’s a hell of a hoot. It’s fun to shoot some people. I’ll be right up there with you. I like brawling. ” General James Mattis, Written from prepared remarks. Watch MILO’s full talk below.
