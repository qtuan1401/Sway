Musician and actor John Legend says he is “worried” about the status of Planned Parenthood in the coming Donald Trump administration. [Legend says the abortion chain is “trying to protect the people from an oppressive government and from people that would want to take their rights away. ”  While a guest on The Daily Show with Trevor Noah, Legend discussed his organization Free America, which focuses on the criminal justice system through the lens of “mass incarceration and the    pipeline” and the deaths of “unarmed young men and women of color. ” “I think there’s a lot of places, depends on what you’re  —   you’re  —   you’re worried about and what’s important to you,” Legend said, “but I  —   I think, in a Trump administration, we should worry about places like Planned Parenthood. We should worry about places like the ACLU. We should worry about organizations that are out there to protect people, the Legal Defense Fund for the NAACP. ” NewsBusters notes that Legend and his wife, Chrissy Teigen, are donors to Planned Parenthood. “All these places that are out there trying to protect the people from an oppressive government and from people that would want to take their rights away,” he added. “And so we all need to be involved and be vigilant and pay attention to what the government is doing under our name and with our money and hold them accountable and support organizations that are fighting the power. ” Planned Parenthood receives more than a   taxpayer dollars annually and has been under congressional investigation for a year for allegations that it sells the body parts of babies aborted in its clinics for a profit.
