New York’s primary allows only voters who are registered as a Republican or Democrat to vote in that party’s primary, and changes to party enrollment had to be completed by October. “That’s a good question,” Mr. Sanders replied, pausing his stride to speak to the man, Mike Cantalupo, a    Massapequa resident. “Are you eligible?” When Mr. Cantalupo said he is a registered independent, Mr. Sanders raised his eyebrows and placed his hand on the man’s shoulder: “Oh, here it is.
