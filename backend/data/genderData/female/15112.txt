Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu signaled his support for President Donald Trump’s wall on the Southern border of the United States.  “President Trump is right. I built a wall along Israel’s southern border. It stopped all illegal immigration,” Netanyahu wrote on Twitter. “Great success. Great idea. ” Earlier this week, Trump used the Israeli wall as an example of why he wanted to build a similar wall for the US. “A wall protects. All you have to do is ask Israel,” Trump said during an interview with Sean Hannity this week. “They were having a total disaster coming across, and they had a wall. It’s 99. 9 percent stoppage. ” Trump signed an executive order on Wednesday, ordering the construction of the wall that he vowed to build during his presidential campaign.
