The White House feigned ignorance about President Barack Obama’s speech “glitch” in Elkhart, Indiana last week when he was trying to attack Donald Trump but appeared to lose his train of thought.[  “I didn’t see any of those accounts,” Earnest said, in response to a question from Breitbart News about the exchange during the White House press briefing on Monday. The clip was highlighted by Breitbart News and covered on The Fox News program The Five. A Youtube clip of the report by Jim Hoft was featured directly on the Drudge Report. That video now has 2. 2 million views.
