(Want to get this briefing by email? Here’s the  .) Good evening. Here’s the latest. _____ 1. President Trump shifted to a tougher stance on Syria and its president. He called the chemical weapons attack on Tuesday “an affront to humanity” during a press conference with King Abdullah of Jordan at the White House. The death toll is believed to be over 100. At the United Nations, Ambassador Nikki Haley blamed Russia for blocking a Security Council response and warned that the U. S. might take unilateral action. The Daily podcast tracks the course of the Syrian conflict and the choices Mr. Trump faces. _____ 2. Mr. Trump removed Stephen Bannon, his chief strategist, from the National Security Council. The shift was orchestrated by the president’s national security adviser, Lt. Gen. H. R. McMaster. The new administration is giving the military far more leeway  —   allowing speedier decisions on raids, airstrikes, bombing missions and arming allies  —   but also making clear the buck stops with the generals if things go wrong. _____ 3. During an interview in the Oval Office, Mr. Trump suggested without evidence that Susan Rice, former President Barack Obama’s national security adviser, had committed a crime by seeking the identities of Americans swept up in U. S. surveillance of foreign officials. They turned out to be Trump associates. Mr. Trump criticized media outlets for failing to adequately cover the Rice controversy  —   while praising Fox News and the host Bill O’Reilly, the focus of an advertiser revolt over accusations of sexual harassment. “He is a good person,” he said. On Twitter, a hashtag about the allegations morphed into a way for women to share their stories about sexual harassment in the workplace. _____ 4. Mr. Trump is heading to Florida for a   meeting with President Xi Jinping of China at   . Their contrasting styles  —   scripted decorum versus brash unpredictability  —   could complicate their efforts to navigate clashing priorities on trade and North Korea. (But Ivanka Trump is playing remarkably well in China.) With calculated timing, North Korea fired an   ballistic missile into waters off its east coast. _____ 5. The fight over Mr. Trump’s nominee for the Supreme Court is about to go nuclear. Democratic senators say they will filibuster  —   refuse to close discussions  —   on Thursday. The Republicans counter that they’ll invoke “the nuclear option” to prevent filibusters on Supreme Court nominations, changing Senate rules to allow a simple majority to approve Judge Neil Gorsuch. Many senators in both parties now worry that the final and biggest domino  —   the power to filibuster legislation  —   will be next. _____ 6. Drugs go north, money and guns go south. We took a look at the flood of narcotrafficking revenue that goes back to Mexico from the U. S. The money has made the drug cartels powerful  —   but American officials say they don’t have the manpower to stop it. And in Washington, Homeland Security Secretary John Kelly said it is doubtful that a barrier spanning the whole southern border will be built. _____ 7. All the carbon dioxide we’ve been putting into the atmosphere has been doing something interesting to plants. In Antarctica, they’ve been growing far more quickly than at any other time in the past 54, 000 years. And a group of experts says it’s time to think about science fiction in the effort to slow down global warming. _____ 8. Pepsi pulled a controversial ad starring Kendall Jenner, with music by Skip Marley, that borrowed imagery from the Black Lives Matter movement. In the ad, Ms. Jenner gives a can of Pepsi to a police officer during a protest, provoking wild cheers from the crowd. Critics called it   and trivializing. “If only Daddy would have known about the power of #Pepsi,” tweeted Bernice King, daughter of Martin Luther King Jr. _____ 9. We admit it  —   we just loved the picture. Owls have always been objects of fascination, and now a new book looks at the elusiveness, diversity, beauty and ecological importance of these nocturnal birds of prey. They’ve been seen as death omens, symbols of wisdom and good fortune, portents of witchcraft or Harry Potter references. _____ 10. Finally, what’s the most effective   strategy for happiness? One expert says it’s to actively cultivate   which he defines as a sense of contentment in the knowledge that your life is flourishing and has meaning beyond your own pleasure. He suggests four exercises to help you get started. For a   lift, have a laugh with our latest roundup of the   comics. Have a great night. _____ Photographs may appear out of order for some readers.
