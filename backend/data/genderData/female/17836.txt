Mick Jagger, the legendary front man for the Rolling Stones, hinted Wednesday that he might perform at Donald Trump’s inauguration, after Trump closed out his victory speech with the song: “You Can’t Always Get What You Want. ”[Just was watching the news  …     maybe they’ll ask me to sing ‘You Can’t Always Get What You Want’ at the inauguration, ha!  —   Mick Jagger (@MickJagger) November 9, 2016,   The song was also played after Trump’s acceptance speech at the Republican National Convention in Cleveland in July, and after every other Trump speech at campaign rallies across the nation. The chorus became a subliminal message arguing for Trump’s candidacy: he may not be ideal, but he’s the only one: You can’t always get what you wantYou can’t always get what you wantYou can’t always get what you wantBut if you try sometimes you just might findYou get what you need, Trump’s rallies also featured other Rolling Stones songs, as well. One of the most memorable is “Tell Me,” a song about longing and return that begins with a small acoustic riff. It played at rallies while supporters waited for speakers to begin. Other artists featured in Trump’s touring playlist were a live version of Elton John’s “Funeral for a Friend (Love Lies Bleeding),” and the Backstreet Boys’ “I Want It That Way. ” At hangar rallies, when Trump’s airplane arrived, music played the theme to Air Force One  —   an uplifting song that also played during Trump’s introduction at the victory party at the New York Midtown Hilton on Election Night. And at other rallies, Trump came onstage to Lee Greenwood’s “God Bless the U. S. A. ” But “You Can’t Always Get What You Want” holds pride of place. Joel B. Pollak is Senior    at Breitbart News.
