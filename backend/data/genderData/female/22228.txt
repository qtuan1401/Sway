DES MOINES, Iowa  —   Donald Trump commented on the death of NBA star Dwyane Wade’s cousin, who was recently shot and killed, during his speech to roughly   supporters at Sen. Joni Ernst’s second annual Roast and Ride on Saturday. [“More than 6, 000   are the victims of murder every year,” the Republican nominee stated. “Just yesterday, the cousin of NBA star Dwyane Wade was the victim of a tragic shooting in Chicago. She was the mother of four, and was killed while pushing her infant child in a stroller. ”  “It breaks our hearts,” he added. “This shouldn’t happen in America. We send our thoughts and our prayers to the family, and we also promise to fight for a better tomorrow. ” The New Yorker noted that more than 2, 700 people have been shot in Chicago this year. “We cannot, as a society, tolerate this level of violence and suffering in our own cities,” he declared. “Those who would deny that this is a national crisis  —   a crisis requiring urgent action  —   have no business running for elected office. ” Trump also spoke about the poverty and unemployment facing Black Americans. He blamed “failed Democratic policies”  —   which he says are “the policies of Hillary Clinton”  —   for creating this poverty and crime.
