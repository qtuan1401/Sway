Presumptive Republican nominee Donald Trump took to Twitter to blast the New York Times for a story published on Saturday titled, “Crossing the Line: How Donald Trump Behaved With Women in Private. ”[That was an amazing interview on @foxandfriends  —   I hope the rest of the media picks it up to show how totally dishonest the @nytimes is!  —   Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) May 16, 2016,   The @nytimes is so dishonest. Their hit piece cover story on me yesterday was just blown up by Rowanne Brewer, who said it was a lie!  —   Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) May 16, 2016,  Trump also tweeted, “Wow, Rowanne Brewer, the most prominently depicted woman in the failing @nytimes story yesterday, was on @foxandfriends saying Times lied. ” Why did the failing @nytimes refuse to use any of the names given to them that I was so proud to have helped with their careers. DISHONEST!  —   Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) May 15, 2016,  Wow, I have had so many calls from high ranking people laughing at the stupidity of the failing @nytimes piece. Massive front page for that!  —   Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) May 15, 2016,  Why doesn’t the failing @nytimes write the real story on the Clintons and women? The media is TOTALLY dishonest!  —   Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) May 15, 2016,  Everyone is laughing at the @nytimes for the lame hit piece they did on me and women. I gave them many names of women I   to use,  —   Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) May 15, 2016,  The failing @nytimes wrote yet another hit piece on me. All are impressed with how nicely I have treated women, they found nothing. A joke!  —   Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) May 15, 2016,  The New York Times’ story claims to reveal Trump’s “unwanted romantic advances” on women decades ago, but the first woman cited in the article, Rowanne Brewer Lane, took to Fox News on Monday morning to debunk The Times‘ account, saying the paper painted the story in a negative light, twisting her quotes to make Trump look bad. The Times’ reported: The New York Times interviewed dozens of women who had worked with or for Mr. Trump over the past four decades, in the worlds of real estate, modeling and pageants women who had dated him or interacted with him socially and women and men who had closely observed his conduct since his adolescence. In all, more than 50 interviews were conducted over the course of six weeks. Their accounts  —   many relayed here in their own words  —   reveal unwelcome romantic advances, unending commentary on the female form, a shrewd reliance on ambitious women, and unsettling workplace conduct, according to the interviews, as well as court records and written recollections. Brewer Lane was disappointed in the way The Times portrayed her interview and spoke out, saying, “I was not happy to read it at all. ” Appearing on Fox and Friends Monday morning, Brewer Lane said, “Well, because The New York Times told us several times that they would make sure that my story that I was telling came across. They promised several times that they would do it accurately. They told me several times and my manager several times that it would not be a hit piece and that my story would come across the way that I was telling it and honestly, and it absolutely was not. ” “They spun it to where it appeared negative. I did not have a negative experience with Donald Trump, and I don’t appreciate them making it look like that I was saying that it was a negative experience because it was not,” Brewer Lane explained, saying she never felt demeaned by Trump.
