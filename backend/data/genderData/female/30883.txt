Morning Consult released its latest national poll Friday, and the news is all good for Donald Trump, whose support jumped from 38% last week to 44% support today. That puts The Donald a full +27 points ahead of second place Ted Cruz, who enjoys 17% support, which is exactly where he sat last week.  Ben Carson and Marco Rubio are tied for 3rd place at 10%. Carson jumped just +1 point since last week. Rubio, however, lost   points  —   a third of his support. Jeb Bush jumped from 6% to 8%. John Kasich doubled his support from 2% to 4%. The Real Clear Politics poll of national polls does not show anything this dramatic. Trump is in first place over Cruz but only by +9 points. It is worth noting, though, that the newest national poll in this average is more than a week old.   Follow John Nolte on Twitter @NolteNC
