On Wednesday’s broadcast of the Fox News Channel’s “Special Report,” columnist Charles Krauthammer argued   Donald Trump should pick former Massachusetts Governor Mitt Romney to be Secretary of State if he thinks Romney is best for the job, and “we’re going to learn a lot from Trump by what he does on this appointment. ”  Krauthammer said [relevant remarks begin around 7:00] that it was “encouraging” Trump didn’t seem to be going with the advice of former Arkansas Governor Mike Huckabee that Romney should renounce his criticisms of Trump before he was considered for a position, because Trump’s job is “to put together a successful presidency, to vindicate all the people who support him, and to show that he can do what he said he would do. If it turns out that Mitt Romney is the best for that job, given the other candidates that we’ve heard about, he’s certainly somebody you might want, he should pick him, and show that he can overcome the previous animosity. So, I think we’re going to learn a lot from Trump by what he does on this appointment. ” Follow Ian Hanchett on Twitter @IanHanchett
