The Philadelphia Fraternal Order of Police president John McNesby is criticizing Hillary Clinton for not seeking his organization’s endorsement.  “They didn’t care. Their attitude, then, back in July, during the DNC, was they were going to win this thing anyway, so who cares? Now, I think the tides have turned a little bit and she’s on her heels,” McNesby told Talk Radio 1210 WPHT, discussing his organizations endorsement. “As many times as we’ve tried to  …    have it a fair process and an open process, the emails back were that they’re not interested and no thanks. Just snide things like that. ” The National Fraternal Order of Police endorsed Trump last week. McNesby continued: We’re falling in line with the national FOP and, basically, she just disregarded and blew the police off. You can’t go in and expect to get respect when you didn’t give it to us. We gave a very fair process, we thought. We put out a questionnaire and she absolutely refused  …    outright refused, with a nasty campaign rebuttal to why she wouldn’t. Simple as that, we went in and we participated with the candidate that cooperated. He filled it out. We met with him.
