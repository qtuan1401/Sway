An ad created by the super PAC supporting John Kasich has adopted Donald Trump’s nickname for rival Sen. Ted Cruz: “Lyin’ Ted. ”[New Day Independent Media Committee’s video ad begins, “Many just call him Lyin’ Ted,” as a narrator proceeds to list Cruz’s alleged “lies. ”   “Lied about Ben Carson to steal a win in Iowa lied about being the best for the GOP when polls show he can’t even beat Hillary Clinton his TV ad about John Kasich lied. Stations had to pull it off the air. ” “If Ted Cruz’s mouth is moving, he’s lying,” the ad continues. The ad is released as Trusted Leadership PAC  —   which backs Cruz  —   unveiled this week a $500, 000 ad buy in Wisconsin that slams Kasich, reports Politico. The   ad  —   called Kasich Won’t Play  —   hits the Ohio governor for his accepting super PAC donations from leftwing billionaire George Soros, and his expansion of Medicaid under Obamacare in his state, and his hikes in taxes.  “Given John Kasich’s liberal record, it’s no surprise his campaign isn’t rebounding, because John Kasich won’t play in Wisconsin,” the ad’s narrator says. “Team Kasich is not telling the truth,” said Chip Roy, executive director of Trusted Leadership. “The Trusted Leadership PAC ad was not pulled from television stations. It was slightly modified on a technical issue out of an abundance of caution. John Kasich’s team would rather hammer on a minor technical issue than talk about his liberal record. ” Kasich campaign manager John Weaver tweeted the following on the Lyin’ Ted ad: Lyin’ Ted, on every level. 0 Friends: tells story. 0 Record: tells history. 0 Vision: tells future. 0 chance: tells desperation. #cruzloser,  —   John Weaver (@JWGOP) March 29, 2016,
