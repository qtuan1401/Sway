Gen. Jerry Boykin, executive vice president of the Family Research Council, discussed the 2016 Values Voter Summit, which takes place September 9  —   11 in Washington, D. C. with Breitbart News Daily SiriusXM host Alex Marlow, saying, “What I think we’re going to see here this weekend is a lot more people become comfortable with the   ticket. ”[Added Boykin:  If you notice what Donald Trump has been doing recently, stayed on message, he has followed a lot of good advice from the people around him.   …     So I think we’re going to have a lot of people coming in still questioning whether they’re going to support Trump, and I think it’s going to be an opportunity for them to be convinced that the guy will make a much better president than Hillary. There just are no perfect candidates. More on the Values Voter Summit is here: Values Voter Summit was created in 2006 to provide a forum to help inform and mobilize citizens across America to preserve the bedrock values of traditional marriage, religious liberty, sanctity of life and limited government that make our nation strong.
