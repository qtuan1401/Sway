’  ’ ”   Stephen Curry made arguably his strongest political statements to   date on Wednesday when he mocked both President Donald Trump and   Under Armour CEO Kevin Plank’s praise of Trump. ” ’   Plank was highly complimentary of Trump in an interview on   Tuesday with” saying ”to have such a     president is something that is a real asset for the   country.” ’ ”   That didn’t seem to sit well with Curry, one of Under Armour’s   top athletes.  Curry responded to the comments. ” ’   ”I agree with that description,” Curry said, ”if you remove the   ’’et’’ from asset.” ’ ’   Curry told The Mercury News that he spent most of Tuesday on the   phone with Plank and others at Under Armour. Plank explained to   Curry, according to Thompson, that the comments on Trump were   meant ”exclusively from a business perspective.” ’ ’’ ”   Curry went on to explain that Plank’s involvement as part of a   collaboration with Trump and other business leaders won’t cause   Curry to leave the brand. Rather, he wants to make sure Under   Armour doesn’t adopt Trump’s values. ” ’   ”It’s a fine line but it’s about how we’re operating,” Curry   said, ”How inclusive we are, what we stand for. He’s the   President. There are going to be people that are tied to them.   But are we promoting change? Are we doing things that   are going to look out for everybody? And not being so     that it’s only about making money, selling shoes,   doing this and that. That’s not the priority. It’s about changing   lives. I think we can continue to do that.” ’ ’.  ’ ’Stephen Curry made arguably his strongest. ..’
