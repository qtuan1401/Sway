Friday on MSNBC’s “All In,” Slate columnist Michelle Goldberg weighed in on   Donald Trump’s victory tour thanking his voters, saying the rallies are “menacing and threatening” the majority of the people who did not vote for him in the 2016 election,  “The whole posture is one of both rallying the people who voted for him, and also kind of menacing and threatening the majority who didn’t  —   with these sort of menacing asides. ‘They’re on our side, they just don’t know it yet.’ ‘You’re going to like what we have in store.’ I don’t think I am reading too much into this,” Goldberg told host Chris Hayes. She concluded that Trump will “turn our country into a racist police state. ” (  RCP Video) Follow Trent Baker on Twitter @MagnifiTrent
