Singer Lada Gaga hopped on a sanitation truck early Wednesday morning in protest of   Donald Trump’s unprecedented victory Tuesday night to become America’s 45th president. [The diehard Hillary Clinton supporter, who had campaigned alongside the Democratic candidate just hours before the polls opened Tuesday night, shared a photo of herself holding up a “Love Trumps Hate” sign while standing on a sanitation truck outside of Trump Tower in New York City.  “I want to live in a #CountryOfKindness where #LoveTrumpsHate,” the “Bad Romance” singer said in a message to her 64 million Twitter followers. ❤️🇺🇸I want to live in a #CountryOfKindness where #LoveTrumpsHate pic. twitter.   —   #CountryOfKindness (@ladygaga) November 9, 2016,  The singer had performed in front of thousands at a midnight rally in Raleigh, North Carolina for Clinton’s final campaign event Monday night. “I could never have fathomed that I would experience, in my lifetime, that a woman would become president of the United States,” Gaga said to thunderous applause from the audience. As Clinton’s defeat slowly became clear, Gaga shared a photo of herself standing alongside prominent Black Lives Matter activist DeRay Mckesson. “In a room full of hope, we will be heard. @deray#blacklivesmatter Stand up for kindness, equality, and love. Nothing will stop us,” she wrote.
