[Cyrus has been vocal about her support for Hillary Clinton, and even campaigned for her in Virginia on Saturday.  During a conversation with a student, Cyrus complained that the 2016 presidential election had become “super hateful. ” “When I go through my Instagram comments, when I post in support for Hillary, I can’t believe some of the hate that I get,” she said, admitting that her “socials” helped her communicate with people around the country.  She urged young supporters to vote, and to bring their friends to vote in the election. “Love trumps hate,” she said before leaving the student’s room.
