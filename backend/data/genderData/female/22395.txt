Wednesday on MSNBC, actor and director Rob Reiner said Republican presidential nominee Donald Trump was “the single most unqualified person ever to run for president in my lifetime. ”  Reiner said  “Well, yes. We talk about somebody coming from a reality show. Running for president is not a reality show. It’s actual reality. And this man is the single most unqualified person ever to run for president in my lifetime. I mean, just to hear what you just said, we had an entire presidency taken down in the ’70s over Watergate, and that was a   to the national Democratic headquarters that didn’t amount to anything because they didn’t get anything. Here we have a   to the Democratic national headquarters where everything is stolen, and there’s a conceivable connection to the Trump campaign. That to me is just    insane. I can’t even believe we’re having this conversation here. I mean, this is    crazy. We’re in crazy land here. ” Follow Pam Key on Twitter @pamkeyNEN
