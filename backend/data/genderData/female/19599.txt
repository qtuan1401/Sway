Democratic presidential nominee Hillary Clinton said that the Islamic State was praying to Allah that Donald Trump would be the next President of the United States. [“They are saying, ‘Oh please, Allah, make Trump president of America,’” Clinton said in an interview with Israel’s Channel 2 News.   Clinton argued that Trump was helping the terrorists by describing their efforts as “radical Islamic terrorism,” something with which she disagreed. “We have come to understand that bringing Islam into the definition of our enemy actually serves the purpose of the radical jihadists and there is a lot of evidence of that,” she said. In a later news conference, Clinton doubled down on her accusations, citing an article by former Director of the National Counterterrorism Center Matt Olsen. “They hope that Allah delivers America to Trump,” she said, saying that Trump’s election would inspire more jihadi attacks. She called Trump’s proposed ban on Muslims coming to America and his insults of the Khan family “a gift to ISIS. ”
