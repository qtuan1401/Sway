’  ’ ’   The ABC sitcom ” ” came out with one of the more explicit   commentaries of any scripted show on the election of Donald Trump   with its episode Wednesday night, ”Lemon.” And critics are piling   on praise for it. ’ ”   The   show, which has previously addressed Black   Lives Matter and police violence, used the character Dre’s   workplace to talk about the presidential election. All of Dre’s   coworkers except for one voted for Hillary Clinton. When pressed   for an explanation, that Trump voter, Lucy, comes off as   reasonable: ” ’  ’ ’  ’ ’     “I love this country even though at times it doesn’t love me     back. For my whole life my parents, my grandparents, me, for     most black people, this system has never worked for us. But we     still play ball, tried to do our best to live by the rules even     though we knew they would never work out in our favor, had to     live in neighborhoods that you wouldn’t drive through, send our     kids to schools with books so beat up you couldn’t read them,     work jobs that you wouldn’t consider in your nightmares.   ’ ’     ”Black people wake up every day believing our lives are gonna     change even though everything around us says it’s not. Truth be     told, you ask most black people and they tell you no matter who     won the election, they don’t expect the hood to get better. But     they still voted because that’s what you’re supposed to do.   ’ ’     ”You think I’m not sad that Hillary didn’t win? That I’m not     terrified about what Trump’s about to do? I’m used to things     not going my way. I’m sorry that you’re not and it’s blowing     your mind, so excuse me if I get a little offended because I     didn’t see all of this outrage when everything was happening to     all of my people since we were stuffed on boats in chains. I     love this country as much  —   if not more  —   than you do. And     don’t you ever forget that. ”   ’ ”   Anderson’s Andre walks out of the conference room on the show,   but he adds a hopeful note in a voiceover: ” ’  ’ ”   A lot of viewers and critics were quick to call it a phenomenal   episode for the show, and a moment that sums up many Americans’   feelings after the election. ” ’ ’ ” ’t’t’t🙌🏾 ’s ’Blackish’ monologue on Trump is the definition of   TV   ” ” ’t’t’tI know there will end up being a backlash to the backlash of the backlash’s backlash for tonight’s Blackish but that episode was terrific. ’t’t” ’ ’t’t’tHand Anthony Anderson an Emmy by midnight!
