’  ’ ’   Prominent Democrats on Tuesday suggested that Donald Trump   leveled an ”assassination threat” aimed at Hillary Clinton during   his Tuesday rally in North Carolina. ’ ’  ’ ’   He added: ”This isn’’t play. Unstable people with powerful guns   and an unhinged hatred for Hillary are listening to you.” ’ ’  ’ ’   ”If she gets to pick her judges, nothing you can do, folks.   Although the Second Amendment people  —   maybe there is. I don’’t   know,” Trump said. ’ ’’ ’   ”Speaking to the NRA folks  —   who are great,”   he continued. ”If you don’’t do the right thing, you’’re   not going to have a Second Amendment, or you’’re not going to have   much of it left.” ’ ’   The comment faced immediate backlash, as many accused Trump   of suggesting that   advocates should use some kind   of force to stop Clinton from appointing Supreme Court justices   that disagree with their views on the issue. ’ ’   Both Trump’’s and Clinton’’s campaigns released statements on the   matter shortly afterward. Trump’’s campaign attributed the   controversy to ”dishonest media,” while the Clinton   campaign condemned the idea of violence in American   politics. ’ ”   In addition to Murphy, Sen. Elizabeth Warren of Massachusetts,   former 2016 presidential candidate Martin O’Malley, and Rep. Eric   Swalwell of California, among others, condemned Trump’s remarks. ” ’  ’ ’  ’ ’  ’ ’   ”If you ever wondered what was at stake this November,   @realdonaldtrump’’s hint at assassination shows you what kind of   person he is,” . ’ ’  ’ ’   ”Donald Trump suggested someone kill Sec. Clinton,” . ”We must take people at their word.” ’
