Presumptive Republican nominee Donald Trump’s communications advisor Michael Caputo posted on Twitter, appearing to celebrate the news that campaign manager Corey Lewandowski had been fired  —   but now Caputo is out too. [Ding dong the witch is dead! https:  .  pic. twitter.   —   Michael Caputo (@MichaelRCaputo) June 20, 2016,   Later on Monday, Caputo resigned in a statement to Paul Manafort, who has replaced Lewandowski as campaign manager, according to CNN. I regret sending out a tweet today alluding to the firing of Corey Lewandowski. In hindsight, that was too exuberant a reaction to this personnel move. I know this is a distraction from the kind of campaign you want to run, so I’m resigning my position as director of communications for caucus operations at the 2016 Republican Convention. Let’s make this immediate. Earlier in the morning on Monday, the Trump campaign announced Lewandowski was parting ways with the campaign.
