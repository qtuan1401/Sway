Sunday on NBC’s “Meet the Press,” Democratic presidential   Hillary Clinton said presumptive Republican presidential nominee Donald Trump’s candidacy “poses immediate dangers” to America.  Partial transcript as follows: CLINTON: I think what’s important is we’re not going to let, at least my campaign, is not going to let Donald Trump try to normalize himself in this period between. TODD: You think a competitive Democratic primary is doing nothing but helping Donald Trump right now? CLINTON: I didn’t say that. I said if we don’t respond to Donald Trump, which I’m doing, as you have seen, I have said he was unqualified to be president. I believe that deeply. I’m going to keep focused on Donald Trump because I will be the nominee. I will be running against Donald Trump in the fall, and I do not want Americans and, you know, good thinking Republicans as well as Democrats and Independents, to start to believe that this is a normal candidacy. It isn’t. What he is advocating, look what he’s done this past week. you know, attacking our closest ally, England. He heaping praise on a dangerous dictator in North Korea. Reiterating his call to pull out of NATO, talking about letting other countries have nuclear weapons. advocating a return to torture and even murdering the families of suspected terrorists. That is beyond the pale. And it poses immediate dangers. I go around the country, Chuck, all the time. And in my events in the last few weeks, I have had Republicans coming to tell me they are supporting me. They have different reasons. For a lot of women, it’s the divisive, demeaning comments that Donald Trump has made about women. For others, a businessman just told me yesterday in Texas, he said ‘I’m a Republican, I always voted Republican. I’m here giving you money, supporting you, because I do business all over the world, and I’m watching what this Trump effect is doing to our standing in the world.’ Follow Pam Key on Twitter @pamkeyNEN
