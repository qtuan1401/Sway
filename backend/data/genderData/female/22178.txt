A University of   university professor who used a December 28 Facebook tirade to say “F**k the law,” “F**k police,” and “F**k the NRA” was allowed to meet President Obama after his January 13 speech in Omaha. [The professor’s name is Amanda Gailey. She is also the director of Nebraskans Against Gun Violence.  Here is Gailey’s Facebook rant in it’s entirety: F**k the society that has allowed itself to become so saturated in guns that it’s plausible a child might have one at a park. F**k the laws that allow toy makers to make toys that look like real guns and that allow gun makers to make guns that look like toys. F**k racists who think black children look like adults. F**k a legal and police system that allows grown white men to pose with sniper rifles on a university campus or in a grocery store and allows insurrectionists to train guns on government agents with no consequences but sounds the alarms when a black child is carrying a toy gun. F**k police officers who undertook a job that carries inherent risk but think any perceived threat to them whatsoever justifies instantaneous lethal force. F**k police officers who pull up as close as possible to an alleged threat so that they can execute the person as quickly as possible without assessing the situation first. F**k prosecutors who can indict a ham sandwich but can’t indict a cop who executed a child. And f**k the NRA for greasing this machine every fucking day with the blood of American children. On January 14 —  weeks after the original post was put up —  Gailey put up another post in which she attempted to explain that her criticism of police was limited to “  officers,” not good ones. And she was specifically outraged by the fact that the no charges were filed against officers who shot 195 pound,    Tamir Rice after a 911 dispatcher told officers “a young man [was] playing with a weapon and pointing it at people outside of a local recreation center. ” Gailey wrote: I did write a Facebook post that expressed my outrage at the police shooting of a    child and the failure to indict the   police officers involved. My criticism of the police was limited to those officers who engage in that kind of policing, which I believe is clear in my post. I did not malign the police in general, nor did I want to, because I respect the many good officers who serve our communities and have even helped me in the past. I know that most police officers are doing hard work in hard conditions, and they are in the front lines of a society saturated in guns, facing threats that police in our peer nations do not. They are key players in our struggle for safe and fair communities. This is Gailey’s explanation for “F**k the police” as well as “F**k the society,” “F**k the laws,” and “F**k the NRA,” among other things. Senator Ben Sasse ( .) has come out and expressed his shock that the administration allowed someone who said these things to meet the President. Sasse wrote, “Hopefully, this was just a vetting mistake by the White House and not a statement of support for her views by the President. Either way, this is troubling. ” Follow AWR Hawkins on Twitter: @AWRHawkins. Reach him directly at awrhawkins@breitbart. com.
