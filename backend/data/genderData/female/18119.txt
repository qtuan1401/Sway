  Donald Trump has delivered his first Thanksgiving message, in which he urged the nation to work together after a bruising election campaign.[    We are very blessed to call this nation our home and that’s what America is it is our home. It’s where we raise our families, care for a loved ones, look out for our neighbors and live out our dreams. It’s my prayer that on this Thanksgiving we begin to heal our divisions and move forward as one country, strengthened by shared purpose and very very common resolve. In declaring this national holiday, President Lincoln called upon Americans to speak with one voice and one heart. That’s just what we have to do. We’ve just finished a long and bruising political campaign. Emotions are raw and tensions just don’t heal overnight it doesn’t go quickly, unfortunately. But we have before us the chance now to make history together. To bring real change to Washington, real safety to our cities and real prosperity to our communities, including our inner cities  —   so important to me and so important to our country. But to succeed, we must enlist the effort of our entire nation. This historic political campaign is now over. But now begins a great national campaign to rebuild our country and to restore the full promise of America for all of our people. I’m asking you to join me in this effort. It’s time to restore the bonds of trust between citizens because what America is unified, there is nothing beyond our reach, and I mean absolutely nothing. Let us give thanks for all the we have and let as boldly face the exciting new frontiers that lie ahead. Thank you. God bless you and God bless America.
