President Barack Obama falsely claimed Tuesday that his daughter Sasha uses Twitter like Republican candidate Donald Trump. [Appearing with Hillary Clinton at a rally in North Carolina, Obama said that “Everybody can tweet,” referring to Trump, whose politically incorrect tweets have become famous and sparked a minor cultural revolution. “But nobody actually knows what it takes to do the job until you’ve sat behind the desk. ”  “I mean, Sasha tweets, but she doesn’t think that she’s thereby should be sitting behind the desk,” Obama added. Contrary to the president’s claims, Sasha Obama does not have a verified Twitter account and all accounts for her on Twitter appear to be obvious fakes. The talking point rings false. People are now frantically searching for Sasha Obama’s secret twitter account.  —   Lucy (@LucyLyrical) July 5, 2016,    The Obama family previously said that its children do not have social media accounts on sites like Facebook, due to their fame. Obama has a habit of invoking his children as storytale props in his political anecdotes, as at this year’s White House Correspondents’ Dinner when he speculated that Bernie Sanders would allow Malia to go to Burning Man against the president’s wishes.
