Sen. Kirsten Gillibrand ( ) has been using some choice language in recent weeks, frequently dropping the “F” bomb, in a stark contrast to the 2016 campaign where Democrats lambasted   Trump for his language  —   and warned “our children our watching. ”[Gillibrand, who has been floated as a possible 2020 candidate for the Democrats, spoke Thursday in front of a Personal Democracy Forum in New York City, and didn’t hold back in what she thought of President Trump.  “Has he kept his promises? No, F*ck No! ,” she said, according to The Hill. She also had a stark warning for other lawmakers, presumably including fellow Democrats, about being productive in Congress. “If we are not helping people, we should go the f*ck home,” she said. It isn’t the first time Gillibrand has popped off in such a way. In April, she used a similar line in an interview with New York Magazine. In that instance, she also talked about being a newbie in the Senate and not knowing how to get a bill passed. “‘How do I do this? I have no f*cking clue,’” she recalled for the magazine. It seems to be part of a wider strategy of Democrats to be edgier in the wake of their defeat in November. Democratic National Committee Chair Tom Perez, in April, said Trump’s “skinny budget” was, in fact, a “shi*ty budget. ” The new   Democratic strategy is a stark contrast to a central pillar of their presidential campaign  —   including an ad called “Our Children Are Watching” in which young children were shown somberly watching President Trumps’ more colorful statements. “What example will we set for them?” it asked.
