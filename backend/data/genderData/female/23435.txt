Friday on MSNBC’s “Morning Joe,” while commenting on the changes in Republican presidential nominee Donald Trump since his campaign manager Kellyanne Conway has been at the helm, former McCain and Bush strategist Nicolle Wallace admitted her family life was “in shatters” because of her parents’ support of Trump.  “I’m not defending Donald Trump,” Wallace said. “My family life is in shatters because my parents support Donald Trump. I’m just telling you that out in the country people experience Donald Trump in the Kellyanne Conway era as someone who has been able to go on a stage and say, ‘Sometimes my words hurt some people’. And I’m not giving him points for that. I am not grading him on a curve but voters gave him a second look when he said that. I mean her arrival has changed him. ” (  Grabien) Follow Jeff Poor on Twitter @jeff_poor
