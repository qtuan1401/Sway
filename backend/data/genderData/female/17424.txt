Khan fired a series of questions at Trump during the rally, as the audience screamed a response to each one. KHIZR KHAN: Donald Trump, would my son, Captain Humayun Khan, have a place in your America?” AUDIENCE: “No!” KHIZR KHAN: “Would Muslims have a place in your America?” AUDIENCE: “No!” KHIZR KHAN: “Would Latinos have a place in your America?” AUDIENCE: “No!” KHIZR KHAN: “Would African Americans have a place in your America, Donald Trump?” AUDIENCE: “No!” KHIZR KHAN: “Would anyone who isn’t like you have a place in your America, Donald Trump?” AUDIENCE: “No!” He described Clinton as the president who would “preserve fundamental American values” as he welcomed her to the stage.
