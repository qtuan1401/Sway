’  ’ ’   Hillary Clinton on Saturday walked back comments she made about   supporters of Donald Trump at an event in New York City. ’ ’   Clinton said on Friday evening that you could put half of the   Republican presidential nominee’’s supporters in a ”,” which she said would include racists,   xenophobes, and homophobes. ’ ’   But, following a firestorm of backlash, Clinton released a   statement saying her comments were ”grossly generalistic,” and   that she regretted denigrating ”half” of Trump’’s supporters. ’ ’   While she offered remorse for her comments, Clinton also said it   was ”deplorable” that Trump has built his campaign ”largely on   prejudice and paranoia” and has ”given a national platform to   hateful views and voices.” ’ ’   ”As I said, many of Trump’’s supporters are   Americans   who just don’t feel like the economy or our political system are   working for them,” she added. ’ ’   Clinton resolved to try to ”bring our country together” and ”make   our economy work for everyone.” ’ ’   Trump, along with his running mate Mike Pence, responded on   Saturday by criticizing the comments Hillary made on Friday. ’ ’   ”Wow,  ’ ’ ’ ’ ’t’t’tWow, Hillary Clinton was SO INSULTING to my supporters, millions of amazing, hard working people. I think it will cost her at the Polls! ’t’t’ ’   Pence piled on, saying at the Values Voter Summit that Clinton’’s   ”low opinion” of Trump’’s supporters should be ”denounced in the   strongest possible terms.” ’ ’   ” ’ ’  ’ ’  ’
