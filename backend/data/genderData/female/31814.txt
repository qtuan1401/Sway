Washington (CNN) House Speaker Paul Ryan and his team will meet with members of   Donald Trump’s transition team Monday evening to discuss the House GOP tax reform framework, a senior House GOP aide told CNN. Ryan and his team will walk Trump’s transition team through the House GOP tax proposal released last year in the Republican Party’s ”A Better Way” agenda.  The Washington Post first reported the meeting. The senior House GOP aide deferred to the Trump transition team to confirm the participants coming from their side.

Trump and Ryan have agreed on the past on cutting taxes and simplifying the tax code    but their comparisons stop there. Trump has supported trade protectionism and tariffs, while Ryan supports   agreements. These differences could pose problems in their discussions on tax reform framework.
