From the Hollywood Reporter:  Donald Trump will not be a part of the Fox News town hall hosted by Megyn Kelly on Wednesday.  The GOP presidential frontrunner had a prior commitment that could not be changed on short notice, according to a Trump campaign spokeswoman. “The campaign has a previous engagement in Virginia and then New York, which could not be rescheduled,” Trump spokesperson Hope Hicks said in an email to The Hollywood Reporter. “Given this was just proposed at the last minute, it was not possible to change our plans in order to attend. ” The   voter summit taking place in Houston, The Kelly File: Face to Face With Candidates, will feature the four additional remaining Republican candidates, according to Fox News. Those men are Dr. Ben Carson, Sen. Ted Cruz, Sen. Marco Rubio and Gov. John Kasich, who will join the event via remote.
