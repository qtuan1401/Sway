An online campaign to boycott Beyoncé and her music has picked up steam since the pop star performed a controversial tribute to the Black Panthers during the Super Bowl halftime show on Sunday. [Social media users have been using the hashtag #BoycottBeyonce in response to the halftime show performance, which many, including former New York City Mayor Rudy Giuliani, viewed as an overt attack on police officers.  During the halftime show, Beyoncé performed her new single “Formation,” the video of which is filled with Black Lives Matter and   enforcement imagery. The singer’s backup dancers donned black leather outfits and black berets in an apparent homage to the militant Black Panther Party, formed an X on the field in what many have called a tribute to Malcolm X, and later posed backstage with fists raised in a “black power” salute. @Beyonce is a racist and we won’t stand for it #boycottbeyonce. I’m ashamed she’s from Houston the greatest city in the world.  —   Hispanics for Trump (@talltexanrealty) February 10, 2016,  @Mets please cancel the @Beyonce shows at @CitiField @Citi #BlueLivesMatter #boycottbeyonce,  —   Milez25 (@Milez25NYC) February 10, 2016,  @OshaneBlackwin When you have a no talent like Beyonce, I suppose extremist race hustling is expected. #BoycottBeyonce,  —   Mark G (@markg0077) February 10, 2016,  Strongly behind and totally support the #boycottbeyonce movement!!  —   Erik Ronian (@ronian30) February 10, 2016,  Critics of the performance have been using the #BoycottBeyonce hashtag to promote an   rally called for Tuesday, February 16, outside NFL headquarters in Manhattan. Others have called for venues on the singer’s upcoming “Formation” tour to cancel performances. “Are you offended as an American that Beyoncé pulled her   stunt at the Superbowl?” the event page for the protest reads. “Do you agree that it was a slap in the face to law enforcement?   …     Come and let’s stand together. Let’s tell the NFL we don’t want hate speech and racism at the Superbowl ever again!” Beyoncé’s performance was praised by her fans and members of the Black Lives Matter movement, and of course, social media users have rushed to defend her in the wake of the controversy: I will NOT #boycottbeyonce she didnt do anything wrong I will acknowledge the fact she stood for #blacklivesmmatter which is beautiful.  —   jazzi (@jazzima) February 10, 2016,  Please search #BoycottBeyonce on Twitter, it’s soooo funny to see white people pissed.  —   young val (@twentyonesixval) February 10, 2016,  #boycottbeyonce seriously?!
