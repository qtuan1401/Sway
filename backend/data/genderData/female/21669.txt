Sunday on CBS’s ‘Face the Nation,” Republican National Committee chairman Reince Priebus said of the 2016 GOP presidential primary candidates who are not supporting Republican presidential nominee Donald Trump, “If they’re thinking they’re going to run again some day, you know I think that we’re going to evaluate the process of the nomination process and I don’t think it’s going to be that easy for them. ”  Priebus said, “People who agreed to support the nominee. They took part in our process. They used tools from the RNC. They agreed to support the nominee. They took part in our process. We are a private party. We’re in the a public entity. Those people need to get on board. And if they’re thinking they’re going to run again some day, you know I think that we’re going to evaluate the process of the nomination process and I don’t think it’s going to be that easy for them. ” He added, “People in our party are talking about what we’re going to do about this. There is a ballot access issue in South Carolina. In order to be on the ballot in South Carolina, you actually have to pledge your support to the nominee, no matter who that is? So what’s the penalty for that? It’s not a threat. It’s just a question. We have a process in place. And if a private entity puts forward a process and has agreement with the participants in that process, then those participants don’t follow through with the promises that they made in that process, what should a private party do about that if those same people come around in four or eight years?” Follow Pam Key on Twitter @pamkeyNEN
