Donald Trump campaign manager Corey Lewandowski tells Breitbart Daily News host Stephen K. Bannon today, neither he nor Trump are fighting for second place in Iowa, “I’d love to say second place is great but it’s not. I know that’s a terrible expectation to set but our country needs to win, again. And that’s the mindset we need to have if we’re going to be successful. ”[“The mindset of this campaign is to go out and work as hard as humanly possible to finish first,” he added later.  Lewandowski urged all Trump supporters to go out and caucus in Iowa today, directing them to the campaign’s website if they were unsure of their designated location. He then went on to address expressed concerns about Trump acting like an authoritarian if he wins the White House and also concerns regarding his conservatism, pointing out his belief that Donald Trump is clearly the best candidate suited to get America turned around, as many voters believe the nation is in decline.
