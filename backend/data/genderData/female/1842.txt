(Want to get this briefing by email? Here’s the  .) Good evening. Here’s the latest. 1. President Trump stood by his wiretapping claim at a news conference with Angela Merkel. The background: On Thursday, his top spokesman, Sean Spicer, had repeated an unverified claim that Britain’s spy agency monitored Mr. Trump during the campaign at the behest of President Barack Obama. The British were furious, but Mr. Trump made clear that he saw no reason to apologize. During the Obama years, Ms. Merkel, the German leader, had been angered by reports that the U. S. had tapped her phone. Turning to her at the White House on Friday, Mr. Trump said, “At least we have something in common, perhaps. ” _____ 2. Secretary of State Rex Tillerson said for the first time that the Trump administration might take   action if North Korea’s nuclear threat reached an unacceptable level. During a visit to South Korea, Mr. Tillerson ruled out negotiations with the North over its nuclear and missile programs. Whether he takes a hard line with China  —   where he is headed next  —   over its support for North Korea will be closely watched, as will be the response of China. _____ 3. More grim developments in Syria and Yemen: In Syria, the country’s armed forces fired missiles at Israeli warplanes near Palmyra, in what appeared to be the most serious clash between the two militaries in years. The U. S. military denied reports that it had bombed a Syrian mosque, but confirmed that a nearby building was struck. A human rights group said 42 people were killed. Above, the volunteer rescue group the White Helmets dug through the rubble. Off the coast of Yemen, more than 30 Somali migrants were killed when a military helicopter opened fire on their boat. Yemeni officials blamed a   military coalition for the attack. _____ 4. As a Marine sergeant, James LaPorta once led an intelligence team in Afghanistan. Now, as a private citizen, he is tracking the moves of a Facebook group that has been secretly compiling and sharing nude photos of hundreds of women in the Marine Corps. “The Marine Corps can’t do this alone. The internet is too huge,” Mr. LaPorta said. “We need to police ourselves. ” _____ 5. The Nobel laureate Derek Walcott died at 87. His poetry captured the beauty of the Caribbean and the harsh legacy of colonialism. Here are some lines from his work: _____ 6. A new heart drug could be a   but it comes with a high price: $14, 523 a year. Those who took the drug Repatha were significantly less likely to have heart attacks or strokes, researchers found in a new study. The drug, manufactured by Amgen, has the potential to help millions of Americans with heart disease, which is the nation’s leading killer. Robert Johnson, above with his daughters, says he feels “much safer” taking the drug. His father died of a heart attack at 42. _____ 7. Our personal finance writer delves into our nation’s maddeningly complex system of financial aid for higher education. His conclusion: “If you have a child who is already walking and talking and you will not be able to write a check to pay tuition, it’s best to start studying up on it now or finding a political candidate to support who will blow it all up. ” _____ 8. We explored the beautiful, eerie world beneath the ice in northern Quebec to hunt for fresh mussels. In the coldest months of the year, when the ice is thickest and unusually large tides empty the bay under it, some Inuit people venture into the luminous ice caves. The mussels, a welcome winter treat these days, were at one time a lifesaving source of food. _____ 9. Happy St. Patrick’s Day. We assembled a collection of recipes you might want to explore this weekend, including traditional fare like corned beef, Guinness pie and soda bread. And then there are some green dishes that don’t require food coloring, like the Green Goddess dressing of herbs, garlic and anchovies above. _____ 10. Finally, what to watch this weekend? Here are some ideas: the movies that influenced “Get Out” new original content on Amazon and the N. C. A. A. tournament. “Beauty and the Beast” also opens in theaters. Jimmy Kimmel used his   for the new movie to take another swipe at the president. Have a great weekend. _____ Photographs may appear out of order for some readers.
