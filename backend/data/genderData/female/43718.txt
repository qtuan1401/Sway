’Donald Trump invited a supporter on stage during his   rally in Melbourne, Florida and let him speak to the crowd. He specifically gave the man instructions to ignore security, and insisted that he could be trusted. ’ ’FULL TRANSCRIPT:’ ’Trump: And I saw this man on television just now, you. I just saw him on television. He said, ”I love trump. Let Trump do what he has to do.” That’’s my guy, right there. It’’s true. Come here, come here. No, I just  —   I’’m coming in  —   That’’s okay, let him up, let him up. I’’m not worried about him. I’’m only worried he’’s going to give me a kiss. I’’m not worried about anything else. This guy is so great. He was one of many people  —   they’’re interviewing people in the line, and I have to say, there’’s a tiny group of protesters out there, and they were given as much publicity as this massive room packed with people. But they interviewed this man, come on up here. Come on up. Guy was great. Hop over the fence, come on. Come on up, come on. Come here, come here. This guy. So, he’’s been all over television, saying the best things, and I see him standing  —   and didn’’t you get here like at four in the morning? ’ ’Supporter: I did sir.’ ’Trump: Say a couple of words to this crowd.’ ’Supporter: Mr. President, thank you sir. We the people, our movement, is the reason why our president of the United States is standing here in front of us today. When President Trump, during their election, promised all these things that he was gonna do for us, I knew he was gonna do this for us. ’
