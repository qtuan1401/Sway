Soul legend Sam Moore delivered a rousing rendition of “America the Beautiful” at the “Make America Great Again: Welcome Celebration” on Thursday. [Flanked by a chorus of backup singers, the Sam  Dave “soul man” performed the American classic in front of an audience of thousands, including   Donald Trump and his wife Melania, and Trump’s children.  In a statement before his performance, Moore said that he was “honored” to perform as part of Trump’s inauguration ceremony, and said he would not bow to pressure from   activists to cancel his performance. “We all as Americans need to unite behind our new President and give him a chance. He needs everyone’s support to make America greater, stronger and an even better country,” Moore said. “I am not going to let them, the left side, intimidate me from doing what I feel is the right thing to do for the country and that [presidential] seal,” he added, according to the Associated Press. “Give the man a shot. He hasn’t even said ‘I do’ yet. Give him a chance. If you don’t like him after four years, then don’t vote for him next time. ” Other performers at the   concert included country artists Toby Keith and Lee Greenwood, rock band 3 Doors Down and piano virtuosos The Piano Guys.
