According to the New Hampshire exit polls, a full 66% of Republican voters back a “ban on Muslims from entering the U. S. ” This obviously is good news for Donald Trump, who proposed a temporary ban on foreign Muslims entering the country until our government is in a better position to avoid another Sacramento terror attack. The female jihadist who committed that terror attack was here on a fiancée visa.  By all accounts, Trump made this proposal based only on his instincts, not any kind of focus group polling. Every other candidate in the Republican primary disagreed with the proposal, many outright condemned it as bigotry.  —   Two thirds of NH voters back Muslim ban. pic. twitter.   —   John Nolte (@NolteNC) February 9, 2016,   —     Follow John Nolte on Twitter @NolteNC
