Well, that didn’t take long. [On Wednesday, we brought you the story of Under Armour CEO Kevin Plank who, in an interview with CNBC, referred to President Trump as “bold,” “decisive,” and “a real asset to the country. ”  Those comments did not sit well with the left. Several activists and enraged leftists took to twitter to voice their outrage at Plank, using the #BoycottUnderArmour hash tag: Hold on @UnderArmour, maybe I wasn’t clear.
