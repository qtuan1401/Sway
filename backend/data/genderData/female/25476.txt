On Monday’s “The O’Reilly Factor” on the Fox News Channel, host Bill O’Reilly reacted to events in Chicago on Friday that led to the cancellation of a campaign event for GOP presidential hopeful Donald Trump.  O’Reilly placed blame on   elements, including the liberal group MoveOn. Org, for staging the protests and attacked the media for blaming Trump himself for the “fracas. ” However, O’Reilly suggested that although Trump’s critics have accused him of having fascist tendencies, it was those critics that were practicing fascism for seeking to shut down opposing points of view. “Opposition to Donald Trump here is not the issue,” O’Reilly said. “True fascism is. We have seen some   people use the fascist salute while taunting Trump supporters. But here’s the very simple question.  Shutting down opposing points of view is totalitarian, right? So some of the very people accusing Trump supporters of being fascist are really practicing that terrible philosophy themselves. ” Follow Jeff Poor on Twitter @jeff_poor
