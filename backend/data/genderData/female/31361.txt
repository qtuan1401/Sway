GOP frontrunner Donald Trump tells Breitbart News Daily on SiriusXM host Stephen K. Bannon why he thinks Hillary Clinton will be easy to beat in the general election. [“I would say, I’ve gone against a lot of very talented people [with] the Republicans and    they drop off,” Trump explained. “I just feel she’s so flawed. ”  “I don’t know if she’ll even be able to run because of [her] email scandal,” Trump added, saying the scandal is “a problem for her. ” “She wants to have open borders with people flying through,” Trump said of Clinton’s immigration policy. “We can’t have that. ” “People want strength today and she doesn’t have strength and she doesn’t have stamina,” Trump charged.
