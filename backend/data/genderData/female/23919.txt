Commenting on former president Bill Clinton’s suggestion that Detroit should be repopulated with and rebuilt by refugees from Syria, Dr. Ben Carson told Breitbart News Daily on SiriusXM that “we need to take care of our own people. We need to create jobs for them. That’s relatively easy to do. ”[Carson joined SiriusXM host Alex Marlow on Friday’s Breitbart News Daily to offer a preview of Donald Trump’s upcoming interview with Bishop Wayne T. Jackson of Detroit for the Impact Network.  Marlow asked Carson about former president Bill Clinton’s suggestion that Detroit should be repopulated with, and rebuilt by, refugees from Syria. “If it’s Bill Clinton that’s suggesting it, I would examine it very carefully,” Carson laughed. “You know, there are plenty of people in Detroit who you could almost look at as refugees. I mean, we need to take care of our own people. We need to create jobs for them. That’s relatively easy to do. ” “You look, for instance, at the over $2 trillion overseas, that’s not being brought back because of our high tax rate. Lets’ bring that money back, incentivize it to be brought back by getting rid of the taxes on it, but requiring that 10 percent of it be used in enterprise zones, and to create jobs for people who are unemployed or underemployed,” he suggested. “It would be the biggest stimulus since FDR’s New Deal, and it wouldn’t cost the taxpayers one penny. ” “Those are the kinds of things we need to do, because then it gets corporate America once again involved in their communities. And they used to be, before the government took over everything and messed it up,” Carson said. Breitbart News Daily airs on SiriusXM Patriot 125 weekdays from 6:00 a. m. to 9:00 a. m. Eastern.
