Tuesday on CNN’s “The Lead,” when asked about Republican presidential   Donald Trump’s convention manager Paul Manafort’s comments last week at a Republican National Committee meeting saying that Trump is playing a “part,” Trump’s campaign manager Corey Lewandowski said the comments meant Trump tailors his messaging based on crowd size, but added “Donald Trump will never change. ”  Lewandowski said, “What you have, as you know, Mr. Trump —  when he goes to an event, he speaks to massive crowds and wants to make sure they understand what his message is. His messaging in large crowds is tailor made to that large crowd. In a small audience, as you would anybody else, a different way that you speak to people in a smaller crowd. That’s what Paul was trying to get across. What you’ll see tomorrow from Mr. Trump, detailed foreign policy speech in Washington, we’ll go out to Indiana, which coach Bobby Knight is joining us for a massive, raucous crowd, something that many people on the channel have had the opportunity to see because you cover it well usually. Again, what Paul is talking about in smaller meetings, when Donald Trump is    with someone, he may not be having the same type of loud, verbose conversation because it’s a more private intimate setting. But the message is the same, Donald Trump will never change. The motto of the campaign has been and will continue to be ‘Let Mr. Trump be Mr. Trump. ’” Follow Pam Key On Twitter @pamkeyNEN
