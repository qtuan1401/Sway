The event’s organizer, Lucian Wintrich (known for his “Twinks for Trump” photoseries) had to scramble to find a second venue after the exhibitions original location, the Pierogi Art Gallery property The Boiler, abruptly cancelled  —   and then threatened to sue Wintrich and “ruin his reputation in the art world. ” Wintrich was previously fired from his job over his support for Trump, which MILO praised in an article.
