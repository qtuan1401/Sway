’   CNN anchor Jake Tapper on Sunday confronted Donald Trump’’s   campaign chair, Paul Manafort, about a campaign official’’s   assertion that the family of a slain Muslim soldier does not   deserve the ”Gold Star” title. ’ ”   Khizr Khan, the father of a   soldier who died   protecting his unit in Iraq,  of Trump’s previous suggestion to   ban all Muslims from entering the US. ” ’   This week,  ’ ’   ”Do you think that by having Mr. Paladino continue to serve as   your New York cochair, you’’re dishonoring the military?” Tapper   asked. ’ ’ ’ ’Trump campaign manager on their NY   attacking the Khans: ”I’’d have to check into the situation”  ’ ”   After claiming that he was unfamiliar with Paladino’s comments,   Manafort quickly criticized Democratic presidential nominee   Hillary Clinton’s campaign over Seddique Mateen’s appearance   in the crowd at a Clinton campaign rally in Florida last week.   Mateen’s son killed 49 people in a terrorist shooting at a   nightclub in Orlando, Florida, earlier this year. ” ’’ ’   ”I wonder how he could get into that speech. He’’s an avowed   Islamic radical. That concerned me. She’’s totally ignored that   fact,” Manafort said. ’ ”   When Tapper noted that Manafort dodged the CNN anchor’s question,   Manafort noted that he would look into the comments. ” ’   ”I don’’t know about the quote. I’’ll have to check into the   situation. Certainly Mr. Trump has made it very clear he   recognizes the sacrifices of all Gold Star parents, and he   empathizes for that loss,” Manafort said. ’ ’   Trump has refused to back away from his criticism of Khan,   saying that the   lawyer has ”” to question Trump’’s understanding of the US   constitution. ’
