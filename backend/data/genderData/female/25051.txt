Tom Brady reportedly has decided not to speak at the Republican National Convention despite his support for Donald Trump. [The presumptive Republican presidential nominee says he wants “winners” rather than politicians to fill prominent roles at the proceedings. “We’re going to do it a little different, if that’s OK,” Trump said last month. “I’m thinking about getting some of the great sports people who like me a lot. ”  But according to one reporter covering the NFL, Brady, whose Patriots training camp does not start until about a week after the convention ends, will not speak at the event. Despite speculation to contrary, Pats QB Tom Brady will not be attending Republican National Convention in Cleveland this month, per source.  —   Adam Schefter (@AdamSchefter) July 5, 2016,  Brady placed a red “Make America Great Again” hat conspicuously in his locker last year and repeatedly spoke favorably of Trump. “I support all my friends in everything they do,” he said last season about Trump. “I think it’s pretty remarkable what he’s achieved in his life. You’re going from business, kind of an incredible business man and then a TV star, and then getting into politics. It’s a pretty different career path. I think that is pretty remarkable. ” Sports figures publicly supporting Trump include Mike Ditka, Bob Knight, Mike Tyson, Tito Ortiz, Herschel Walker, and Lou Holtz. “I hope so,” Brady said last September of a Trump presidency. “That would be great. There’d be a putting green on the White House lawn. I’m sure of that. ”
