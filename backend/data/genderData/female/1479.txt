(Want to get this briefing by email? Here’s the  .) Good evening. Here’s the latest. 1. Attorney General Jeff Sessions recused himself from any investigation into Russian meddling in the 2016 election, but denied that his newly revealed contacts with a Russian official were related to the presidential campaign. Democratic leaders called on Mr. Sessions to resign. Republicans confronted a widening split in their ranks over how to proceed amid a growing uproar over questions about the Trump team’s ties to Russia, even as they mostly resisted calls for a special prosecutor or select committee. The White House disclosed that Michael Flynn, the national security adviser, and Jared Kushner, the president’s    and senior adviser, also met with the Russian ambassador in December. As we reported, the outgoing Obama administration scrambled to preserve intelligence about the campaign’s possible contacts with Russia by spreading it across the government. _____ 2. On Capitol Hill, Ben Carson, the    was confirmed as secretary of housing and urban development. And Rick Perry, the former Texas governor, got final approval to lead the Energy Department, a role that puts him in charge of the country’s nuclear arsenal. Another administration official, the new secretary of the interior, Ryan Zinke of Montana, arrived at his new office on horseback. _____ 3. Republican lawmakers in at least 16 states are trying to rein in protests with bills to make them more orderly or to toughen penalties when they go awry. Some of the bills are backed by the president’s supporters, and some appear to be responses to demonstrations against him and his policies. One activist called the proposals “intimidation from the right. ” _____ 4. Shares of Snap Inc. valued at $24 billion in its public offering, jumped 41 percent in the company’s first day of trading.

Syrian government forces again drove Islamic State militants out of Palmyra, the ancient city that was prewar Syria’s leading tourist attraction. The Islamic State had used the city as a propaganda windfall, making a sport out of pilfering and vandalizing prized antiquities it considered heretical, and using the Roman theater for public beheadings. _____ 6. A year after the European Union closed its borders to asylum seekers, tens of thousands of refugees languish in camps in Greece, many of them children. Their lives in limbo have taken on an air of permanence. “Everyone here feels depressed,” said a young Afghan. _____ 7. China has at least 10 White Houses, four Arcs de Triomphe, a couple of Great Sphinxes and at least one Eiffel Tower. But a replica of London’s Tower Bridge, celebrated as “even more magnificent” than the original, has set off a debate over whether these buildings  —   created as publicity stunts and popular as photo backdrops  —   are actually denigrating Chinese culture. _____ 8. A few prominent artists are working to preserve the   house where Nina Simone was born, in the Blue Ridge Mountains of North Carolina. A previous owner had invested in period 1930s details, hoping to make it into a museum for the legendary singer and civil rights icon, who died in 2003 at age 70. But the project languished. “She formed a lot of who I am and my sense of history,” said one of the artists. “And I think of the town as a portal to a woman who influenced so many. ” _____ 9.

The jump has set off a scramble to adjust a festival schedule expected to involve up to 1. 5 million people. _____ Photographs may appear out of order for some readers.
