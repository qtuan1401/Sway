During her politically charged   performance, the Material Girl reportedly railed against the U. S. and the destruction of Native American land. “It just really makes me feel ashamed, ashamed to be an American, ashamed to be a human being really,” Madonna said according to the Associated Press. The stars who showed up Friday night include Leonardo DiCaprio, Chris Rock, Dave Chappelle, and James Corden.
