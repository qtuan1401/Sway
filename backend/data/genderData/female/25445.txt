CIA Director John Brennan said Sunday in an interview with NBC News that the CIA “would not agree” to carry out waterboarding again, even if commanded by a future president.  GOP presidential candidates Donald Trump and Sen. Ted Cruz ( ) have both said they would be for the use of waterboarding in some capacity. Trump is in favor of going “beyond” waterboarding, while Cruz stated the act is needed in some cases. “Absolutely, I would not agree to having any CIA officer carrying out waterboarding again,” Brennan said.
