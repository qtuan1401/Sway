Columnist James Poulos writes that Marco Rubio, “poster child for the [Republican] party’s hopefulness of audacity has simply failed. ” [From The Week:  As important as it is for Republicans to comprehend why Trump and Cruz have done so well, they could benefit even more from coming to terms with why Rubio has done so poorly.
