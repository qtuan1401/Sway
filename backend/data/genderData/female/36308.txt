Washington (CNN) Donald Trump’s campaign unveiled Saturday a modified version of its   logo after the original graphic drew a lot of unintended attention. During Trump’s official introduction of Indiana Gov. Mike Pence as his running mate, the campaign adorned a fundraising email with a simple ”TRUMP” atop a ”PENCE,” ditching an American   interlocking T and P logo that attracted the attention of Trump critics and supporters alike. The campaign shared the original graphic in an email soon after making public Trump’s choice Friday in a series of social media posts, emails and text messages. In the original insignia, the ”T” in Trump passes through the ”P” in Pence as part of a flag illustration. Their names were stacked below on top of Trump’s slogan, ”Make America Great Again.” Asked about the modified logo, Trump campaign spokesman Jason Miller told CNN, ”We have a number of logos. The final one won’t be unveiled until the convention.” Former Michigan Rep. John Dingell, a Democrat with a famously wry Twitter account, offered one of the first of many puzzled reviews of the earlier design. ”What is the T doing to that P?” he asked.  Florida congressman and Senate candidate Alan Grayson, a Democrat, volunteered an   suggestion. ”This logo accurately represents what Trump Pence will do to America,” he tweeted. And Bloomberg’s Matt Negrin did his best to make the logo ”safe for TV.” For the many NSFW takes on Trump and Pence’s branding, simply search Twitter.
