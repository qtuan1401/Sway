’  ’ ’   An Italian looking at America’s political present sees uncanny   resemblances to his own country’s recent past. ’ ’   In 1994, a cartoonish,        —  one with little experience in   politics but a penchant for theatrics —  ran for the country’s   highest political office. Despite a checkered business history   (everything from alleged organized crime ties to tax fraud) as   well as a tendency to play fast and loose with facts, he was   elected by voters fed up with establishment politicians. ’ ’   Given the similarities to Donald Trump, it’s no surprise that   political observers have turned to Silvio Berlusconi for some   hint of what is to come for the United States. And because the   Berlusconi chapter in Italian history is now in the rearview   mirror, Italian researchers are well into the postmortem of his   reign. It isn’t pretty. A careful study of Berlusconi’s TV empire   reveals the manifold ways in which companies can curry favor with   a politician who doesn’t give up his businesses, as well as the     of policing such  . The results   should further unnerve those concerned about conflicts created by   Donald Trump’s business holdings. ’ ’   Italy is one of a number of countries that place minimal   restrictions on the business activities of politicians. Thus   Giovanni Agnelli, a major shareholder in carmaker Fiat, was able   to serve as a lifetime member of the Italian senate until his   death in 2003, without divesting his stake in the company. (In   Italy, a small number of senators are appointed rather than   elected.) Likewise, when Berlusconi ascended to the highest   office in the land, he retained ownership over his Mediaset   empire, which owned the three TV channels that presented the main   alternative to   RAI TV stations. ’ ’   The lack of constraints on business interests has its advantages.   It may allow Italians to draw on a broad pool of political   aspirants, for example. But it also creates obvious conflicts of   interest, which is why most countries —  the U. S. included —  limit the   business activities of politicians and bureaucrats. You might not   want an auto executive devising regulations on fuel standards or   car safety because, consciously or not, he might write the rules   to maximize his company’s profits, not the social welfare.   Perhaps anticipating that Agnelli would do exactly this,   investors drove Fiat’s stock price up by over 3 percent when his   lifetime senate appointment was announced. ’ ’   Berlusconi’s election as prime minister presented vastly greater   opportunities for   than a mere senate appointment.   But none of Berlusconi’s electoral victories were surprises, so   it’s more difficult to gauge whether investors thought it would   add to his companies’ profits. Well before Italians actually cast   their ballots, investors would have bid up Mediaset’s price in   anticipation of a Berlusconi win. ’ ’  ’ ’   A group of Italian and American scholars looked back on the   Berlusconi years for more decisive evidence of corruption.   Berlusconi might have tried to benefit his own companies directly   by, say, ensuring that they received lucrative government   contracts or favorable legislation. But that would have been easy   fodder for Italian journalists and perhaps a bit too much for the   country’s voters. ’ ’   But as the study’s authors point out, politicians also have less   direct —  and less detectable —  methods at their disposal. They   suggest, in particular, that a politician might be able to elicit   benefits from companies controlled by others with the presumption   (though not necessarily the explicit promise) that the favor will   be returned. It’s what the study calls “indirect lobbying,” to   distinguish it from the more immediate and more readily   observable methods that companies and other interest groups   exploit to influence government, like traditional lobbying and   campaign finance. ’ ’   Favors from businesses to politicians are most easily   accomplished when the politician is himself in business, since     businesses can, say, buy goods or services from the   politician’s company at inflated prices (or sell to them at a   discount). This is why we have laws as well as norms that keep   politicians out of business entirely (or at least those   businesses they might oversee in their roles in government). ’ ’   But Italy’s weak laws of divestiture allowed Berlusconi to remain   the dominant shareholder in Mediaset throughout his time in   office. (The firm was headed by one of his children. This should   again be sounding familiar to an American audience.) The TV   business, it turns out, was particularly suited to indirect   lobbying, allowing companies to curry favor with Berlusconi by   overpaying for ads on his network. ’ ’   The Italian media business is also   for enterprising   researchers hoping to detect likely cases of indirect lobbying.   To understand the study’s methodology, consider Berlusconi’s   election in 2001, after six years of sitting on the political   sidelines. Suppose that Fiat had, during 1995 —  2001, spent 55   percent of its television ad budget on RAI commercials and just   45 percent on Mediaset ads. Suppose furthermore that in 2001,   Fiat’s ad spend on Mediaset jumped to 60 percent (leaving just 40   percent for RAI ads). The 15   jump in Mediaset   ads would give us an estimate of how much Fiat was willing to   redirect its advertising expenditures to “lobby” Berlusconi. (We   would also expect ad budgets to shift away from Mediaset   following Berlusconi’s electoral losses.) ’ ’   Berlusconi came into and out of office three times during the   1993 —  2009 period that the researchers focus on. Using     advertising expenditures from Nielsen (the same   company that provides TV show ratings here in the U. S.) for both   Mediaset and its competitor RAI, the study shows that, after   accounting for factors like audience share and sector, Mediaset’s   share of ad spending was about 2. 3 percent higher in the years   that Berlusconi was in office. ’ ’  ’ ’   While this may not sound like much, when multiplied by the   billions spent on advertising during Berlusconi’s nine years in   power, it adds up to over a billion euros in extra Mediaset   profits. The extra revenues weren’t the result of airing more   ads —  Mediaset stations devoted the same fraction of airtime to   advertising regardless of who was in office. Rather, companies   paid consistently higher prices for Mediaset ads when Berlusconi   was in office. ’ ’   RAI, meanwhile, was forced to cut prices when Berlusconi was in   power, so the net effect on ad spending was to shift revenues   from the public coffers (recall that RAI is a     broadcaster) into Berlusconi’s pockets. And Mediaset couldn’t   justify the higher prices because consumers switched their   television allegiances —  audience shares of Mediaset and RAI held   steady across the whole 1993 —  2009 period. Further bolstering the   indirect lobbying interpretation, the advertising effect comes   entirely from highly regulated sectors (like telecommunications,   pharmaceuticals, and construction) whose profits are most easily   affected by government action, rather than loosely regulated ones   (toiletries, toys, apparel). ’ ’   That Berlusconi may have profited to the tune of a billion euros   from serving as prime minister is particularly galling given that   part of his pitch to voters was that he was already so wealthy   that he would be immune to corruption. Trump fed the same line to   disenchanted voters. But as the paper emphasizes, the richer the   politician (or, more to the point, the more extensive his   business interests) the greater the potential for him to profit   from holding office. ’ ’   All of this should be troubling for Americans, especially given   the businesses   Trump happens to be in. Ads on   Mediaset are a boutique product. While it’s now clear, thanks to   the clever work of the authors of this study, that advertisers   overpaid for Mediaset airtime during Berlusconi’s terms in   office, at the time, it was very difficult to detect, as there   was no ready benchmark for the product. ’ ’   Similarly, how are we to know whether companies are overpaying to   license the Trump name to hawk their condos? Or for a night at   the Trump International in Washington, D. C.? It’s difficult to   assess, via stock market responses, whether Donald Trump’s   victory is likely to be a source of   profits. Trump’s   main ventures are privately held, so there is no stock price to   gauge investor’s intuitions. The value of some of his business   partners’ firms have shot up in value —  for example, his Indonesian   partner in a hotel venture saw its stock price increase 23   percent on news of the election outcome. ’ ’   But given the particular business Trump is in, it’s hard to know   what to make of this. Trump’s name is now imbued with much   greater prestige than it was before Nov. 8. People may be willing   to pay more for a   condo or hotel room in New Delhi   or Washington, D. C. even if they aren’t attempting to curry   favor with him. But just as in Berlusconi’s Italy, corporations   with business before his administration will have ample   opportunity to indirectly lobby the president through his   complicated web of business interests. ’ ’   Trump made it abundantly clear in Wednesday’s news conference   that he has no intention of unraveling this tangle of conflicts.   As his lawyer explained, divesting himself of ownership could   expose Trump to “unreasonable losses. ” ’ ’   This makes it all the more likely that political office will   prove to be just as profitable for Trump as it was for his fellow     in Rome. ’
