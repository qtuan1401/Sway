Presumptive Republican nominee Donald Trump’s former campaign manager Corey Lewandowski says he has no professional regrets about how he ran the Trump campaign. [“I have no regrets when it comes to this campaign,” Lewandowski said, but he did add a personal regret. “My biggest regret in the campaign is not being able to have my family more involved. ”  Lewandowski didn’t disclose any reason behind his firing. “I think what’s fair to say is anybody that knows me  …    knows that I’m a very straight shooter,” he told CNN’s Dana Bash on Monday afternoon following the announcement of his removal when asked about people questioning his advice to Trump. “I tell people the way it is. ” “I’m not smart enough to lie,” he added, remaining loyal to Trump during the interview. Lewandowski said his job was to give his best advice and opinion, saying, “That’s my duty and my obligation to anybody. ”
