Washington (CNN) Massachusetts Sen. Elizabeth Warren, who has emerged as perhaps the most prominent Democratic critic of Donald Trump, has found a new Twitter target in his running mate, Mike Pence. Just before Trump introduced the Indiana governor in Manhattan as his No. 2 Saturday, Warren fired off a series of tweets, labeling the real estate mogul and Pence ”small, insecure, weak men.” ”. @realDonaldTrump  @mike_pence are a perfect match: Two small, insecure, weak men who use hate  fear to divide our country  our people,” the Massachusetts Democrat tweeted Saturday. Warren vociferously supports abortion rights for women and hit Pence, who earlier this year signed one of the strictest abortion laws in the country. It bars women from seeking an abortion if the child will be born with a disability. ”Of COURSE  @realDonaldTrump    a guy who calls women fat pigs  bimbos    picked a VP who is famous for trying to control women’s bodies,” the Massachusetts Democrat tweeted.

They’re in line with the party platform,” she tweeted.  Warren tweeted several attacks at the Republican Party in general before calling the idea of Pence being second in command ”terrifying.” ”Terrifying to think of @mike_pence being a heartbeat from presidency    but the direction @GOP wants to take our country is MORE terrifying,” she tweeted. Warren has regularly attacked Trump in recent months, at one point calling him a ”  racist bully.” Trump has fought back, mocking Warren’s claimed Native American heritage by calling her ”Pocahontas.”
