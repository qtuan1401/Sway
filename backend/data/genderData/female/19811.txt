WASHINGTON, DC  —   Republican South Carolina Rep. Trey Gowdy is going to support Donald Trump for president. [The Benghazi Commission chairman, who backed Marco Rubio, is not going to hitch his wagon to the dying #NeverTrump movement now that Trump is certainly going to be the Republican candidate in November.  “As Congressman Gowdy stated months ago, he will support the Republican nominee for President,” Gowdy spokeswoman Amanda Gonzalez said in a statement Friday. “He strongly supported Senator Marco Rubio until Rubio suspended his campaign. Now that Mr. Trump is the Republican nominee, Congressman Gowdy will support him,” Gonzalez added. Breitbart News reported on Gowdy’s efforts stumping for Rubio in Iowa before the caucus. Gowdy’s experience leading the Benghazi Commission could help Republican efforts this year to paint Clinton as a corrupt foreign policy insider, though the actual Commission did little to damage Clinton. House Freedom Caucus chairman Rep. Jim Jordan, who worked under Gowdy on the Benghazi Commission, led the way by saying that the party will “come together” behind Donald Trump in a Breitbart News interview earlier this week.
