On “Fox News Sunday With Chris Wallace,” conservative commentator George Will tied Republican presidential   Donald Trump to former Alabama Gov. George Wallace.  Will said, “Stylistically, Trump is in the George Wallace tradition. Who famously said there is too much dignity in American politics, we have to have more meanness. Wallace got 36 electoral votes because he is a regional candidate. What makes Trump more interesting is he has support all over the country. The problem is this, not only are his negative 61% almost doubled his positives, 32%. But he’s appealing entirely to white people. Now, in 1988, George Herbert Walker Bush got 59% of the white vote which is high. That translated in 426 electorate votes. Mitt Romney in 2012 got 59% of the white vote that, translated into 206 electoral votes. Romney got 17% that is all, of the nonwhite vote. Trump by every measure would do worse than that. Which means he would have to get not just the 65% of the white vote to win that Ronald Reagan got sweeping 49 states, he would have to get 70% of the white vote. A, it won’t happen and B, it would destroy the Republican party by making it the party of white people. ” Follow Pam Key on Twitter @pamkeyNEN
