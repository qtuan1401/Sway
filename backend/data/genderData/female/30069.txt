The Washington Examiner’s “Washington Secrets” columnist Paul Bedard reports on the conservative movement’s praise for   Donald Trump’s choice of Stephen K.

And that is good,” he said, also adding praise for Trump’s pick of Republican Party chief Reince Priebus as White House chief of staff. One of the nation’s preeminent biographers of Ronald Reagan, Craig Shirley, said, “Steve Bannon is a friend and a great patriot. He is at the vanguard of history and not the smear merchant bystanders of the corrupt liberal media. ” His colleague at the public affairs firm Shirley  Banister and the group Citizens for the Republic, Diana Banister, added, “Bravo Breitbart’s Steve Bannon, friend to the forgotten man, brilliant political strategist with the tenacity and genius to drain the swamp!” Read the rest here.
