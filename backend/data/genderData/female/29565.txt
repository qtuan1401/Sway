Donald Trump is responding to revelations that Hillary Clinton’s spokesperson allegedly urged and scripted the denial that Clinton sent any classified information via email on the private email server she used as secretary of state. [“WikiLeaks proves even the Clinton campaign knew Crooked mishandled classified info, but no one gets charged? RIGGED!” Trump posted on Twitter on Monday morning, sharing an article from Bloomberg, titled, “Clinton Aide Urged Denying Any Secrets Were Sent: WikiLeaks. ”  WikiLeaks proves even the Clinton campaign knew Crooked mishandled classified info, but no one gets charged? RIGGED! https:  .   —   Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) October 17, 2016,  “We should not think it is fine to find something that ‘should have been classified at the time,”’ Clinton’s spokesperson Brian Fallon wrote in an email on Aug. 22, 2015 to other campaign officials. “Our position is that no such material exists, else it could be said she mishandled classified info. ” Fallon’s email came as Clinton’s campaign staff members were debating how Clinton should address her use of a private email server. The email was discovered in the thousands of emails that were hacked from Clinton’s campaign chair John Podesta and posted by WikiLeaks. The Clinton campaign has neither admitted or denied whether the emails posted by WikiLeaks are authentic. “It wasn’t immediately clear when or if Clinton delivered the statement suggested by Fallon, which would have come after months of downplaying the issue. Four days after Fallon wrote the   Clinton said using the server ‘clearly wasn’t the best choice,’” Bloomberg reports. “I’m confident that this process will prove that I never sent nor received any   that was marked classified,” Clinton stated.
