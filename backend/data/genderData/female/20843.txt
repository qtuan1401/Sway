The CNN correspondent on the scene asked the couple whether they got along and asked both of them why they supported either candidate. After Jackie explained that she trusts Trump to be a strong leader and stop America from owing other countries, the reporter implied that she should support Clinton because of her gender. “Aren’t you excited for the first female president?” he asked. Krachala simply replied, “No!” Democratic presidential nominee Hillary Clinton leads Republican presidential nominee Donald Trump by three percentage points on Election Day, according to RealClearPolitics.
