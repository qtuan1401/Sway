’  ’ ’     Want to take a stand against Breitbart, the site     formerly headed by Trump adviser Steve Bannon that Bannon once     called “”?

Of them, Kellogg’s,     the company behind a dizzying array of breakfast and other     foods, has gotten the most attention. After the company removed     its advertising from Breitbart on Tuesday,     the site responded with a . “Boycotting     Breitbart News for presenting mainstream American ideas is an     act of discrimination and intense     prejudice,” Breitbart        Alexander Marlow . “If you     serve Kellogg’s products to your family, you are serving up     bigotry at your breakfast table. ” Naturally, this inspired a     liberal   to buy up Kellogg’s products:   ’ ” ’t’t’tOK, let’s get all these products sold out in California, Brooklyn, and the Upper West Side!  ” ’     Sleeping Giants’ approach here isn’t new, of course. Pressuring     advertisers to drop support for broadcasters or publishers is a       political strategy, one notably embraced in the     past by conservative groups like  and the  and coordinated     by phone or mail. But in coordinating online to attack digital     advertising, Sleeping Giants is taking a page from a group that     recently showed how easily a dedicated group can kneecap a     website’s support.   ’ ’     In 2014, angry members of the Gamergate movement went after     Gawker Media, including flagship     site Gawker, . Gamergate was spawned out of     a  over inaccurate     claims that a writer at the Gawker Media     site Kotaku had positively reviewed an indie     game by a developer he was dating. Incensed, Gamergate trolls     launched a vicious campaign against the developer and other     women that included violent threats and the leaking of personal     information.   ’ ’     After Gawker writer Sam Biddle  about the need to bully     Gamergate’s “nerds,” the movement’s troll army built a       effort around Gawker’s supposed endorsement of     bullying. “Your company is listed as an advertising affiliate     with Gawker,” one  sample email     read. “In light of Mr. Biddle’s comments, and     [Gawker editor Max Read’s] support of said     comments, I urge you to withdraw said advertising support from     Gawker and all its affiliates. This is National Bullying     Awareness Month, and these comments are unacceptable in a     society where several thousand people commit suicide each year     due to bullying. ”   ’ ’     Adobe and BMW were  among the     companies that pulled their campaigns from Gawker Media. So     damaging was the flight of advertisers that Read would     later  as one     potential culprit in the site’s demise.   ’ ’     The Gamergate campaign was at once more vitriolic and more     sophisticated than the Sleeping Giants effort seems to be. On     Reddit and elsewhere, Gamergaters hyperventilated over the     alleged malice of individual writers and compiled lists of PR     and marketing executives to contact. One Reddit     user that he’d spent more     than two hours constantly refreshing Gawker pages to put     together a more complete list of the site’s advertisers and had     even gone as far as using virtual private networks to simulate     visits from Romania so he could document foreign ads:   ’ ’     “What I’d missed about Gamergate,”  “was that     they were gamers —  they had spent years developing a tolerance     for highly repetitive tasks. ”   ’ ’     Sleeping Giants, by contrast, is more dependent on casual     participation. There’s no doggedly determined group       every appearance of a new ad     on Breitbart. Nor are Sleeping Giants’ protesters     acting out a personal vendetta; they’re driven by concern about     the racism, misogyny, and xenophobia on display     at Breitbart, a site with, for example, a “black     crime” vertical that once  Muslims in the     West a “ticking time bomb. ”   ’ ’     Yet the two campaigns share a basic core strategy. Targeting     advertisers —  the only major source of revenue available to most     online media —  is the surest way to bring a site to its knees. Ad     representatives, not terribly worried about the value of ads at     niche sites     like Breitbart and Gawker in     a world with millions of others to choose from, may well cave     to avoid the PR fallout of a viral effort. The losses incurred     by Gawker demonstrated that these kinds of     attacks can inflict real damage, even if they don’t ultimately     bring sites down. Breitbart’s own Allum Bokhari     wrote as much in the wake of the       campaign, in a rhapsodic piece     praising Gamergate for taking advantage of the influential     site’s inherent vulnerability:   ’ ’     Thanks to Sleeping Giants, perhaps a better underdog story has     arrived. But for better and worse, online activists have shown     just how easily the digital economy allows agitators to make     web publishers feel their pain.   ’
