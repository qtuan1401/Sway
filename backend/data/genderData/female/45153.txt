’ President Donald Trump may fire Robert Mueller, the       former FBI director who is now in charge of the         investigation. ’ ’   President Donald Trump may consider firing Robert Mueller, the   special counsel overseeing the Russia investigation. ’ ’   ”He’’s weighing that option,” said Chris Ruddy, Newsmax CEO and   friend of Trump on PBS NewsHour Monday evening. ”I personally   think it would be a very significant mistake  —   even though I   don’’t think there’’s a justification . .. for a special counsel in   this case,” Ruddy said. ’ ’   Ruddy  on Monday, but it was not   immediately clear whether the subject of Mueller came up during   his visit. ’ ’   In the interview with PBS, Ruddy called out what he described as   ”conflicts” surrounding Mueller’’s law firm, WilmerHale, which has   represented Trump’’s former campaign manager and members of the   Trump family. Ruddy also said Trump had interviewed Mueller for   the role of FBI director before Mueller was named special counsel   in charge of the Russia investigation. ’ ’   White House Press Secretary Sean Spicer said in an email to   Business Insider Monday night: ”Mr. Ruddy never spoke to the   President regarding this issue. With respect to this subject,   only the President or his attorneys are authorized to comment.” ’ ’  ’ ’   In the last 36 hours, people in Trump’’s orbit have floated   conflicting narratives on the matter. A lawyer for Trump  Sunday that he is ”not going to speculate”   about whether Trump may fire Mueller. But Trump’’s conservative   allies  despite initially   praising his appointment. ’ ”   Trump’s allies now claim the results Mueller comes up with in the   investigation into whether Trump campaign associates colluded   with Russian officials during the 2016 election will be tainted   and biased, Business Insider’s Allan Smith reported earlier   Tuesday, due in part to former FBI director James Comey’s Senate   testimony last week. ” ’  ’ ”   At his hearing before the Senate Intelligence Committee on   Thursday, Comey said that he gave a friend, a Columbia law   professor, permission to share with news outlets Comey’s memos   documenting private meetings he had with Trump. ” ”   Comey testified that he believed the revelations in his memos  —     including concern that Trump sought to influence the FBI’s Russia   investigation  —   would prompt the appointment of a special   counsel. ” ’   While Trump as president would be within his right to fire   Mueller, that potential move is largely seen as problematic for a   president already plagued by suggestions he have overstepped his   boundaries in his interactions with Comey. ’ ’   Rep. Adam Schiff, ranking member of the House Intelligence   Committee attempted to  of Trump firing Mueller. ’ ’   ”If President fired Bob Mueller, Congress would immediately     independent counsel and appoint Bob Mueller. Don’’t   waste our time,” Schiff said. It is unclear, however, exactly how   the   Congress would react to Mueller’’s firing, if   it were to happen. ’ ’   Richard Painter, who served as top White House ethics lawyer   under George W. Bush, offered an unvarnished take on the   rumblings Monday night. ’ ’   ”Rumors going around that POTUS wants to fire Mueller,” he said.   ”That had better be fake news or this presidency will be over   very soon.” ’ ’President Donald Trump may fire Robert Mueller. ..’ ’’ ’’ ’’
