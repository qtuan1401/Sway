In a Saturday conversation with The Daily Beast contributor Wayne Barrett about his article on the FBI’s ties to GOP presidential nominee Donald Trump, MSNBC’s Joy Reid said there seems to be a “culture of Trumpism” and “Trumpist attitude” towards the Clintons in the FBI.  “It does seem from the story that you wrote that there is a culture of Trumpism within the FBI. To what do you attribute what appears to be, particularly in the New York office, a sort of Trumpist attitude toward the Clintons?” she asked Barrett on her MSNBC show “AM Joy. ” Barrett responded by saying there is “certainly”   going on in the New York FBI office.
