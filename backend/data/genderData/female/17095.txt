Presumptive Republican nominee Donald Trump filed his Personal Financial Disclosure (PFD) forms on Monday with the Federal Election Commission (FEC). This is the real estate mogul’s second annual filing, according to his campaign press release. [“I filed my PFD, which I am proud to say is the largest in the history of the FEC,” Trump stated in his campaign press release. “Despite the fact that I am allowed extensions, I have again filed my report, which is 104 pages, on time. Bernie Sanders has requested, on the other hand, an extension for his small report. ”  Trump went on: This is the difference between a businessman and the     politicians that have failed the American people for far too long. I have built an incredible company and have accumulated one of the greatest portfolios of real estate assets, many of which are considered to be among the finest and most iconic properties in the world. This is the kind of thinking the country needs. The newly filed PFD shows a tremendous cash flow, and a revenue increase of approximately $190 million dollars (which does not include dividends, interest, capital gains, rents and royalties). This income was utilized, among other things, for the funding of construction projects at various   dollar developments, reduction of debt and the funding of the campaign. The press release adds that Trump’s net worth is more than $10 billion dollars and his income is reportedly “in excess of $557 million (which does not include dividends, interest, capital gains, rents and royalties). ”
