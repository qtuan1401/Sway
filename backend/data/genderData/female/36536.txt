Washington (CNN) GOP vice presidential nominee Mike Pence will not attend the summer donor summit organized by Charles and David Koch, now unable to commit to an event after he was added to the ticket with Donald Trump, Pence, a Koch favorite, had originally committed to attending this weekend’s event, where hundreds of   Republican donors    including many Trump skeptics    will gather. A spokesman for the Indiana governor said that he will now no longer attend. ”When he was governor, he was committed,” Marc Lotter said Monday. ”Since we can’t give them a 100% commitment to say yes, it would be inappropriate to leave them hanging.” Pence is currently barnstorming the country alongside Trump, and party bundlers are expecting to him take on an aggressive fundraising schedule in the near term. The network of organizations funded by the Kochs and their associates are currently not spending their fortunes on the Republican nominee, and Koch officials have said that Pence’s place on the ticket is not changing their posture.  Pence, an accomplished fundraiser, has several prominent donor and operative connections to the Koch network, and he has made multiple appearances at their events.
