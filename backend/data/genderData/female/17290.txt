Former Mexican President Vicente Fox doubled down on not paying for the wall along the southern border that presumptive GOP nominee Donald Trump proposed and also said he won’t have lunch with Trump unless the billionaire apologizes for language he’s used about Mexico. [“Now he invited me for lunch. He sends me a message saying, ‘Come and I invite you for lunch in New York,’” Fox stated on Friday during an interview on CNN. “I will come if at first you apologize to Mexico, to Mexicans, to Mexican people. And number 2, you apologize to U. S. workers, because you’re not telling them the truth. ”  “Sounds like you don’t want to have lunch with Donald Trump,” CNN’s Chris Cuomo replied. “Well, I can have it in San Cristobal at my place,” Fox responded. Fox began the interview, saying, “Thank you for the invitation. I’m not paying for that wall. ” He also criticized Trump for tweeting that the EgyptAir Flight 804, which was reported missing until crash remains were later discovered, looked like an act of terrorism. “The guy that has a very short short fuse is him. Just look at his reaction yesterday about this horrible plane crash or bomb or whatever it was,” Fox stated about Trump. “First message should be of solidarity, of compassion to the people, the families of the people that was in that plane. That’s where you start always,” Fox criticized. “You don’t go to war with everybody. You don’t go and hate everybody. You don’t see everyone as an enemy. ”
