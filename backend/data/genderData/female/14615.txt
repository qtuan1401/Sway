The Italian designers behind one of Melania Trump’s favorite brands, Dolce  Gabbana, have launched a fashion campaign that seems to mock critics who continue to demand they stop dressing the First Lady. [After collaborating with Melania on a number of high fashion looks for her first trip abroad with President Trump, as Big Hollywood chronicled, Dolce  Gabbana are proudly blasting their critics by launching their own “#Boycott Dolce  Gabbana” campaign.  In a fashion film for the new line of “#Boycott”   by Stefano Gabbana and Domenico Dolce, Italian models can be seen waving protest flags while donning the shirts, which showcase a large, red heart. During one segment of the film, Gabbana, the Italian fashion house’s most prominent supporter of Melania, is seen being interviewed by the press. The new Dolce  Gabbana merchandise and fashion film comes after Stefano openly blasted his critics on Instagram following a barrage of attacks on the designers intended to get them to stop dressing the First Lady. In one Instagram post showing Melania wearing   Dolce  Gabbana to visit the Vatican in Italy, Gabbana hinted at the upcoming #Boycott campaign, writing “THANK YOU ❤ Haters! !!! Remember #boycottdolcegabbana please  …    ”  @flotus ❤❤❤❤ #melaniatrump ❤❤#DGWoman THANK YOU ❤  Haters! !!!

Back in 2015, the legendary gay designers made clear their traditional views, voicing their opposition to gay marriage and gay adoption, shooting down the notion that they would eventually get married. “The only family is the traditional one,” the duo said in the interview. “No chemical offspring and rented uterus. Life has a natural flow there are things that cannot be changed. ” Following the interview, the gay Italian establishment demanded they be boycotted while fashion columnists and critics denounced their views.
