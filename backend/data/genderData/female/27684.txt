Former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton confirms that she feels emotion when she thinks about becoming the first woman nominee for president. [“Do you feel the weight of what this means for people?” asked one reporter on the campaign trail on Monday.  “I do. I do,” she said, praising her supporters for being “passionate” and “committed” to her victory. “It’s really emotional,” she said. “I am someone who has been very touched and really encouraged by this extraordinary conviction that people have. ” She said the emotion came from “predominantly women and girls” but that men had been bringing their daughters to her campaign events to witness history. “I do think that it will make a very big difference for a father or a mother to be able to look at their daughter just like they can look at their son and say ‘You can be anything you want to be in this country, including president of the United States. ”
