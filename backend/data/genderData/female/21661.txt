Glenn Beck lit into former Alaska governor Sarah Palin after her endorsement today of GOP presidential frontrunner Donald Trump. The radio host then announced that he would be joining Sen. Ted Cruz this weekend for a campaign rally in Waterloo, Iowa. [Beck, who had a falling out with Palin a number of years ago that only became public last fall when he referred to her as a “clown” on his radio show, posted the following to his Facebook page today:  Sarah Palin. Small Government, lower taxes, fewer regulations and the constitution? Not any more. Big government, bailouts, executive orders, not just abortion but partial birth abortion, nationalizing of banks, stimulus, pathway to citizenship. All of these views were held by Donald Trump during this administration. Pathway to citizenship in 2013. Some as recently as last year. What was the massive pivot point to make him change so fundamentally? When Sarah and the tea party won a hard fought election and were under attack in 2010, DJT was giving money to Pelosi, Reid and Rahm. I couldn’t disagree with her more but she has played the game now for years. Perhaps she knows more than those of us still on the outside. Maybe the press was right about her but for all of the wrong reasons. Shortly after posting this, Beck announced on Facebook that he and his wife Tania would be joining Ted Cruz for a rally in Waterloo, Iowa, this weekend. “Hope to see you there as I lend my support to help defend the constitution, a small government crusader and an authentic conservative Christian candidate,” Beck wrote in reference to Cruz. Beck and Cruz had previously worked together for a border relief effort in 2014 to bring soccer balls, teddy bears, and other humanitarian aid to illegal immigrant children.
