MSNBC Political Analyst Joan Walsh argued that while GOP presidential candidate Donald Trump is taking from the “toxic bog of   hate” by referencing the sexual assault allegations against Bill Clinton, “the Clinton campaign is somewhat worried about it” and it “could hurt” Hillary on Thursday’s broadcast of MSNBC’s “The Last Word. ”  Walsh said, “I think it will eventually peter out, but I think that the Clinton campaign is somewhat worried about it. Although I have to say, the smooth move of the day on Instagram, was that her campaign did a Throwback Thursday photo, a wedding photo of Bill and Hillary looking very much in love. So, that to me was a kind of stick in your eye. But you know, I think they’re trying to play against  —   this  —   one of these things started with Hillary Clinton saying we should believe rape victims.   …     And she was then assaulted by Republicans and others. Donald Trump has now taken this out of the kind of toxic bog of   hate, where all of these allegations, they never died. We think it was litigated 20 years ago. I’m feeling a lot younger this week, I don’t know about you, Lawrence, because we’re back in the ’90s. Which  —   I loved the ’90s, but it’s dangerous, because it wasn’t litigated for   and   who don’t necessarily remember it, and are hearing some of this for the first time. So, it  —   this could hurt her. It’s kind of like he’s doing with [Republican presidential candidate Sen.] Ted Cruz ( ) he’s creating this weird  —   he’s a gremlin, and creating this weird world of doubt, and forcing people to respond to things they would really rather not talk about right now. ” (  Real Clear Politics) Follow Ian Hanchett on Twitter @IanHanchett
