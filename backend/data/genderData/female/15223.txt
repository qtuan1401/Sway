The national   movement has experienced multiple successes in 2016. Ten of the major highlights of the past year are especially noteworthy. [“These laws not only protect unborn babies but serve to educate the public about the brutality of abortion,” says National Right to Life about the bans on dismemberment abortions.  “In a moment that was even cringe worthy for Democrats, Clinton reaffirmed her support for the   abortion method and abortions throughout all nine months of pregnancy,” observed National Right to Life. “By contrast, Trump said, ‘I am   and I will be appointing   judges. ’” Kristan Hawkins, president of Students for Life of America, said, despite Obama’s veto, Congress’ use of the reconciliation process to redirect funds from Planned Parenthood  —   “a likely criminal organization”  —   to other healthcare facilities is “historic. ” “This veto  —   only one of eight bills that Obama has vetoed and the very first   one  —   underscores the need for the nation to elect a   president in 2016,” she added, “one who does the will of the people instead of pandering to a corrupt and deceitful organization that betrays women and sells them, and their preborn babies, out for the bottom line. ” “There is no member of Congress in recent memory who did greater harm to a major piece of   legislation, while claiming to be   than Renee Ellmers,” said Douglas Johnson, director of federal legislation for National Right to Life.
