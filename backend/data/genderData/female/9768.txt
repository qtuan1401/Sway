We’re going to be working for you, and we’re going to be producing results. “Now the work begins,” he said at his second speech, given at the Freedom Ball.  “We did a good job together   …     there has never been a movement like this anywhere in the world,” he told his enthusiastic supporters.  “We will not be taken advantage of anymore.
