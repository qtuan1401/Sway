’  ’ ’     Md. (Reuters)        ’ ’   A judge in Maryland said he also might issue an emergency order   on Wednesday in advance of the ban. ’ ’   State attorneys general and refugee resettlement agencies across   the United States have filed several lawsuits asking courts to   issue emergency stays on Trump’s executive order. ’ ’   The order was signed on March 6 after an initial, broader ban was   suspended by federal courts. ’ ’   The revised order temporarily bars entry to the United States of   most refugees as well as travelers from six     countries. The Republican president has said the policy is   critical for national security. ’ ’   The federal judges at three hearings on Wednesday strongly   questioned lawyers for both the administration and its critics,   pressing on the question of who specifically would be harmed by   the revamped executive order. ’ ’   Trump signed the first order a week after his Jan. 20   inauguration. It temporarily banned travelers from seven mostly   Muslim countries in addition to most refugees and took effect   immediately, causing chaos and protests at airports across the   country and around the globe. ’ ’   After the ban was targeted by more than two dozen lawsuits   arguing it discriminated against Muslims and violated the US   Constitution, it was struck down by a federal judge in Seattle in   a ruling upheld by a US appeals court. ’ ’   The White House went back to the drawing board and narrowed its   scope. ’ ’   The new order bars citizens of Iran, Libya, Syria, Somalia, Sudan   and Yemen from entering the country for 90 days, but Iraq is no   longer on the list. Refugees are still barred for 120 days, but   an indefinite ban on all refugees from Syria was dropped. ’ ’   The revised ban also excludes legal permanent residents and   existing visa holders. It provides a series of waivers for   various categories of immigrants with ties to the United States.   The government has maintained in court that the changes resolve   any legal issues with the original order. ’ ’  ’ ’   Three cases against the new ban moved forward on Wednesday. ’ ’   In Maryland, refugee resettlement agencies represented by the   American Civil Liberties Union and the National Immigration Law   Center argued in court for a restraining order. ’ ”   Separately, Hawaii’s attorney general sued, arguing the states’   universities and tourist economy would be harmed by the travel   restrictions and also asked that the law be enjoined. ” ’   In Washington state, a group of plaintiffs applying for immigrant   visas asked US District Judge James Robart in Seattle   who   suspended the first ban   to stop the new order. ’ ’   Washington state, joined by California, Maryland, Massachusetts,   New York and Oregon, said in court filings they supported the   plaintiffs in Seattle. ’ ’   To move forward with the lawsuits, the states and groups have to   prove harm, or ”standing,” which some legal experts have said is   difficult to prove because of all the exemptions and waivers in   the new order. ’ ’   The government says the new order only applies to people outside   the United States who have not entered the country and do not   have constitutional rights. ’ ’   ”Who has the standing in this case if anyone?” US District Judge   Derrick Watson asked Hawaii’’s attorneys. ’ ’   A group of 58 tech companies, including Airbnb, Lyft and Dropbox,   filed a ”friend of the court’’ brief in the case saying the order   hurt their ability to recruit the best talent from around the   world. A longer list of companies   that included giants like   Apple, Facebook and Google   filed a brief opposing the first ban   in a different court challenge brought by Washington state, which   is ongoing. ’ ’   At the court hearing in Greenbelt, Maryland, on Wednesday US   District Judge Theodore Chuang pushed on the question of who   would be harmed by the order. Chuang said he would try to issue a   written ruling on Wednesday, before the order is implemented, but   said it might come afterward. ’ ’  ’ ”   Detractors say the intent behind both Trump’s first and second   orders was to discriminate against Muslims. ” ’   Colleen Sinzdak arguing at the Honolulu hearing for the state of   Hawaii said there was ”more than ample evidence this ban was   motivated by religious animus.” She pointed to Trump’’s promise   during his election campaign of ”a total and complete shutdown of   Muslims entering the United States.” ’ ’   The Trump administration has disputed that allegation, saying   many   countries are not included in the ban. ’ ’   The text of the order does not mention Islam and the government   has said the courts should only look at the actual document, not   outside comments by Trump or his aides. ’ ’   The judge at the Hawaii hearing said the language of the new   order did not give ”any particular religious feeling or   connotation.” ’ ’   If the new ban goes ahead, advocacy groups said lawyers would   head again to international airports to assist anyone who might   be improperly detained or prevented from entering, said Betsy   Fisher, the policy director at the International Refugee   Assistance Project. ’ ’   Since the order included a   lag before taking effect, far   fewer people are likely to be caught out while traveling. ’ ’   ”There are going to be attorneys on the ground and ready to   respond,” Fisher said in a telephone interview. ”But we’’re   anticipating not seeing the same kind of chaos because there was   an announcement in advance.” ’ ’   (Reporting by Dan Levine in Honolulu and Ian Simpson in   Greenbelt, Md.
