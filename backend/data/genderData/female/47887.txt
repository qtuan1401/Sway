’  ’ ’   New York Gov. Andrew Cuomo ripped Donald Trump for his campaign   slogan on the final day of the Democratic National Convention in   Philadelphia. ’ ’   Many speakers have taken aim at the Republican nominee’’s slogan  —     ”Make America Great Again”  —   but Cuomo deconstructed the phrase   in a way not seen so far in the convention: ’ ”   Cuomo’s critique echoed those made by other speakers this week,   including President Barack Obama. ” ’’ ’   ”America is already great. America is already strong,” Obama said    on Wednesday night. ”And I promise you, our   strength, our greatness, does not depend on Donald Trump.” ’ ’   Cuomo also acknowledged his father, former New York Gov. Mario   Cuomo, who died last year. The elder Cuomo gave the  at the 1984 Democratic convention, and ”he loved the   Democratic Party,” Andrew Cuomo said. ’
