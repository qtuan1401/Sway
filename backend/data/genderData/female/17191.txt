Monday on MSNBC’s special primary coverage, Rep. Steve King ( ) a supporter of Republican presidential hopeful Sen. Ted Cruz ( ) responded to Donald Trump calling Cruz a “liar. ”  King said, “This is just  —   it is the sickening display of a school yard bully. We’ve never seen this in politics before. I notice that somebody tallied up in the debate Saturday night that the word ‘liar’ was used 22 times. We don’t use that word where I come from, because when you make that kind of allegation, we look back at our founding fathers, for example, and realize that Aaron Burr and Alexander Hamilton fought a duel to the death over such allegations, and now we have them hurled out as if making that allegation somehow makes it true and makes it stick.  I will say this. The things I heard Donald Trump say, you would never want a president of the United States speaking like that from the podium. Think of this press conference he just did. Think of the great seal of the United States of America in front of him. The president of the United States hurling those baseless accusations out, attacking people, attacking their character   calling them liars with no basis or substance. An by the way, he’s not even being held accountable by the press  …    You have to go to the original source of the text, run the tape and tell me what wasn’t true. I don’t know of a single thing that Ted Cruz said that wasn’t objectively true and precisely stated. ”
