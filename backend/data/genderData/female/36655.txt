Colorado Springs (CNN) Charles Koch, frustrated by questions about whether he could support Democrat Hillary Clinton in the presidential race, on Sunday deemed that idea a ”blood libel.” Koch, speaking halfway through his biannual donor summit at the Broadmoor resort, has long said he will not support Republican Donald Trump in November. But the billionaire    and conservative megadonor    has not said explicitly who he will vote for. And in April, when asked on ABC’s ”This Week” if he could support Clinton over Trump, he had said: ”It’s possible.” Yet Koch made clear to his donors here that a Clinton vote was not on the agenda. ”The first thing I want to do is correct the rumor that the media keeps stipulating    and that is that I’m going to probably support Hillary,” Koch said to laughs. ”That is a blood libel.” ”At this point, I can’t support either candidate, but I’m certainly not going to support Hillary,” he said. Koch’s network is under significant pressure from some donors to back Trump in November. Yet his aides announced this week that they would not fund   ads, solidifying their reluctance to play presidential politics in 2016.
