Hillary Clinton reacted angrily to Donald Trump’s press conference with military veterans on Friday, calling his actions “disgraceful. ”[“Trump’s actions today were disgraceful,” Clinton said in a statement. “After five years of pushing a racist conspiracy theory into the mainstream, it was appalling to watch Trump appoint himself the judge of whether the President of the United States is American. ”  The Trump campaign said that Republican presidential nominee would address questions about the President Obama “birther” storyline at the campaign event, but he waited until his veterans supporters finished speaking before making a statement. “President Barack Obama was born in the United States, period,” Trump said. “Now we all want to get back to making America strong and great again. ” But Clinton was not pleased by Trump’s handling of the situation. “This sickening display shows more than ever why Donald Trump is totally unfit be president,” she said.
