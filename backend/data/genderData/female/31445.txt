Monday on “CNN Newsroom,” Republican presidential candidate Sen. Rand Paul ( ) said he is worried because his opponent Donald Trump’s “narcissism” and “delusions of grandeur” now have him “saying he can shoot people and people will still vote for him. ”  Paul said, “We also joke that we have our own airline also, it just doesn’t have my name on it, has Southwest on the side of it. No I think a dose of humility might be good. I am worried that his narcissism exceeds nothing and that his delusions of grandeur have him saying he can shoot people and people will still vote for him. I hope that’s not true. ” He added, “A lot of us still think Trump has a lot of work to convince conservatives that he is for smaller government. What I hear coming from Trump is trust him he is rich and smart and will take care of us. A lot of us believe that power corrupts and we don’t want anyone to have too much power either a Democrat or Republican because we think power has a corrupting influence. We love the fact that our founding fathers bound up the constitution and said you can’t do certain things. ” Follow Pam Key on Twitter @pamkeyNEN
