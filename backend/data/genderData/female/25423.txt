Ahead of Florida primary, Rubio offers Trump a tepid embrace: https:  .  @mkraju reports. https:  .  In an interview that aired on CNN’s “New Day” on Tuesday, Sen. Marco Rubio ( ) seemingly dismissed Republican presidential nominee Donald Trump’s charge that Trump’s opponent Democratic presidential nominee Hillary Clinton was a bigot.  The junior Florida U. S. Senator who is up for reelection in the fall noted that Democrats have a track record of calling Republican “bigots. ” “Democrats have been calling Republicans bigoted for a long time,” Rubio said. “I think Hillary Clinton has a lot of problems. I think she is corrupt. She is dishonest. Do I think some of the policies she stands for do harm minority communities? Absolutely. ” “You’ll have to ask some of the other campaigns about the terms they use,” he added. “I can tell you I don’t want Hillary Clinton to be our president. ” Follow Jeff Poor on Twitter @jeff_poor
