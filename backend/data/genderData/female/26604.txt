On Sunday’s broadcast of NBC’s “Meet the Press,” presumptive Republican presidential nominee Donald Trump said he can win the presidency with or without the support of the Republican establishment.  Trump said, “I think we’re going to have a great convention, and we’re going to go on to a great victory. It would be nice if the Republicans stuck together. But I think because I’m a different kind of candidate, and Paul Ryan said that, I’m a different kind of a candidate. I think I can win either way. I can win one way or the other. ” He added, “I think I can, because I obviously won the primaries without them. I’m an outsider and I won the primaries. I do believe we can win either way, but it would be nice if we stuck together. ” Follow Pam Key on Twitter @pamkeyNEN
