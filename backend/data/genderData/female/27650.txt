Sunday on NBC’s “Meet the Press,” Sennate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell ( ) said he is concerned about Republican presidential nominee Donald Trump’s effect on the Hispanic vote.  Partial transcript as follows: TODD: In your book, you spend a lot of time talking about your mentor in the senate and how he stood up against Barry Goldwater. You voted for LBJ. He went ahead and supported the Civil Rights Act. You worry that Barry Goldwater would leave a stain on the party. Are you worried Donald Trump is going to leave a stain on the party the way Goldwater did?” MCCONNELL: “I am concerned about the Hispanic vote. America is changing. When Ronald Reagan was elected 84 percent of the electorate was white. This November, 70 percent will be. It’s a big mistake for our party to write off Latino Americans. They’re an important part of the country and soon to be the largest minority group in the country. Am I concerned about that. I hope he’ll change his direction on that. ” Follow Pam Key on Twitter @pamkeyNEN
