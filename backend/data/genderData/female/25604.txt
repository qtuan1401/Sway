  Donald Trump debuted a new hat over the weekend, previewing his upcoming inauguration as the 45th president of the United States. [The hat was spotted by reporters who watched Trump leave his    hotel on Sunday afternoon and left for the airport back to New York City.  The hat read “USA” on the front with the number “45” on the side. A photo of the hat was captured by Reuters and was shared online by Trump fans. Gotta love @realDonaldTrump new hat.
