The two leaders also discussed the crisis in Syria and other regional issues,” a White House statement read. “The United States and Israel stand together facing a range of challenges, and the two leaders pledged to deepen cooperation to bring greater peace and stability to the Middle East and to protect the United States, Israel and other nations from the global threat of terrorism,” the statement concluded.
