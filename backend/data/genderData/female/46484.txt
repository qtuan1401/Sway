’’ ’Retired neurosurgeon Ben Carson on Thursday briefly left CNN anchors John Berman and Kate Bolduan speechless when he suggested Berman had ”probably been charged” with a crime.’ ”Berman had asked the Donald Trump surrogate to justify the continued employment of Trump’s campaign manager, who has been  with misdemeanor battery.” ”Berman asked Carson if Corey Lewandowski should remain in charge of the Trump campaign in light of his arrest for allegedly grabbing the arm of a former Breitbart News reporter. He noted many people cited Lewandowski’s battery as a credible reason to dismiss the top aide.” ’”Well, I mean, a lot of people have been charged with various things,” Carson responded. ”That doesn’’t necessarily mean we need to demonize them. You’’ve probably been charged with something too, maybe with a misdemeanor or something. It doesn’’t mean you’’re an evil, horrible person. ”’ ’Bolduan and Berman looked at each other with disbelief for a few seconds after Carson suggested Berman had a criminal record.’ ’”I actually haven’’t, as far as I know,” Berman then chimed in as Carson continued to talk over him.’ ’Watch below:’ ’’ ’Retired neurosurgeon Ben Carson on Thursday. ..’
