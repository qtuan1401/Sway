Monday on Fox News Channel’s “You World,” Milwaukee Co. WI Sheriff David Clarke weighed in on the “diversity coalition” Republican presidential   Donald Trump hosted earlier in the day at Trump Tower in New York City.  One of Clarke’s takeaways was that it was better than “groveling at the altar of Al Sharpton. ” “Look, there is a diversity of thought that is growing within the black community across the United States,” Clarke said. “It’s small right now. Many are afraid to come out and state how they really feel because of the backlash. They see that I left the plantation. I think for myself and they see what happens to me. So I think it’s going to take a little time. But I tell you what  —   I’m glad to see that Donald Trump did not go groveling at the altar of Al Sharpton and pandering to him trying to get the black vote, or trying to figure out what’s going on in the black community from that charlatan. ” Follow Jeff Poor on Twitter @jeff_poor
