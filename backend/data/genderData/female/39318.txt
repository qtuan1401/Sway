 (CNN) Donald Trump praised the spirit of the US Army and Navy football players Saturday while also reflecting on his upcoming role as Commander in Chief. ”I love the Armed Forces, love the folks. The spirit is so incredible. I don’t know if it’s necessarily the best football but it’s very good,” he told legendary CBS announcer Verne Lundquist at MT Bank Stadium in Baltimore, where the annual game between the two higher education institutions was held. ”But boy, do they have spirit, more than anybody. It’s beautiful to see. And the spirit. You don’t see this at any game.” ”I go to many games,” Trump added. ”You don’t see this kind of spirit anywhere. These are amazing people.” Trump took a moment during his halftime interview to reflect on heading to the White House in a matter of weeks.  ”It’s humbling. It’s a great honor, but it’s a great responsibility,” he said. ”And when you see these incredible people, we just want to be strong    and they want to be strong.” Former New York Mayor Rudy Giuliani, who the Trump campaign recently announced would not be a member of his incoming Cabinet, and Kansas Rep. Mike Pompeo, who Trump picked to head the CIA, joined the real estate mogul at the game. Army vs. Navy: Can the Black Knights end the streak?
