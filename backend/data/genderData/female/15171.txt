We have to keep in mind that Muslim friends  fam will be dealing with extra hate because of this,  —   Lucas Meadows (@lmeadows) May 23, 2017,  Some immediately jumped to blaming President Donald Trump: After   the US military terrorized the Middle East. Manchester may give Trump an excuse to do similar mayhem. Why is that hard to see?  —   Lucas Meadows (@lmeadows) May 23, 2017,  While some warned people away from blaming Islam for fear of angering more Muslims: @SaveUSA1776 I have a good idea. Let’s piss off more Muslims with mindless Islamophobia. That should help.  —   TheBardAsPundit (@jesswinfield) May 23, 2017,  Check Breitbart’s continuous coverage of the attack here.
