Friday on ABC’s “Good Morning America,” reporter Tom Llamas covered the attacks on Trump supporters outside of Republican presidential nominee Donald Trump’s rally in San Jose, CA last night.  Llamas said the   mob was not protests but “pure attacks” on Trump supporters “men, woman and even the elderly” attempting to leave the rally. He continued, “Overnight,   brawls outside the Trump rally in San Jose, CA. Trump supporters harassed, beaten and bloodied by mobs of protesters. ” He added, “Many of the people we saw were young men and young woman who were here to do only one thing which was throw punches. One more than one occasion we did see young people throwing up gang signs in those mobs of protesters. ” Follow Pam Key on Twitter @pamkeyNEN
