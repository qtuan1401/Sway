  Donald Trump didn’t rule out allowing the investigation of Hillary Clinton to continue, but signaled that he would rather move forward, than revisit her crimes. [“I’m not looking to go back through this,” he explained to reporters at the New York Times offices on Tuesday.  When asked if he was taking prosecution off of the table, Trump said “no,” but he appeared eager to move on. “My inclination would be for whatever power I have on the matter is to say let’s go forward,” he said. “This has been looked at for so long, ad nauseum.“ Trump argued against prosecuting the Clintons, suggesting that it would be better for the country and his administration if they moved on. “I think it would be very, very divisive for the country,” he said. Trump appeared to show sympathy for the Clintons, and even suggested that their foundation did good work around the world. “I don’t want to hurt the Clintons, I really don’t,” he said. “She went through a lot and suffered greatly in many different ways. ” When asked if his supporters would be disappointed by the news, Trump argued that they would likely understand. “I think I will explain it that we in many ways will save our country,” he said.
