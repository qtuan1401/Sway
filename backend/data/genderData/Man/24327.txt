Thursday in Japan at the   meeting, President Barack Obama said world leaders are “rattled” by the presumptive Republican presidential nominee Donald Trump because Obama said Trump seems more interested “in getting tweets and headlines instead of actually thinking through what it is that is required to keep America safe. ”  When asked about world leaders reaction to Trump, Obama said, “They are paying very close attention to this election. I think it’s fair to say they are surprised by the Republican nominee They are not sure how seriously to take some of his pronouncements. But they are rattled by it  —   and for good reason. Because a lot of the proposals he has made display either ignorance of world affairs, or a cavalier attitude, or an interest in getting tweets and headlines instead of actually thinking through what it is that is required to keep America safe and secure and prosperous. ” Follow Pam Key on Twitter @pamkeyNEN
