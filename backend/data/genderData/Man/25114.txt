[A Zogby Analytics survey that was published on Tuesday shows the New Yorker just behind the former secretary of state by two points, 38 percent to 36 percent.  “It seems the convention bumps are behind us and we are back to a close race!” the survey analysis suggests. “What’s new in the online poll is that older millennials are starting to trend to Trump,” reports Washington Examiners’ Paul Bedard. The survey shows Clinton leads with women, blacks, and Hispanics as well as middle income voters. Trump is leading with older voters, men and Independents. The survey, which was conducted August 12 to August 13, has a margin of error of plus or minus 2. 8 percent.
