’  ’ ’   Former secretary of state Colin Powell is no fan of Donald Trump. ’ ’   In a slew of emails obtained by  Powell tore into the Republican presidential   candidate referring to him as an “international pariah” and a   “national disgrace. ” ’ ’   In one email, Powell denounced Trump for perpetuating the   “racist” birther movement that questioned President Barack   Obama’s US citizenship. ’ ”   “Yup, the whole birther movement was racist,” Powell wrote,   according to the BuzzFeed News report. “That’s what the 99%   believe. When Trump couldn’t keep that up he said he also wanted   to see if the certificate noted that he was a Muslim. ” ” ’   In another exchange, Powell went off on media  —   echoing the   position of other lawmakers who believe the press helped fuel   Trump’s rise. ’ ’’ ’   “You guys are playing his game, you are his oxygen,” he said.   ”[Trump] outraged us again today with his comments on Paris     for police districts. I will watch and pick the timing, not   respond to the latest outrage   …    ” ’ ”   The   mogul’s controversial White House run has been   unlike any other in modern history. Many of the campaign’s highs   and lows have been covered from every angle  —     —   who   often rails against the coverage while simultaneously generating   new headlines. ” ’   When Trump  Powell reacted saying, ”Trump has no sense of   shame.” ’ ’   The retired   general said he was strategic about   publicly criticizing the brash billionaire in order no to entice   him. ’ ’   “To go on and call him an idiot just emboldens him,” Powell   wrote. ’ ”   Powell has also been critical of Hillary Clinton’s   campaign claim that he mentioned his use of a private   email server during his tenure as secretary of state in an   email.   ” ”   Clinton’s campaign has wrestled with the controversey over her   own use of a private email server while she was in the state   department.  ” ’  ’
