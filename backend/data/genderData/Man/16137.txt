Republican voters are very aware of the released video of Donald Trump making lewd comments about women, but a majority of them are willing to stand by their Republican nominee, according to a new   Consult poll.[  percent of Republicans think that party leaders should stand behind Trump, while 13 percent think they should abandon him.  A huge majority of Americans are aware of the video (79 percent) and agree that it makes Trump look bad, (74 percent) but they don’t think it’s enough to kick him to the curb.   percent of all voters think that Trump should not drop out of the presidential race, while 39 percent think he should drop out  —   a six point margin.    Trump’s apology video, aired late Friday night, appears to have stemmed some of the negative fallout.   percent of Republicans reacted favorably to the apology as well as 35 percent of independents.   percent of voters also agree with Trump that Bill Clinton has abused women and that Hillary Clinton has bullied, attacked, shamed and intimidated his victims, while only 33 percent believe that to be false. (  percent said they didn’t know or had no opinion.) The   Consult poll was conducted October 8 with 1, 549 registered voters and has a margin of error of plus or minus three points.
