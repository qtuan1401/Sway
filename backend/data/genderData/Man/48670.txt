’  ’ ’   Donald Trump recently . And he   used the first presidential debate on Monday night to hammer home   his point. ’ ’   ”In New York City,    we had 2, 200 murders, and      brought it down to 500 murders,” Trump said. ’ ’   He continued: ’ ”   But a look at the statistics casts doubt on most of these claims,   especially Trump’s praise of    a policing tactic in   which officers can search anyone on the street that many today   consider unconstitutional and ineffective. ” ”   Let’s start with the    between Trump and Clinton on   whether crime in New York City has increased or decreased under   Mayor Bill de Blasio: ” ”   There has been a slight increase in    murders since   2013, when de Blasio was elected. According to the New York City   Police Department’s crime statistics database,  the city experienced 243 murders through     in 2013, 228 in 2014, 257 in 2015, and 246 in 2016.   The difference of three murders from 2013 to 2016 constitutes a   1. 2% increase. ” ’   But    total crime  —   a compilation of seven major   categories: murder, rape, robbery, felony assault, burglary,   grand larceny, and grand larceny auto  —   has fallen significantly   since de Blasio took office.    crime as of     was at 78, 201 in 2013; 75, 916 in 2014; 73, 985 in   2015; and 72, 008 in 2016, according to Compstat. As a whole,   crime in those categories fell 7. 9% from 2013 to 2016. ’ ’   And that decrease happened while stops carried out   under    decreased as well. ’ ’ ’ ’ ’t’t’tOdd how wrong Trump is about crime in the city he lives in.  declined, so did murders. cc    ’ ’   J. Peter Donald, the assistant commissioner for communication and   public information at the NYPD, called the above a ”.” ’ ’ a     organization often at odds with the NYPD, confirmed the decline   in stops. The NYCLU relies on   data from NYPD   officers, however, which can prove problematic  —   especially   because a recent report found that in many cases officers   . ’ ’   Regardless, in 2013, New Yorkers were reportedly stopped by the   police 191, 558 times. By 2015, that number decreased to 22, 939,   according to the NYCLU. ’ ’   Over the past several years,    policing has gone by   the wayside across the US. In 2013, a judge ruled New York City’’s   use of it . And in 2015, a   report from President Barack Obama’’s  reported that   ”   campaigns harass   black and brown   citizens without contributing to public safety.” ’ ”   As for Trump’s claims that New York City went from having 2, 200   murders to 500 murders, he’s most likely referring to 1990,    up 17. 8% from the   previous year. More than two decades passed before that number   dropped below 500 in 2012. ” ’  ’ ”   Most important, New York City’s notable drop in murders   correlates to a nationwide drop in murders and crime, especially   in large cities. And while it’s hard to pinpoint a cause,   theories range from . ” ”   Though it’s difficult to isolate    as a variable,   simple data shows that crime continued to decrease even coupled   with a substantial decline in stops. ” ’   In 2002, when Michael Bloomberg  —   still a firm believer in     ’’s ability to ””  —   first took office as mayor, New Yorkers were   stopped by the police 97, 296 times, according to the NYCLU. Stops   peaked in 2011, still under Bloomberg’’s purview, with 685, 724   stops. By 2015, however, stops reached a   low of 22, 939. ’ ’   Despite a nearly 97% reduction in stops, the number of crimes   barely changed from 2011 to 2015. Crimes totaled 74, 566 in 2011,   compared with 73, 985 in 2015. ’ ”   While the decline in crime was starting to flatten out,  pointed to  a legal scholar and Columbia   University professor, and other researchers on Operation Impact,   a program under Bloomberg and Ray Kelly, then the police   commissioner, that placed newly graduated police rookies on foot   patrol in the city’s   neighborhoods, known as impact   zones. ” ’  ’ ”   The program presented an opportunity to study whether   investigative stops, or stops conducted with reasonable suspicion   that a crime had occurred, was occurring, or was about to occur,   contributed to New York’s stark decline in crime rate, according   to the authors. ” ’   The researchers concluded, however, that Operation Impact had a   ”statistically significant but relatively small association with   a reduction in total crimes.” That reduction was most pronounced   with    stops  —   which is not how a judge   ruled New York was conducting them in 2013. ’ ’   In fact, the study’’s authors warned against ”the cost of extra   intrusion and burdens on local residents that have no crime   reduction benefit.” ’ ’   Based on his research, Fagan told The Washington Post that   Trump’’s claims about    were ”not true, simply not   accurate.” ’
