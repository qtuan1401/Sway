Thursday at a rally in Kiawah, SC, Republican presidential candidate Donald Trump responded to Pope Francis questioning his faith by saying, “a person who thinks only about building walls wherever they may be is not a Christian. ”  Trump said, “If and when the Vatican is attacked by ISIS, which as everyone knows, is ISIS’ ultimate trophy, I can promise you that the Pope would have only wished and prayed Donald Trump would have been president, because, it’s true  it’s true this would not have happened because ISIS would have been eradicated. ” He added, “It’s disgraceful. I’m proud to be a Christian, and as president, I will not allow Christianity to be consistently attacked and weakened, unlike what is happening now with our current president. OK? Believe me. No leader, very important, and this is just given out to the press two seconds ago —  no leader, especially a religious leader, should have the right to question another man’s religion or faith. Especially when they feed all sorts of false information into them. They are using the Pope as a pawn, and they should be ashamed of themselves  —  that’s the Mexican government. They should be ashamed of themselves for doing so, especially when so many lives are involved and when illegal immigration is so rampant and dangerous and bad for the United States, OK? Period. That’s it. OK, period. So I come to this beautiful place and I look, everything is so beautiful. The people are beautiful. Everything is nice, and I get it. The Pope just made a statement. Did he say good things? No. I don’t think you’re going to like it so much. ” Follow Pam Key on Twitter @pamkeyNEN
