’  ’ ’   CNN anchor Jake Tapper spent more than   conducting a     interview with White House counselor Kellyanne   Conway, grilling her over a number of false claims made by   President Donald Trump and the White House.  ’ ’   Tapper pressed Conway about the list of terror attacks the White   House released Monday, claiming they were ”undercovered,” in   addition to  about the murder rate being at its   highest level in decades, and Conway’’s claim of a     ”Bowling Green massacre,” which she had subsequently apologized   for. The pair also discussed the legal case surrounding Trump’’s   executive order temporarily barring travel from seven     nations. ’ ’   On Trump’’s claims about the murder rate, Tapper said ”facts are   stubborn things,” adding, ”and to say that we’’re not reporting   something that happens not to be true, therefore we’’re not to be   trusted, that’’s a problem.” ’ ’   The exchange featured a number of surreal exchanges, such as   when Tapper asked whether Conway considers CNN to be ”fake news.” ’ ’   ”I don’’t think CNN is fake news,” she said. ”I think there are   some reports everywhere, in print, on TV, on radio, in   conversation, that are not well researched and are sometimes   based on falsehoods.” ’ ’   Pressed by Tapper about Trump’’s repeated falsehoods, with the CNN   anchor asking if they distract from what Conway said were ”the   many things that he says that are true that are making a   difference in people’’s lives,” she said the falsehoods served as   distractions ”if they’’re covered.” ’ ’ ’ ’CNN anchor Jake Tapper spent more than. ..’
