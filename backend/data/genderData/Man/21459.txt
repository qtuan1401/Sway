At Donald Trump’s Sunday rally at Madison City Stadium, two of Marco Rubio’s own constituents —  former Disney workers Leo Perrero and Dena Moore —  detailed on camera and to the entire crowd why they are endorsing Donald Trump for President.[  While Donald Trump has called on Disney to hire back every one of its workers and has pledged to stop   American job theft as president, Marco Rubio has pushed to expand the controversial program. As recently as last year, Rubio introduced a bill —   endorsed by Disney’s CEO Bob Iger via his immigration lobbying firm —   which would triple the issuances of   visas. Disney is one of Sen. Rubio’s top financial backers. At Sunday’s rally Trump slammed Rubio for prioritizing the interests of his donors at the expense of his own constituents: You can ask the Disney folks, you can ask the people who came up [on stage] who were just killed at Disney —   killed —   with their being replaced. They have to change jobs. They have to train people. And you heard the story —   you know who was in charge of that and the biggest proponent of doing that is? Little Marco Rubio. I mean this guy is bad news. In her address, Dena Moore told the crowd how “Rubio’s staff said in 2013, explaining the [guest worker expansions in Gang of Eight] bill, ‘American workers can’t cut it.’ Shame on you Marco Rubio,” Moore declared. “What a great disappointment Marco Rubio is,” Moore said. “Backed by Disney and other companies to push through legislation that has brought   visas to us and he has sabotaged Americans. ” “I believe Mr. Trump is for Americans first and foremost,” Moore said.
