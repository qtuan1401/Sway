NEW ORLEANS, Louisiana  —   What started as a protest against   Donald Trump soon turned to violent riots where one of New Orleans’ most famous monuments was covered in graffiti and glass windows were shattered out of a nearby bank. [Hundreds showed up to denounce the election of Trump —  but despite media reports of a peaceful gathering, the crowd grew increasingly hostile and violent, according to Breitbart Texas sources on the ground.  Students holding signs reading “End white supremacy” originally gathered on the steps of the Lee Circle monument before the demonstrations turned destructive. Lee Circle was fully covered in graffiti with phrases like “Black Power” and “Dismantle White Supremacy”. Later, an effigy of Trump was burned while glass windows at a nearby bank were shattered.  Other phrases like “No Trump, no KKK” were used to vandalize surrounding areas, as well as the threatening phrase “Die whites die” and “F*ck Trump”.  Now, New Orleans city workers are spending the day attempting to remove the vandalism across the city. A source close to Breitbart Texas said a group of rioters went back late in the night to Lee Circle and the surrounding area to do more damage, saying that was when some of the behavior grew out of control. Protests by liberal students and the social   of the Democratic Party began early yesterday, just a day after Trump’s victory over Democratic nominee Hillary Clinton. Trump, in a gracious speech to supporters, asked that the country come together and heal, along with President Obama, who mirrored Trump’s lead on the issue.
