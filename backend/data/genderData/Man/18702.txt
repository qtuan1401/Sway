On Monday’s broadcast of the Fox News Channel’s “Special Report,” columnist Charles Krauthammer stated that President Obama will be viewed as someone “who completely destroyed his presidency with liberal overreach, beginning with Obamacare. ”  Krauthammer said, [relevant remarks begin around 4:30] that while his party is “losing its mind,” President Obama is “concentrated” on “a smooth transition. ” He later added that Obama is “in denial. ” He continued that   Donald Trump’s election is “the demolition of eight years. ” Krauthammer continued Obama saw himself as a liberal version of Ronald Reagan and would bring about a “new liberal era, and it is falling apart.   …     [H]e decimated his party. ” Krauthammer concluded, “[H]istorians are going to see him as a textbook definition of a guy who won on hope and change, who won with a wave of goodwill, and who completely destroyed his presidency with liberal overreach, beginning with Obamacare. And this is a rejection of ideology. ” He further warned that if the Democratic Party goes further left, it won’t survive. Follow Ian Hanchett on Twitter @IanHanchett
