Actress Amber Tamblyn bashed the creators of the naked,   Donald Trump statues that popped up in several U. S. cities in recent weeks. [“Body shaming is never OK, even when it comes to Trump,” the Sisterhood of the Traveling Pants star said in a brief Facebook post late Sunday.  “These statues aren’t art: They are a lazy, unoriginal concept, stolen mind you, from Ilma Gore’s painting which already made this exact same point earlier this year,” Tamblyn wrote.  In February, Los   artist Ilma Gore unveiled a humiliating painting of a nude Donald Trump. Not made it down to see @illmagore’s trump masterpiece yet?

A group named Indecline, founded by Bum Fights creators Ryan MacPherson and Daniel Tanner, have claimed credit for the unflattering Trump sculptures, titled “The Emperor Has No Balls. ” “Like it or not, Trump is a    figure in world culture at the moment,” an Indecline spokesperson told the Washington Post Friday. The group approached a Las Vegas sculptor named Ginder, who happily took on the project. “When the guys from [Indecline] approached me, it was all because of my   abilities,” he told the Post. “Trump is just yet another monster, so it was absolutely in my wheelhouse to be able to create these monstrosities. ” However, Tamblyn says there’s nothing creative about the statues. “This is wholly unoriginal and uncreative,” the actress said.
