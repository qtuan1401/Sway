In response, a representative for the bar stated: The text is a series of comments that we leave at the bottom of our receipts. We change the receipts nearly daily and they touch on all sorts of politicians on both sides of the aisle, plus (mostly) our beloved Portland Trail Blazers. We’re surprised as anyone that these image went viral since it’s clearly a joke. We went private on all our accounts since after this happened we were inundated with a series of very serious death threats.
