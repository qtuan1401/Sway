Wednesday in New York City at Trump Tower,   Donald Trump and Vice   Mike Pence met with executives from several technology companies including Apple, Facebook, Microsoft, Cisco, Intel and Amazon.  Trump said, “I’m here to help you folks do well. And you’re doing well right now and I’m very honored by the bounce. They’re all talking about the bounce. So right now everybody in this room has to like me at least a little bit. We’re going to try to have that bounce continue. And, perhaps even more importantly, we want you to keep going with the incredible innovation. There’s nobody like you in the world. There’s nobody like the people in this room and anything we can do to help this go along, we’re going to be there for you and you’ll call my people, you’ll call me. It doesn’t make any difference, we have no formal chain of command around here. ” Follow Pam Key on Twitter @pamkeyNEN
