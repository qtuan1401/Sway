Democratic presidential candidate Hillary Clinton blasted Donald Trump in Monday night’s Democratic candidate forum in Iowa by calling him “basically a Democrat. ”[Clinton said that she did not buy Trump anything for his wedding, despite the fact that she was in attendance at the wedding. It is customary for guests to buy a wedding gift for the individuals getting married.  With Trump leading Clinton among white   voters and also among white   voters, Clinton is angling to knock Trump down in the Republican primary, apparently by attacking his conservative credentials. However, Trump’s viewpoints on trade and American sovereignty have remained consistent since 1988, when he showed up to support George Bush at the Republican National Convention.
