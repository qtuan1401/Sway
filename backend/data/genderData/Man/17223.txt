Sunday on New York AM 970 radio’s “The Cats Roundtable,” Gov. Scott Walker ( ) laid out the plan for Republican   nominee Mike Pence for the upcoming   debate.  According to Walker, Pence’s “job” will be to “quickly dismiss” attacks on Republican presidential nominee Donald Trump, and then pivot to Democratic presidential nominee Hillary Clinton’s problems. “All the research I did to help Mike Pence out with Tim Kaine suggests to me that Sen. Kaine will be very decent. He’ll come across as a   nice guy. But in the end he’ll take shot after shot after shot at Donald Trump. Mike Pence’s job is to come in and quickly dismiss these attacks and quickly pivot to the problems of Hillary Clinton,” Walker told host John Catsimatidis. Follow Trent Baker on Twitter @MagnifiTrent
