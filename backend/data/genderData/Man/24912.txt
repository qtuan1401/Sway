According to NBC News White House Correspondent Kristen Welker, the United Kingdom’s vote to separate from the E. U. has made Democrats “jittery. ”  She said Saturday on MSNBC of Brexit, “There’s no doubt that this is making Democrats jittery to some extent. For example, if the economy here starts to stall, that could make voters more likely to choose Donald Trump, a Republican candidate, and, of course, there’s concerns that what happened in Europe underscores that there is a stronger than expected populous sentiment here in the U. S. Secretary Clinton trying to reach out to the populous in her own party. Of course, Senator [Bernie] Sanders still technically in the race. ” Follow Trent Baker on Twitter @MagnifiTrent
