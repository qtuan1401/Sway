Artists, art collectors, curators and the scenesters who surround them are in Miami this week for Art Basel Miami Beach. It’s a spinoff of the fair held in Switzerland. (There’s also a Hong Kong version). Despite the party atmosphere, the art world may intimidate the uninitiated  —   especially with its terminology  —   so we’re here to offer some help. Showcasing “the masters of Modern and contemporary art” is Art Basel’s stated aim. Those categories may sound redundant, but they’re not. While “modern” can indicate the present, it is also tied to ideas that “were new or even experimental” when they were developed, according to the Museum of Modern Art. Contemporary means work by living artists. Just don’t confuse “master” with “Old Master,” which is a “distinguished European artist from about 1500 to the early 1700s. ” Think Michelangelo.
