The beheading video was inspired by Trump insulting former Fox News host Megyn Kelly, Griffin told a blogger. “I caption this ‘there was blood coming out of his eyes, blood coming out of his  …    wherever’ Also @tylershields great   maker,” Griffin tweeted on Tuesday. “OBVIOUSLY, I do not condone ANY violence by my fans or others to anyone, ever!

I move the line, then I cross it. I went way too far. The image is too disturbing. I understand how it offends people. It wasn’t funny. I get it. I’ve made a lot of mistakes in my career, I will continue. ” CNN called the beheading photo “disgusting” but did not definitely state Griffin would be prevented from   New Year’s Eve coverage. “We found what she did disgusting and offensive. We are pleased to see she has apologized and asked that the photos be taken down. We are evaluating our New Year’s Eve coverage and have made no decisions at this point,” CNN said in a statement.
