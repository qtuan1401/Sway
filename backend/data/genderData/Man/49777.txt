’  ’ ’     Donald Trump fired off a pair of tweets   on Friday targeting the individual who police killed after a   manhunt in connection to the Berlin terror attack earlier this   week where 12 people were killed when a truck plowed through   a Christmas market. ’ ’   The man who was killed, Anis Amri, was shot dead in Milan by   Italian police during a Friday morning shootout after a   continental manhunt for him. Amri was shown in a video,  after reports of his death surfaced pledging   allegiance to the terror organization ’ ’   ”I pledge my allegiance to the Emir of of the Faithful, Abu Bakr       for compliance and obedience, in vigor   and impulsion, abjectness and abundance, and in favoring his   preference to mine, and not contending the orders of his   trustees, unless I witness manifest disbelief,” he said. ’ ’   ”If you can fight, then fight,” he added. ”If you are in Europe   fight these crusade (sic) pigs. Each person up to his ability.” ’ ’   Trump tweeted about the video’’s release, and made a call to   ”fight back.” ’ ’’ ’  ’ ’  ’
