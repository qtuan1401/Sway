  Donald Trump’s popularity rose after he won the presidential election, the latest poll finds. [Almost half, or 46 percent of registered voters view Trump very favorably or somewhat favorably, according to a   Consult poll. Right before the election, only 37 percent viewed him favorably. Vice   Mike Pence is viewed favorably by 47 percent of voters.  The outgoing president’s popularity also rose after the election, with his approval standing at 54 percent. A strong majority, 61 percent, support restricting lobbyists from serving in the Trump administration, with 39 percent strongly supporting the move. Voters are more evenly divided on whether or not Trump will be able to reduce lobbyists’ influences in Washington, D. C.: 37 percent say it’s not likely, while 41 percent say it is. The poll also provides a look at how leftist media manufactures controversies: “Do you think certain members of the Trump family, chosen by Donald Trump, should be allowed to receive top secret security clearances, or not?” one question reads. Initial reports in the leftist media, citing “sources,” claimed that Trump wanted three of his children to have top secret security clearances. A transition team official later told pool reporters that such a request was never made. Nearly half, or 46 percent, say Trump’s transition team is as organized or more organized than previous administrations’.   percent say it’s less organized. The poll has a margin of error of plus or minus two percentage points and questioned 1, 885 registered voters from Nov. 16 to Nov. 18.
