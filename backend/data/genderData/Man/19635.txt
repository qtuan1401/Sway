Report states that Sheldon Adelson is making plans for Donald Trump to visit Israel before the Republican National Convention. [From The Guardian:  Conservative and   allies of Donald Trump are laying the groundwork for him to visit Israel this summer, an idea backed by Republican   Sheldon Adelson, who recently indicated in a meeting with the candidate that he would provide about $100m to help Trump win the presidency, conservative sources have told the Guardian. Three conservative sources with strong ties to Adelson say that the multibillionaire has touted the merits of a Trump trip to Israel, and planning has begun, though nothing has been finalized. “I’m sure Sheldon suggested the trip,” said one conservative donor close to Adelson. Mort Klein, who runs the Zionist Organization of America and is close to Adelson, told the Guardian that Trump’s point man for Israel, Jason Greenblatt, informed him several weeks ago that Trump was “going to go there [Israel] before the [GOP] convention” which begins on 18 July.
