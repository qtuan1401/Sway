’   A crowd gathered for a Donald Trump campaign rally in Wisconsin   on Monday evening broke out into a chant against House Speaker   Paul Ryan, who hails from the state. ’ ’   “Paul Ryan sucks!” chanted the Green Bay crowd as a local GOP   official spoke onstage. ’ ’ ’ ’Here’’s video of Trump crowd in Wisconsin breaking into ”Paul Ryan sucks” chant ’ ’   Ryan, the   elected Republican official in the   country,  that he would no   longer defend Trump or campaign for him throughout the remainder   of the election season. ’ ’   ”The speaker is going to spend the next month focused entirely on   protecting our congressional majorities,” Zack Roday, the press   secretary for the speaker’’s political office, said at the time in   a statement. ’ ’   And, while the Wisconsin Republican has maintained his   endorsement of the brash billionaire, Trump has zeroed in on him   in recent days. Last week  a ”weak and ineffective leader”   and, on Sunday, he fired off several tweets lambasting the   speaker for his lack of support. ’ ’’ ’   The relationship between Trump and Ryan has been lukewarm, at   best, throughout the election. ’ ’   Ryan shocked the political world when he initially refused to   offer Trump his endorsement after the   tycoon had   secured the GOP nomination. The House speaker later endorsed   Trump, explaining that he thought the billionaire would be the   better partner to work with to push through a conservative policy   agenda. ’
