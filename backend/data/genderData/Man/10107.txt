That instinct to humiliate when it’s modeled by someone in a public platform, it filters down into everyone’s life because it gives permission for others to do the same. ” “Disrespect invites disrespect, violence incites violence,” Streep said. Streep challenged a “principled press” to stand up to Trump “to hold power to hold power to account, to call to the carpet for every outrage. Streep called on Hollywood to support the Committee to Protect Journalists, “because we’re going to need them going forward  —   and they’ll need us to safeguard the truth. ” “Take your broken heart, make it into art,” Streep concluded, quoting the late actress Carrie Fisher.
