From Beth Reinhard writing at The Wall Street Journal:  So much for John Kasich’s promise to give rival Texas Sen. Ted Cruz “a clear path in Indiana. ” The Ohio governor cancelled some public events after striking a deal with Mr. Cruz to cede certain states to each other, but Mr. Kasich still met privately Tuesday in Indianapolis with about two dozen convention delegates and other prominent Republicans. He also attended two fundraisers. “It’s definitely confusing,” said Mike Murphy, a convention delegate and former chairman of the Indianapolis GOP who was at the meeting. “A lot of the people who were going to go with Kasich in Indiana now feel really adrift  …     I think the deal was a mistake. It’s contrived and smacks of desperation. ’’ Mr. Murphy hasn’t settled on a candidate since his first choice, former Florida Gov. Jeb Bush, dropped out of the race in February. He said Mr. Kasich said he has enough money to stay in the race and try to win the nomination at a contested convention in July, though Mr. Trump’s resounding victories in five states Tuesday make that scenario less likely.
