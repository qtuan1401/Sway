’  ’ ’   As President Donald Trump met with Australian Prime Minister   Malcolm Turnbull in New York on Thursday, he voiced his optimism   about the American Health Care Act. ’ ’   ”It’’s a very good bill right now, the premiums are going to come   down very substantially, the deductibles are going to come down,”   said Trump in a press conference with Turnbull. ”It’’s going to be   fantastic health care. Right now, Obamacare is failing.” ’ ’   The next comment Trump made; however, drew amusement from Sen.   Bernie Sanders of Vermont during an interview on MSNBC’’s ”All in   with Chris Hayes.” ’ ’   ”I shouldn’’t say this to our great gentlemen and my friend from   Australia . .. cause you have better healthcare than we do.” ’ ”   Australia’s universal healthcare system is administered by   the federal government. ” ’   ”Wait a minute . .. the president has just said it,” Sanders   exclaimed as he erupted in laughter. ”Let’’s take a look at the   Australian healthcare system. And let’’s move  —   maybe he wants to   take a look at the Canadian system or systems throughout Europe.   Thank you, Mr. President.” ’ ’   ”Let us move to a    system that does what every   other major country on the earth does  —   guaranteed healthcare to   all people at a fraction of the cost per capita that we spend.” ’ ’   ”Thank you Mr. President, we’’ll quote you on the floor of the   Senate,” said Sanders. ’ ’   The AHCA    through the House on a      vote on Thursday,   and is expected to go through an overhaul process in the Senate. ’ ’ ’ ’Trump: Australia has better health care than U.
