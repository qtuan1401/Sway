Jonathan Easley writes at The Hill that White House chief of staff Reince Priebus and chief strategist Stephen Bannon deny that they are not getting along despite recent stories to the contrary.   From the Hill: In a joint phone call with The Hill on Wednesday, White House chief of staff Reince Priebus and chief strategist Stephen Bannon furiously pushed back at reports of division, saying there is no friction between them.

But Bannon and Priebus insisted that they’re working closely and amicably together and that reports to the contrary are false. “Reince is doing an amazing job,” Bannon told The Hill. “We are executing on President Trump’s agenda in record time. That’s because Reince is getting the job done. ” Read the rest of the story here.
