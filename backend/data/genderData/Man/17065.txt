Presumptive Republican nominee Donald Trump issued a statement Friday shutting down the possibility of a debate with Sen. Bernie Sanders ( ) an idea that had been suggested earlier in the week. [“Based on the fact that the Democratic nominating process is totally rigged and Crooked Hillary Clinton and Deborah Wasserman Schultz will not allow Bernie Sanders to win, and now that I am the presumptive Republican nominee, it seems inappropriate that I would debate the second place finisher,” Trump stated.  Likewise, the networks want to make a killing on these events and are not proving to be too generous to charitable causes, in this case, women’s health issues. Therefore, as much as I want to debate Bernie Sanders  —   and it would be an easy payday  —   I will wait to debate the first place finisher in the Democratic Party, probably Crooked Hillary Clinton, or whoever it may be. The talk of a debate between Trump and Sanders came after Trump said he would “love to” debate Sanders during a television appearance Wednesday night.
