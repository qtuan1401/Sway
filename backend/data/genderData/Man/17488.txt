Conservative icon and legend Phyllis Schlafly reveals to Breitbart News the book cover of her upcoming book The Conservative Case for Trump. [In it, the    lawyer, bestselling author, and “sweetheart of the Silent Majority” makes her case why every conservative should vote for Donald Trump.   The book to sway doubting conservatives launches September 5, 2016 on Regnery. From Phyllis Schlafly, the woman whose celebrated classic A Choice Not An Echo (over 3 million copies sold) upended the 1964 Republican Convention, comes a persuasive new argument for a surprising conservative choice: Donald Trump. For the first time since 1980, a significant number of Republicans are considering abandoning their party’s nominee. This is a grave mistake, Schlafly says —  because a Donald Trump “radical redirection” could actually set America back on the path of Reagan’s conservative revolution. In The Conservative Case for Trump, Schlafly and her coauthors Ed Martin and Brett M. Decker set aside the circus of the campaign and zero in on ten defining points of the Trump agenda to convince Republican voters that Donald Trump —  improbable as it may seem —  is the true conservative we’ve been waiting for.
