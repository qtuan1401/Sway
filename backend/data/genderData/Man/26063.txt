Breitbart Senior Editor Milo Yiannopoulos spoke at West Virginia University today discussing the   Donald Trump, the death of Fidel Castro and campus censorship via security fee price increases.[  Speaking about the recent celebrities that claimed they would emigrate to Canada if Donald Trump were to become president and the leftist praise that Cuban dictator Fidel Castro received upon his death, MILO said, “We know Hollywood loves communists, but they wouldn’t even go to Venezuela. I did publish a plan this week to help them out.  My simple proposal, the MILO Plan, is to relocate Hollywood celebrities, journalists, and anyone else too scared to live in Trump’s America  …      to Cuba. They can culturally appropriate the food, and maybe even the poverty and misery of living under a brutal dictator. ”  MILO continued. “Actors love attention, and Cuba will need some   attention seekers to give their attention to now that Fidel has become one one of the only good communists.  His brother Raul just doesn’t have the same charisma you know?  All of the poverty, none of the machismo. What do you think?  Should we send Lena Dunham, Cher, and Jon Stewart down to Cuba? They’d probably all convert to Islam in the hopes of sneaking into Gitmo. The meals are better, I hear. No Kellogg’s for one thing. ” Discussing   Donald Trump’s recent negotiation with Carrier to keep 1000 jobs in the United States, MILO said, “Regardless of which group you happen to be a part of, Donald Trump and his presidency will have lasting effects on your life. For some, this has already happened.  The workers for Carrier in Indiana will keep jobs that were going to Mexico. The same thing with Ford workers in Kentucky.  He is saving the economy and he hasn’t even taken office yet!” Written from prepared remarks.  Watch the full event below:
