’  ’ ”   Conservative columnist George Will said Friday that he’s leaving   the GOP over Donald Trump’s rise to becoming the party’s standard   bearer. ” ’   Will suggested that a Democratic victory in the presidential   election in November would be preferable to Trump winning the   White House. ’ ’   ”Make sure he loses,” Will  a conservative blog. ”Grit their teeth for   four years and win the White House.” ’ ’   He said he changed his voter registration from ”Republican” to   ”unaffiliated.” ’ ’   During a speech at a Federalist Society lunch, Will lamented what   has become of the Republican Party. ’ ’’ ’   ”This is not my party,” he said, according to PJ Media. ’ ’   Will also slammed House Speaker Paul Ryan for endorsing Trump,   saying a Trump presidency without opposition from a     Congress would be worse than a Hillary Clinton   presidency with a   Congress. ’ ”   Will joins the ranks of other prominent Republicans who are   distancing themselves from the party and its likely presidential   nominee. Mitt Romney, the Republican nominee in 2012, has been   speaking out against Trump for months, and even Ryan has   criticized some of Trump’s more controversial pronouncements. ” ”   Trump has said he’d prefer the party to get behind him, but   doesn’t seem to be too concerned about his chances in the   election if he’s left out in the cold by other Republicans. ” ’   ”I think that I win either way,” he said earlier this month. ”I   can win one way or the other.” ’ ’Conservative columnist George Will. ..’
