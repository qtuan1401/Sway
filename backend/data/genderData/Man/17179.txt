Shawn Moran, Spokesperson for the National Border Patrol Council, which has endorsed Republican presidential candidate Donald Trump, stated that “President Obama has created a blueprint for an open borders catastrophe, and that’s exactly what we’re seeing in Europe” on Friday’s “Risk  Reward with Deirdre Bolton” on the Fox Business Network.  Moran said, “I don’t things are getting better. I think the  —   I’m going to call it what it is, it’s a lie that the numbers are down. Apprehensions are up. They’re up dramatically. And for what you would term exotic illegal aliens, people from Middle Eastern countries, special interest countries, is what we call them, they are up significantly. So, we’re seeing people from Pakistan, Afghanistan, Nepal, just places that we normally don’t see regularly, agents are now reporting that we’re seeing more and more. So that is a concern. And it should be concerning to the administration. ” He added, “We’re still seeing numbers from Mexico up.   …     Border Patrol agents are telling us that assaults are up, apprehensions are up, across the board, Central Americans, Mexicans, special interest countries. President Obama has created a blueprint for an open borders catastrophe, and that’s exactly what we’re seeing in Europe. ” Follow Ian Hanchett on Twitter @IanHanchett
