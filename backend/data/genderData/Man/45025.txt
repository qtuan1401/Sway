’  ’ ”   President Donald Trump is set to pick two nominees for the   Federal Reserve’s board of governors, according to a report. ” ’   report that Trump will tap Randal Quarles and Marvin Goodfriend   for two of the open spots on the board, citing sources familiar   with the decision. ’ ’   Quarles served at the Treasury Department under President George   W. Bush. Goodfriend, a professor at Carnegie Mellon University,   previously worked as a policy adviser at the Federal Reserve Bank   of Richmond in Virginia. ’ ’   The White House told The Times that no announcement was pending. ’ ”   At the Fed, Quarles would also oversee banking regulation. The   former Fed official in charge of this, Daniel Tarullo, was   stricter, but given Trump’s calls for deregulation at the big   banks, Quarles would be expected to take a softer stance. ” ’’ ’   Both Quarles and Goodfriend are seen as more conservative   economists, according to the Times report. ’ ’   This would be the first in a series of changes Trump is expected   to make at the Fed. A third seat on the board remains open, and   the terms of Chair Janet Yellen and Vice Chair Stanley Fischer   expire in 2018, giving Trump two more spots to fill. ’ ’President Donald Trump is set to pick two. ..’ ’’ ’’ ’’
