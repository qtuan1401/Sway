Republican nominee Donald Trump renewed his attack on the media Monday morning  —   specifically MSNBC’s Morning Joe hosts Mika Brzezinski and Joe Scarborough  —   sparking a Twitter war between Scarborough and Trump.  Trump apparently didn’t like their coverage on Monday morning, although he previously had an amicable relationship with the hosts, tweeting personal attacks against Brzezinski and alleging that the two morning   were a romantic item. Tried watching   @Morning_Joe this morning,  unwatchable! @morningmika is off the wall, a neurotic and not very bright mess!  —   Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) August 22, 2016,  Some day, when things calm down, I’ll tell the real story of @JoeNBC and his very insecure   girlfriend, @morningmika. Two clowns!  —   Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) August 22, 2016,  Trump was referencing a report about “romance chatter” between Scarborough and Brzezinski in the New York Post‘s Page Six. According to CNN, Trump’s personal attack on Brzezinski comes after his new campaign manager, Kellyanne Conway, stated that the Republican nominee doesn’t use “personal insults. ” Scarborough responded to Trump’s tweets Monday morning on Twitter, quoting Conway and standing up for his   Brzezinski. Neurotic and not very bright? Look in the mirror.  https:  .   —   Joe Scarborough (@JoeNBC) August 22, 2016,  Thanks for watching.
