Alumni from the University of Pennsylvania are planning to protest one the school’s most notable graduates by wearing “Denounce Trump” buttons at their upcoming reunion. [“More than a dozen” graduates of the University of Pennsylvania class of 1967, from which President Trump graduated in 1968, will be wearing “Denounce Trump” buttons at their upcoming reunion, according to a story in The Daily Pennsylvania.  Over the next three days, more than a dozen attendees of the 1967 class reunion and graduation ceremony will wear buttons calling upon Penn to “Denounce Trump,” who graduated from Wharton in 1968. Graduate Michael Sales, who created a Facebook group for the Class of 1967, started an initiative within the class to “disavow the intolerant views” of Trump. “How do you not discuss the   elephant in the room?” Sales wrote. Despite reunion   and 1967 class president Howard Freedlander asking “his friend and classmate to refrain from politicizing the online page and their upcoming reunion,” Sales pushed forward, ordering 100 lapel buttons in the university’s colors that read, “Denounce Trump. ” Tom Ciccotta is a libertarian who writes about economics and higher education for Breitbart News.
