Sunday on NBC News’ “Meet the Press,” former Obama campaign manager David Plouffe called Republican presidential nominee Donald Trump “a psychopath” in describing his run for president.  Plouffe  said, “I think the assessment was that Donald Trump would do some things to appeal to the middle of the electorate, to appeal to suburban college educated woman. He’s not. We basically have a psychopath running for president. I mean he meets the clinical definition. ” Host Chuck Todd pushed back, saying, “Wait a minute. Do you really think  —   diagnosing people on air and I assume you don’t have a degree in psychology, is that fair? I mean, we’re jumping to conclusions here. I think this is what gets voters frustrated with this kind of thing. ” Plouffe  added, “Listen. He  —   the grandiose notion of   pathological lying, lack of empathy and remorse. I think he does, right? I don’t have a degree in psychology but here is  —   Chuck, basically the race sits today. I think Hillary Clinton is guaranteed at least 269 electoral votes because Virginia and Colorado both campaigns are put away. ” Follow Pam Key on Twitter @pamkeyNEN
