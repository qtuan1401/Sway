We train leaders to build bases in our communities, organize elected officials and other powerful people to put the interests of people and the planet first. The People’s Lobby’s Center for Progressive Strategy and Research’s lengthy manifesto says, in part: “There is a silent progressive majority to the left of both the Tea Party and mainstream Democrats like Clinton and Obama, and it is ready to be transformed into a populist progressive movement in electoral politics. Such a movement would capture a much larger base than that of the Tea Party, and it would be much more powerful. We must seize this opportunity by building indecent political organizations capable of electing movement progressives to office. ” It also states it supports globalization and rejects national borders.
