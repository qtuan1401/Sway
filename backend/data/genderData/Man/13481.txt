In a comment, Breitbart Senior editor MILO said “I’m constantly accused of ‘hate speech’ and ‘violent words’ by journalists, activists, and officials. In the U. K, the government’s ‘ ’ task force intervened to stop me speaking at my old school. If my detractors are really so concerned about words that inspire hate and violence, it’s clear that they ought to be turning their spotlights on   professors and gender studies departments first. That’s where the thugs who beat up Trump supporters and throw around threats of violence are coming from. ” MILO’s event at the University of Washington is set to take place on January 20.
