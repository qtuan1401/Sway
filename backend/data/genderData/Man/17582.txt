Former president Bill Clinton again belittled the “coal people” who oppose Hillary Clinton for president  —   even though, he says, they voted for him in the 1990s. [“We all know how her opponent’s done real well down in West Virginia and eastern Kentucky,” Clinton said during a rally in Pennsylvania. “Because the coal people don’t like any of us anymore. ”   Clinton said that many of the same people voted for him in the 1990s, which helped propel him to victory over Republicans George H. W. Bush and Bob Dole. “I won twice and they did well,” Clinton said, referring to economic stability during his administration. Clinton said that coal workers blamed President Obama for their economic misfortunes. “They blame the president when the sun doesn’t come up in the morning now,” Clinton said. Clinton also criticized coal workers during a rally in Tampa earlier this week, pointing out that they were wearing Trump shirts and “screaming” at him when he visited the state. He accused them of believing that global warming was a “Chinese hoax,” much like Donald Trump. He argued that coal workers should realize that the industry was dying and that it was time to focus on solar panels and windmills. “Coal employment peaked in 1920, coal production peaked in 1950,” he said, adding, “Climate change is real and we’re going to have to change our energy source. ”
