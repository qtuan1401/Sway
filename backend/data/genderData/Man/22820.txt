President Barack Obama is on vacation, but it appears that Donald Trump’s presidential run is still weighing on him even as he spends most of his time on the golf course. [“Frankly, I’m tired of talking about her opponent,” Obama said during a fundraiser for Hillary Clinton on Martha’s Vineyard. “I don’t have to make the case against her opponent because every time he talks he makes the case against his own candidacy. ”  The fundraiser was hosted by real estate executive Hank Goldberg and his wife Carol at their home in Chilmark. Obama warned Democrats that they should be “running scared” despite Trump’s apparent political meltdown since the Republican convention. “If we are not running scared until the day after the election, we are going to be making a grave mistake,” he said. He described the current election season as “unpredictable” and cited anxious Americans and the changing media landscape as well as voting patterns, adding that it was still possible that Clinton could lose. Obama said that Democrats veered between “   ” mode and the notion that everything was fine, during the election season. “What I’d like us to do is veer somewhere in between those two extremes,” he said.
