Welcome to Breitbart News’s livewire of the 89th annual Academy Awards. [The Oscars kick off at 5:30 p. m. PT, but Hollywood’s biggest stars have already begun arriving on the red carpet. Jimmy Kimmel hosts this year’s ceremony live from the Dolby Theater in Hollywood.  The storylines to watch:  —   How many wins can the musical La La Land rack up out of its record 14 total nominations? Director Damien Chazelle and leads Ryan Gosling and Emma Stone are all hoping for big nights in their respective categories, though Gosling faces stiff competition from Denzel Washington (Fences) and Casey Affleck (Manchester by the Sea).  —   Which stars will use the Oscars stage to launch   Trump tirades? Meryl Streep  —   up for a record 20th Oscar nom for Florence Foster Jenkins  —   is set as a presenter, so there is a decent possibility of a Golden   encore, but it could really come from all angles tonight. Look out for Kimmel to zing Trump in his opening monologue.  —   Mel Gibson’s Hacksaw Ridge is up for six awards, but don’t expect him to win Best Director. Chazelle is the overwhelming favorite in the category, though Kenneth Lonergan (Manchester by the Sea) or Barry Jenkins (Moonlight) could pull it out. Follow along with Breitbart News as the Oscars get underway in Los Angeles. Latest updates at the top. All times Pacific.   9:25 P. M.  —   That’s it for the livewire. Stay tuned for some   coverage, including what just happened with the Best Picture announcement, which was probably the most epic gaffe in Oscars history. So long for now,  . N.  . H. 9:13 P. M.  —   Good god. This has got to be the most surreal ending to an Oscars broadcast ever. Moonlight has won Best Picture. Warren Beatty and Faye Dunaway read the wrong title off the card, announcing La La Land as Best Picture. Kimmel blames Steve Harvey. No one in the audience can quite believe it. This is an epic  . More coming shortly. New rule: After that astonishing #Oscars gaffe, no one in Hollywood can make fun of @realDonaldTrump for anything over the next eight years.  —   Joel B. Pollak (@joelpollak) February 27, 2017,  9:03 P. M.  —   Warren Beatty and Faye Dunaway appear together on stage to present Best Picture. Awesome. 9:00 P. M.  —   One more big one to go.

An emotional Stone gives a heartfelt   to the other actresses in the category and thanks her family and the filmmakers. 8:48 P. M.  —   Casey Affleck wins Best Actor for Manchester by the Sea. Wow. I thought Denzel had this one on lock. Looks like Affleck got his   out of the way last night, though, because this acceptance speech is short and sweet. “I wish I had something bigger and more meaningful to say. ” We don’t, so thanks for keeping it short. 8:43 P. M.  —   At 32, Damien Chazelle becomes the youngest director ever to win the Best Director prize, for La La Land. 8:34 P. M.  —   Barry Jenkins and Tarrell Alvin McCraney win Best Adapted Screenplay for Moonlight. Both men wear ACLU ribbons, and get slightly political with their speeches. Jenkins vows to work over the next four years to inspire those who feel they’re not represented in films, while McCraney dedicates the award to boys, girls and “  conforming” young people. Barry Jenkins: ”For the next 4 years it will not be you alone. We will not forget you.” #Oscars pic. twitter.   —   Hollywood Reporter (@THR) February 27, 2017,  8:31 P. M.  —   Kenneth Lonergan wins Best Original Screenplay for Manchester by the Sea. Some observers thought this one was a lock for La La Land (Chazelle) or even Hell or High Water (Taylor Sheridan) so this is a big win for Lonergan. 8:28 P. M.  —   Ok, this is great. Kimmel is participating in the celebrity “inspiration” videos, talking about how his nemesis Matt Damon has inspired him. The movie that most inspired him is Damon’s We Bought a Zoo. The Oscars announcer introduces “Ben Affleck and Guest,” as Affleck and Damon take the stage. The music guy cuts off Damon every time he tries to speak. The camera pans back and it’s Kimmel directing the orchestra. Probably the funniest bit of the night. 8:26 P. M.  —   With 8:44 to go in the fourth, Charlotte has taken the lead.

M.  —   Another shot at Trump. Kimmel is upset that Trump isn’t tweeting about the Oscars.

My access is out of respect for the people of my country and those of six other nations who have been disrespected by the inhumane law that bans entry of immigrants to the U. S.,” the statement read. “Dividing the world into us and our enemies categories creates fear. Filmmakers can turn their cameras to create and capture human qualities.

M.  —   Kimmel jokes that Viola Davis was just nominated for an Emmy for her acceptance speech. Introduces a segment in which current stars talk about the stars of the past that inspired them. First up is Charlize Theron talking about Shirley MacLaine. Seems pretty late into the broadcast to be introducing a segment like this. This show is gonna go on for well over 3 hours. Get comfortable. 6:44 P. M.  —    Viola Davis wins her first Oscar, Best Supporting Actress for Fences. Davis was a lock for this category.

Kimmel urges the audience to reach out to one person you have a disagreement with, not as a liberal or conservative, and have a positive conversation with them. That would be a way to “make America great again,” he says. But the moment is   as Kimmel calls President Trump a racist just one minute later. He thanks the president: “Remember last year when we thought the Oscars were racist?” The host also roasts the stars by saying (rightly) that no one came out to see their films.
