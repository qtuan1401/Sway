Washington (CNN) Former ”Apprentice” contestant and Donald Trump surrogate Erin Elmore will no longer be joining the Republican convention’s caucus operation team as deputy press secretary, according to a statement issued Monday. The move that she would be was reported earlier by PhillyChitChat. com and Philadelphia Magazine. Elmore was to be part of a rapid response communications team that will work as an intermediary between the Trump campaign and the national convention staff.  But on Monday, a statement by the Republican National Convention said: ”Erin Elmore, who was recently named as a valued deputy press secretary for caucus operations, has left the team and remains active as one of the campaign’s surrogate media spokespeople.” Elmore said Monday she could be a ”more effective advocate for Donald Trump’s election as as surrogate on TV rather than working behind the scenes in Cleveland.” Elmore was a local news reporter in Jacksonville, Florida, and a guest host on QVC. Most recently, she has appeared as an analyst on several news networks, including CNN. The Trump campaign did not immediately respond to a request for comment. CORRECTION: An earlier version of this story misstated Elmore’s position. She was joining the Republican National Convention team, not the Trump campaign.
