’  ’ ”   Democratic Rep. John Lewis of Georgia on Friday leveled harsh   words at   Donald Trump, saying he doesn’t think   Trump’s presidency is legitimate. ” ’   ”I don’’t see this   as a legitimate president,”   Lewis told  interview set to   air on Sunday. ’ ”   Lewis pointed to allegations of Russian interference in the   recent election, including a dossier  about Trump’s potential ties to Russia. ” ’   ”The Russians participated in helping this man get elected, and   they helped destroy the candidacy of Hillary Clinton,” Lewis   said. ’ ’   The   Democrat from Georgia was the youngest member of   the ”Big Six” group of   leaders, which included   Martin Luther King Jr. in the 1960s, and he was instrumental in   organizing the marches from Selma to Montgomery in Alabama. ’ ’’ ”   Lewis said he won’t attend Trump’s inauguration. This will be the   first time he’s skipped the ceremony since he was elected to   Congress in 1986. ” ’   ”You cannot be at home with something that you feel that is   wrong,” Lewis told Todd. He said it was a ”conspiracy on the part   of the Russians” to help Trump get elected. ’ ’   ”That’’s not right. That’’s not fair,” Lewis said. ”That’’s not the   open, democratic process.” ’
