Although Stephen Colbert made a name for himself mocking Fox News on his   Comedy Central show “The Colbert Report,” for his big   Bowl “Late Show,” the   comedian has invited Fox News’s Megyn Kelly to appear. Her ongoing feud with Republican frontrunner Donald Trump combined with her Michael Moore   appear to have put Kelly’s celebrity on the rise.  In the   department, Kelly and Colbert should have much to talk about: Trump, meanwhile, is one of Colbert’s favorite topics, and there’s almost no   subject he cannot segue into a Trump gag. Colbert so loves the subject that, before taking over Late Show in September, he confessed to a gaggle of reporters at TCA, he was “ ” in anticipation of having the CBS   platform to further eviscerate the   magnet turned reality TV     . After the Super Bowl, Kelly will appear with those other industry luminaries during Colbert’s live broadcast from the Ed Sullivan Theater in New York City. The CBS decision to air “The Late Show” directly after the Super Bowl is a first for a late night talk show, and a sign of how much trouble Colbert is in. Since taking the helm from David Letterman, “The Late Show’s” ratings have remained in the toilet. For her part, Megyn Kelly appears to be entering the Nicolle         Parker Zone  —   the zone that offers the SWEET EMBRACE OF WARM ACCEPTANCE from the mainstream media and entertainment world to those (from the likes of a Fox News)  willing to publicly bash and damage Republicans (while playing   with a Michael Moore). This insidious but effective system, that lavishes piles of rewards and celebrity on those elites willing to sell out, has been in place for decades  —   because it works.
