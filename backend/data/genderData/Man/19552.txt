Tuesday on the Fox broadcasting special “Megyn Kelly Presents,” presumptive Republican presidential nominee Donald Trump said the he thought the debate question that started the issue between he and host Megyn Kelly wasn’t a question, but instead “more of a statement. ”  Partial transcript as follows: KELLY: Right? And then came the August 6, 2015 debate, and I asked you a tough question about women, using only the words that you had used. I thought it was a fair question. Why didn’t you? TRUMP: I thought it was unfair, I thought it   …     First of all, I didn’t think it was really a question. I thought it was more of a statement. That’s the first question that I’ve ever been asked during a debate. And I’ve never debated before. I mean, my whole life is a debate, but I’ve never actually debated before. And I’m saying to myself, “Man, what a question. ” And then, of course, then you have Bret doing his thing. So I’m saying to myself, “I got two hours of this?” I don’t really blame you because you’re doing your thing. But from my standpoint, I don’t have to like it. Follow Pam Key on Twitter @pamkeyNEN
