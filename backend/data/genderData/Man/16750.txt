  Donald Trump has added three top level executives to his administration as advisors on economic affairs, including SpaceX and Tesla founder Elon Musk as well as the CEO’s of PepsiCo and Uber. [In a press release on Wednesday, the Trump transition team confirmed that Musk, who previously said Donald Trump “was not the right guy” for the presidency, as well as Uber and Pepsi CEO’s Travis Kalanick and Indra Nooyi, will join the Trump administration to advise on economic issues.  The appointments are the first signs that the Trump administration is mending ties with Silicon Valley, who apart from PayPal   Peter Thiel, overwhelmingly opposed his candidacy for the presidency. Before these announcements, only IBM’s CEO Ginni Rometty had been chosen to serve on the board of economic advisory, whilst Peter Thiel confirmed he would serve the administration as an informal technology advisor. “My administration is going to work together with the private sector to improve the business climate and make it attractive for firms to create new jobs across the United States from Silicon Valley to the heartland,” Trump said in a statement. Trump will also meet with a range of Silicon Valley executives, including Apple CEO Tim Cook, Facebook COO Sheryl Sandberg, and Amazon CEO Jeff Bezos, for a technology summit to be held at Trump Tower.
