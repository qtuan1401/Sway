Earlier this week on his radio show, conservative talk show host Mark Levin took aim at Republican presidential   for his tweets.  Levin told his listeners he fears Trump’s Twitter activity could result in a blow out for Republicans in the 2016 general election and pointed to the negative numbers Trump has among some segments of the electorate. “As a matter of fact, I’m starting to think we’re not going to win,” he said. “It’s actually been in the back of my mind for some time now. I don’t know whether we will. I’m not Nostradamus. I’m not a pollster. But, I fear we’re going to get blown out, and part of it is tactics, and part of it, quite frankly is Donald Trump’s tweeting problems. He tweets like he has Tourette’s, like he’s obsessed. Nothing personal, but it gets crazier and crazier, and it’s turning off more and more people. And people can pretend otherwise. They really can. But these negative numbers are coming in big time. A negative view of Trump: 70 percent of women, 72 percent of millennials, 83 percent of blacks, 77 percent of Hispanics. Here you go, 68 percent of suburbanites. ” Follow Breitbart. tv on Twitter @BreitbartVideo
