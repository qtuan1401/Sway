GOP frontrunner Donald Trump says Apple is “100 percent wrong” for not providing the FBI access to the San Bernardino terrorist’s iPhone. [“We have to find out what’s on those phones,” the real estate mogul said during an interview on Breitbart News Daily with host Stephen K. Bannon. “They should break into the phone. ”  He added that Apple was “100 percent wrong” for not complying with the FBI’s request for the information to aid the investigation. The FBI requested Apple create software in order to access an iPhone 5c owned by Syed Rizwan Farook, the terrorist behind the San Bernardino attack. Apple’s CEO Tim Cook said this action is “too dangerous. ” “Up to this point, we have done everything that is both within our power and within the law to help them,” Cook stated. “But now the U. S. government has asked us for something we simply do not have, and something we consider too dangerous to create. ” Breitbart News Daily airs weekdays from 6 AM to 9 AM on SiriusXM Patriot Ch. 125.
