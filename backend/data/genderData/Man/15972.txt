Trump campaign manager Corey Lewandowski says that Fox News will have lousy ratings in its debate  —   if it doesn’t have Donald Trump on stage, and that would likely anger advertisers. [“You and I both know the only reason their ratings are as high as they were on the first debate is because Donald Trump was on the stage,” he said on Good Morning America this morning with George Stephanopoulos, reminding him that it was among the highest rated cable events in history with 24 million viewers.  Lewandowski predicted in an interview with MSNBC’s Morning Joe that without Trump in the debate, Fox would get   million viewers. He also floated the option of working with another network for Trump’s proposed event to raise money for wounded veterans. He also pointed out that advertisers were likely very unhappy with Fox for pushing Trump offstage. “My guess is that people who bought advertising time thinking that Donald Trump was going to be on the stage are going to be very disappointed when nobody decides to watch that GOP debate,” Lewandowski said to Stephanopoulos.
