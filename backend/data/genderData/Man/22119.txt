According to Michigan’s Secretary of State, Ruth Johnson, “turnout is robust” in areas across the Great Lakes States and could achieve a record. [The March presidential primary already shattered a   record with 2. 5 million voters.  MLive quotes Johnson saying absentee ballot returns are 18 percent over typical elections. Long lines were reported in Grand Rapids, where Donald Trump made a   campaign stop on Monday, and in Detroit. Detroit polling places reported “disorganization,” ballot outages, and frustrated voters giving up and leaving. One Detroit voter was unable to leave a polling place on the east side of the city, because his hand got stuck in a voting machine. However, Johnson said of overall performance by voting machines: “So far, so good. ” “Things turned heated in Ypsilanti Township, southeast of Ann Arbor, where two voters got into an altercation about their respective candidates. A man ended up shoving one woman, with another woman spitting at people after a group of   people  started to yell,” MLive reports.
