It’s now day 263 since Hillary Clinton held a press conference. Her next scheduled public event is in Reno, Nevada on August 25, and she doesn’t have another scheduled appearance until August 31 in Ohio. [Republican National Committee Chairman Reince Priebus is calling for the Democrat presidential nominee to take unscripted questions from the press during a press conference.  “It’s time for Hillary Clinton to hold a press conference to explain the brazen conflicts of interest and obvious    politics that went on in her State Department,” RNC Chairman Reince Priebus said in a statement to the media. “Clinton owes explanations for why she broke ethics agreements regarding foreign donations to her family foundation, gave preferential treatment to foundation donors as secretary of state, and why we should believe that her secret server wasn’t designed to cover up the shady    politics at her State Department. ” In a separate release to the media, the Trump campaign’s National Policy Director Stephen Miller proposed asking #HidingHillary this question: “Secretary Clinton, you claim the AP report is an incomplete accounting of your meetings. Why don’t you clear up any problems with the AP report by releasing all of your schedules from while you were in charge of the State Department?” Miller’s question comes after it was revealed yesterday that half of the people who met with Hillary at the State Department had donated to the Clinton Foundation.
