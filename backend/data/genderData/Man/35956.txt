Washington (CNN) Donald Trump’s latest jab at Mexico is taking off.  As a plane flew overhead at Trump’s Thursday afternoon town hall in Manchester, New Hampshire, Trump said, ”That could be a Mexican plane up there    they’re getting ready to attack.” Trump was talking trade in New Hampshire, touting his plans to renegotiate the North American Free Trade Agreement, which he said has allowed Mexico to siphon away U. S. manufacturing jobs.  The presumptive Republican nominee has made building a wall along the U. S.  border a centerpiece of his economic platform, and has angered Hispanic voters as well as immigrants’ rights groups when he said last year that some of those people crossing the U. S.’s southern border illegally were ”rapists” and ”killers.”
