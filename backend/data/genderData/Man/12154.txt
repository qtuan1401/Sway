And I suspect he’ll be confirmed before we break at the end of next week to spend the Easter period in our states with our constituents. ” He added that he hasn’t given up hope that at least eight Democrats will support Gorsuch’s nomination, but if the Democrats filibuster Gorsuch, “I believe the House  —   or the Senate Republicans will do what we must to put Neil Gorsuch on the Supreme Court. ” Follow Ian Hanchett on Twitter @IanHanchett
