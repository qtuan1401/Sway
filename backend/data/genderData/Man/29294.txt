This week’s OC Weekly cover features a Democratic donkey, with a Hillary for America tattoo, raping a naked depiction of Republican presidential frontrunner Donald Trump.  BTW, the idea for this cover came from our former sister paper the Riverfront Times, who infamously had the Democratic donkey humping former Missouri congressman Todd “Legitimate Rape” Akins on its cover in 2012 —  good stuff! The OC Weekly cover arrives just one month away from the California primary, which will likely decide the state of the race in the Democratic Party. Clinton, the presumptive Democratic nominee, is just 178 total delegates away from clinching the party’s nomination. Follow Adelle Nazarian on Twitter @AdelleNaz
