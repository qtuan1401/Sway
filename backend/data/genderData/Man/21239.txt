GOP presidential   Donald Trump sat down for an interview with Fox News Channel’s Judge Jeanine Pirro that aired Saturday on “Justice. ”  Trump told Pirro that the Republican National Committee, including chairperson Reince Priebus, has treated him fairly. “The RNC has treated me fairly,” Trump said. “Reince [Priebus] has been very good   …     Don’t forget, he was looking at 18, and probably at the highest point 18 people, and they were governors and they were senators, and not everybody agrees with everything I’m doing. ” Follow Trent Baker on Twitter @MagnifiTrent
