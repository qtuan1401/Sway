The latest poll in New York shows Donald Trump comfortably ahead in his home state  —   leading his rivals by 43 points, according to the   College poll. [Sixty percent of likely Republican voters in the state support Trump. Ted Cruz only has 17 percent. John Kasich is in third with 14 percent.  To sweep the state’s 95 delegates, Trump would need to win more than 50 percent of the Republican primary votes in each congressional district on April 19. But while Trump is popular among Republicans, he is not necessarily popular with the rest of the state. The poll of all voters showed that 60 percent of New York residents have an unfavorable view of Trump.
