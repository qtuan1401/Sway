’  ’ ’   President Barack Obama condemned the  that left at least   three   officials dead Sunday.  ’ ’  ’ ’   ”There is no justification for violence against law enforcement.   None. These attacks are the work of cowards who speak for no   one,” Obama said in a statement  ”The officers in Baton   Rouge, the officers in Dallas  —   they were our fellow Americans,   part of our community, part of our country, with people who loved   and needed them, and who need us now  —   all of us  —   to be at our   best.” ’ ’   Speaking to reporters later in the White House briefing room, the   President called for unity and warned speakers at the upcoming   Republican and Democratic conventions this month to temper their   political rhetoric. ’ ’  ’ ’’ ’  ’ ”   Obama’s statement Sunday echoed his remarks during the memorial   service for five Dallas police officers who died earlier   this month after a gunman targeted city police officers following   a peaceful protest. In a speech early last week, Obama   called for unity in the face of violence.  ” ’   The president was one of many public figures on Sunday   who spoke out against the attack.  ’ ’   In a Facebook post Sunday, presumptive Republican presidential   nominee Donald Trump denounced the shooting and claimed that a   ”lack of leadership” has encouraged violence against law   enforcement ’ ’   ”We grieve for the officers killed in Baton Rouge today. How many   law enforcement and people have to die because of a lack of   leadership in our country? We demand law and order,” . ’
