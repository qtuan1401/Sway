Vice presidential candidate Tim Kaine defends San Francisco 49ers quarterback Colin Kaepernick for choosing to sit during the national anthem to protest police officers. [“I wouldn’t presume to tell him what to do,” Kaine said when asked about the national controversy during Good Morning America. He added that Americans should “respect people’s ability to act according to their conscience” despite their differences.  “I mean, I’d do it differently,” he added. “I think if you really thought about issues and about this country, you would do it different. ” Kaine appeared more upset about Republican presidential candidate Donald Trump’s decision to go to Mexico on Wednesday and his speech on illegal immigration. “I think it was kind of a diplomatic embarrassment,” Kaine said about Trump’s visit.
