Peter Navarro, economic policy adviser to the Trump campaign, spoke to Breitbart News Daily SiriusXM host Matt Boyle on Friday, saying, “Bad trade deal Hillary has done more damage to the state of Michigan than perhaps any state in the country. So Mr. Trump is going to go into Michigan today, and he’s going to be talking a lot about two deals, in particular. ”[Trump visited Novi, Michigan, Friday, where his emphasis is going to be on trade, according to Navarro.  As for Hillary Clinton, “She’s a pathological liar like her husband,” said Navarro. Referencing the recent debate, he said: The biggest lie she told that night was she denied having called the   Partnership trade deal the gold standard of trade agreements, and there was a flood of   that went on the next day that showed her doing exactly that [lying] repeatedly. “One is the 2012 South Korean deal,” stated Navarro. He added: It’s really a poster child for Hillary Clinton’s incompetence. She was secretary of state in 2012. She crisscrossed this country and Asia telling everybody that this was going to be a   deal, promised us 70, 000 jobs, and here’s what happened: We lost 100, 000 jobs because of that South Korean deal. Our trade deficit has doubled, and, more importantly, 75 percent of the damage that has been caused by that deal has been to the auto industry itself, which, of course, is based in Michigan. Navarro asserted, “Donald Trump’s trade doctrine is simple. Any deal that’s going to be negotiated has to increase our growth, decrease our trade deficit, and strengthen our manufacturing base. The South Korea deal is a perfect example of violating every single one of those rules. ” Concerning Hillary Clinton, “It’s not just the bad trade deals. It’s the con game, and she lies,” said Navarro, pointing out that she and husband Bill ran against NAFTA in 1992 then he signed off on it as president.
