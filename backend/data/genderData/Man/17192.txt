 Starting off my Monday at @TrumpGolfBedminster, hosting our Championship Preview for the 2017 US Women’s Open. I’m with three of the world’s greatest athletes, @CristieKerr, @PaulaCreamer1 and @Brittany1Golf, who gave me a few pointers about smashing a drive (in heels, no less! ). #WorkInProgress, A video posted by Ivanka Trump (@ivankatrump) on May 23, 2016 at 9:10am PDT, Presumptive GOP presidential nominee Donald Trump’s oldest daughter Ivanka Trump posted a video promoting the 2017 Women’s U. S. Open to her Instagram account along with LPGA stars Paula Creamer, Cristie Kerr and Brittany Lincicome. The tournament will be hosted by Trump National Golf Club in Bedminster, NJ.  Trump let 2010 champion Paula Creamer go first, but she then let loose on one in her heels, which left the three LPGA companions impressed. Follow Trent Baker on Twitter @MagnifiTrent
