Pollster Kellyanne Conway, the president of the Ted   Super PAC “Keep the Promise,” explained to Breitbart News Daily what she sees as the Cruz campaign’s   strategy to knock   candidate Marco Rubio out of the primary so that Cruz can have a    race with GOP frontrunner Donald Trump that focuses on “whose brand of conservative populism” can win. [“Cruz wants Trump all to himself,” Conway explained to Breitbart News Daily host and Breitbart Executive Chairman Stephen K. Bannon.  “The belief in the Cruz campaign is you get Trump all to yourself. That’s what I see. I can’t coordinate with them, but that’s what I see  —   what they’re doing,” Conway said, adding: You get Trump all to yourself, and then you make it an argument about whose brand of conservative populism  —   of evangelical conservative populism  —   is the one that carries the nominee forward. Steve, that’s a much healthier debate to have as a movement and as a party than in this corner you have Marco Rubio with the Scarlet E, the establishment favorite  —   all the king’s horses, all the king’s men bucking this guy up even though he can’t win a single state by his own admission including probably his home state of Florida.
