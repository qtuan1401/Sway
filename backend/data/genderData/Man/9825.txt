.@POTUS addresses claims he’s softened his stance on China pic. twitter.  During an interview broadcast on Tuesday’s “Fox  Friends” on the Fox News Channel, President Trump denied that he had softened his stance on China with regards to trade and China being a currency manipulator.  Trump said, “I didn’t soften my stance.   …     Now, what am I going to do, start a trade war with China in the middle of him working on a bigger problem, frankly, with North Korea? So, I’m dealing with China with great respect. I have great respect for him. We’ll see what he can do. Now, maybe he won’t be able to help. That’s possible. I think he’s trying, but maybe he won’t be able to help. ” He added, “What am I going to do, in the middle of him talking with North Korea, I’m going to hit them with currency manipulation? This is the fake media that just does a number.   …     I haven’t changed my stance. China’s trying to help us. I don’t know if they’re going to be able to or not. But, would I want to start heavy, heavy trade or currency statements against somebody that’s out there right now trying to stop what could be a very bad situation?” (  Grabien) Follow Ian Hanchett on Twitter @IanHanchett
