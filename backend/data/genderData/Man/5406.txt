(Want to get this briefing by email? Here’s the  .) Good evening. Here’s the latest. 1. President Obama angrily responded to a speech Monday by Donald J. Trump in which Mr. Trump appeared to broaden his proposal to bar Muslim immigrants. Mr. Obama called the Republican presidential candidate’s comments about the massacre at a gay nightclub in Orlando, Fla. “dangerous. ” Mr. Trump’s appeal to fear breaks with the way most American political leaders have reacted to this kind of crisis, but his stance on guns may help his outreach to   Democrats. _____ 2. Harrowing accounts of the attack, which left 49 people dead, continued to surface: “I look over, and he shoots the girl next to me. And I’m just there laying down and I’m thinking, ‘I’m next, I’m dead,’ ” said Angel Colon, who was shot multiple times. Doctors spoke of bleeding patients lining hospital hallways after arriving in trucks and cars, and on foot. _____ 3. The F. B. I. investigation turned to the second wife of the Orlando gunman, Omar Mateen, to determine whether she had been aware of his plot. The wife, Noor Zahi Salman, is not in custody, but indicated she had accompanied him on one trip to the club and to buy ammunition, and tried to talk him out of waging an attack, a senior law enforcement official said. _____ 4. In France, the killings of a police officer and his companion on Monday by a a   assailant who swore allegiance to ISIS have raised new concerns about radicalization and the handling of people convicted of   activities. The attacker was a Frenchman who was previously found guilty of aiding a group planning terrorist activities, but he was released immediately after his trial ended in 2013. _____ 5. As Hillary Clinton and Bernie Sanders met privately amid the largely inconsequential primary contest in the District of Columbia, the Democratic Party confirmed that Russian hackers had breached the computers of the Democratic National Committee for roughly a year. The targets included the trove of opposition research against Donald J. Trump. _____ 6.   internet can be defined as a utility, a federal appeals court ruled. The decision upheld net neutrality rules by the F. C. C. that signal a shift in how the government views broadband: as a service that should be equally accessible to all Americans, rather than as a luxury. Companies are banned from blocking or slowing the delivery of internet content to consumers, and they’ve indicated they may pursue their case all the way to the Supreme Court. _____ 7. Disney is sharing the keys to the Magic Kingdom with China’s Communist Party  —   at least in Shanghai, where a new resort that will be four times as big as Disneyland opens on Thursday. The   Disney has given the country’s government an unusual role in running the park and, in doing so, has set the pace for how other multinational companies can do business in there. _____ 8. An influential critic’s refusal to review the new “Ghostbusters” film  —   starring women in the lead roles  —   drew more than a million views on YouTube and lots of comments essentially blasting him as a misogynistic jerk. But when our writer dug deeper, he found the reviewer’s positions to be less polarizing than he expected  —   a reminder that, in this age of speedy public judgment, withholding expectations can be worthwhile for all parties. _____ 9. Let’s take a moment to remember the beehive  —   not the insect nest, but the 1960s hairstyle made possible by hair spray, and lots of it. The do’s creator, Margaret Vinci Heldt, died on Friday at 98. Ms. Heldt was an   hairstyling celebrity when she created the look, which was inspired by a black   hat and has never really gone away, even making it onto the heads of Beyoncé and Adele. _____ 10. Lastly, here are a couple of weasels (  ferrets, specifically). They might look cute, but they are also remarkable predators. Badgers, ferrets and otters are part of the mustelid family:   carnivores who are capable of competing for food with much larger predators like big cats, wolves and bears. Maybe it’s time to rethink what it means to call someone a weasel. _____ Jonah Engel Bromwich contributed reporting. _____ Your Evening Briefing is posted at 6 p. m. Eastern.
