On this weekend’s broadcast of “The McLaughlin Group,” conservative commentator Pat Buchanan weighed in on Weekly Standard editor Bill Kristol’s possible   “Never Trump” candidate National Review contributor David French.  Buchanan and the rest of “The McLaughlin Group” panelists dismissed the possibility of French as a serious candidate, with Buchanan adding Kristol was making himself “look ridiculous. ” Partial transcript as follows: MCLAUGHLIN: Who is David French and what impact will his candidacy have? BUCHANAN: He’s Bill Kristol’s candidate and national review I think and “The Weekly Standard”. He’s a very nice fellow. He’s a writer for “The National Review”. Nobody knows who he is. I don’t know that he’s fully committed himself to do this. CLIFT: No. BUCHANAN: And Kristol is making himself look ridiculous. (CROSSTALK) CLIFT: It was a big nothing burger after a lot of tweets about he was going to produce this super credible candidate. ROGAN: Yes. BUCHANAN: Well, I mean  —   MCLAUGHLIN: You know what the movement is? ROGAN: Never Trump. MCLAUGHLIN: Never Trump. How did you know that? BUCHANAN: He didn’t start it. He joined it. I mean, French joined it. He didn’t start it. ROGAN: No, but he’s  —   MCLAUGHLIN: I’m talking Bill Kristol. BUCHANAN: How did that work out? (LAUGHTER) CLIFT: Not very well. PAGE: That’s the problem. I mean, French is a very attractive candidate, except nobody knows who he is. (CROSSTALK) BUCHANAN: He’s a good candidate for Congress, but for president of the United States? ROGAN: And that might be what it is, Tennessee, right? That you might consider  —   MCLAUGHLIN: Will he draw about as many as the Green Party. The Green Party? CLIFT: No, first  —   PAGE: Green Party is better known than he is. I mean  —   (CROSSTALK) CLIFT: They’re not on the ballot anywhere. BUCHANAN: No, and all these deadlines are passing. CLIFT: Exactly. BUCHANAN: You can’t get on in Texas. You only needed about 100, 000 signatures. CLIFT: Or Illinois. He can’t get on Illinois. ROGAN: Look, he’s a very decent man, a combat veteran. But I think it will ultimately, I think Gary Johnson will have much more of formative impact on the outcome of the race. CLIFT: If Gary Johnson were a combat veteran, he’d be Kristol’s choice. I mean, Kristol really wants the military component. ROGAN: That’s  —   PAGE: Besides that, not having  —   but being on the ballot on all 50 states is a big plus for the Libertarians. As you know, Pat, it’s very hard to get on the ballot in any of these states. BUCHANAN: It sure is. PAGE: There’s very little time left. Follow Jeff Poor on Twitter @jeff_poor
