The fake news term #MuslimBan trended on Facebook Monday as people protested President Trump’s executive order to temporarily halt travel to the U. S. from certain countries over security concerns.[ The trending topic compiled the thoughts of people angry at President Donald Trump’s recent executive order which enacted a temporary halt  —   which makes no mention of the Islamic religion  —   to people from Iraq, Iran, Syria, Libya, Somalia, Sudan, and Yemen entering the US until stricter immigration control procedures are put in place.   Many failed to understand the meaning of the immigration halt and bought into the fake news term “#MuslimBan,” created to paint the temporary halt as a religiously motivated attack. Other turned to comic book art to represent their anger: And many other called the halt racism: Of course many that did so failed to actually read the executive order. Breitbart News’ John Hayward compiled a breakdown of facts relating to the temporary immigration halt that demonstrate the executive order is not a blanket ban on Muslims entering the United States: In 2016, following Donald Trump’s stunning election upset of Hillary Clinton, Facebook announced it would begin labeling stories as “fake news” that had been “disputed by 3rd Party ” partnering with partisan outlets like ABC News, Politifact, and Snopes.
