White House Writers Group director Brett Decker tells Breitbart News executive chairman and host Stephen K. Bannon that GOP voters would riot if the party denied the nomination to frontrunner Donald Trump. [Should GOP frontrunner Donald Trump arrive at the convention in Cleveland with dozens of won states and a plurality of the delegates, and the RNC tries to deny him a nomination, the convention would explode, Decker warned on Breitbart News Daily.  “I think the riot inside the convention hall in Cleveland would be bigger than outside on the streets by the ‘Black Lives Matter’ thugs,” he said. “This whole thing  —   you have record numbers showing up this year, and it’s very exciting. ” “There’s a buzz to this primary season. It’s all because people think they have a voice. If the Republican establishment and leaders come in and change the rules, and throw in Paul Ryan or Mitt Romney, it’s them clearly saying: ‘Actually, you don’t have a voice,’” he continued. “I think that’s a very dangerous thing for democracy, but even more so the Republican Party to say, we actually don’t respect that the voters matter. ” Decker adds that, should the Republican party try to assign the nomination, Trump and Cruz would need to come together to put down an establishment coup. I think if something like that happens, you see Trump and Cruz sit down and have a real serious discussion. Because even though the fight’s gotten pretty brutal, at the end of the day, they’re both people that want to turn the table upside down for the establishment, and I think there’s a lot more in common there than there is to disagree with  …     They need to get together and say, between the two of us, we have easily   of the delegates, and let’s cut a deal and make sure this can’t get stolen.
