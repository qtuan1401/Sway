’  ’ ”   Senate Foreign Relations Committee Chair Bob Corker seemed to   needle former Republican presidential nominee Mitt Romney   following the Tennessee Republican’s meeting with     Donald Trump on Tuesday. ” ”   Corker, long considered a contender for secretary of state, said   it’s ultimately Trump’s decision about who will serve in the   post, but that Trump should pick someone who is extremely loyal   to him. ” ’   One of the other top contenders for the job, Romney has come   under fire from top Trump allies, including senior adviser   Kellyanne Conway, for ridiculing Trump throughout the campaign. ’ ’   ”The secretary of state’’s role is so important to a president,”   Corker told reporters after the meeting, according to a pool   report. ”He needs to choose someone that he’’s very comfortable   with and he knows that there’’s going to be no daylight between   him and them. He needs to know that the secretary of state is   someone who speaks fully for the president.” ’ ’   Asked whether Trump told him about a timeline for the decision,   Corker said they ”didn’’t talk about that.” ’ ’’ ’   ”You know, he’’s put together a very rapid and good team rapidly,”   Corker said. ”I think he’’ll make the decision when he’’s   comfortable. My sense is he’’s narrowed it down to a very small   group of people.” ’ ”   Trump’s meeting with Corker came one day after the Manhattan   billionaire met with former CIA Director David Petraeus and hours   ahead of a dinner with Romney, as the drama surrounding the   secretary of state selection reached new heights. ” ’   Corker called the discussion ” ” and said Trump’’s   ”instincts on foreign policy are obviously very good.” ’ ’   ”I know he has a number of outstanding individuals that he’’s   talking with,” Corker said. ”I was glad to be here and glad to   see more fully some of what his views about the world are.” ’
