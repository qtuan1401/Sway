 (CNN) Donald Trump, in the final stretch of last year’s campaign, spelled out what he hoped to accomplish in his first 100 days in office. ”I am asking the American people to rise above the noise and the clutter of our broken politics, and to embrace that great faith and optimism that has always been the central ingredient in the American character. I am asking you to dream big,” Trump said, laying out his plan during remarks in Gettysburg, Pennsylvania. So how has Trump fared? Here’s a status update one where his Contract with the American Voter stands: 6 measures to clean up the corruption and special interest collusion in Washington, FIRST: propose a constitutional amendment to impose term limits on all members of Congress. STATUS: UNFULFILLED. Trump has not proposed such an amendment, though two Republicans in Congress    Sen. Ted Cruz and Rep. Ron DeSantis    proposed such a measure before Trump took office. Trump has not remarked at length about this amendment since taking office. SECOND: a hiring freeze on all federal employees to reduce the federal workforce through attrition  (exempting military, public safety, and public health).  STATUS: FULFILLED, BUT LIFTED. Trump signed an executive action enforcing a hiring freeze in January, but it was lifted a few months later, in April. THIRD: a requirement that for every new federal regulation, two existing regulations must be eliminated.  STATUS: FULFILLED. Trump signed an executive order in January requiring two regulations be eliminated for every new regulation signed. FOURTH: a   ban on White House and congressional officials becoming lobbyists after they leave government service. STATUS: PARTIALLY FULFILLED. Trump signed an executive order placing the lobbying ban on administration officials but not on congressional officials. FIFTH: a lifetime ban on White House officials lobbying on behalf of a foreign government. STATUS: FULFILLED. The same executive order that placed the   ban also prohibited all lobbying on behalf of foreign governments. SIXTH: a complete ban on foreign lobbyists raising money for American elections. STATUS: UNFULFILLED. Trump’s executive order on lobbying did not contain provisions for current foreign lobbyists. 7 actions to protect American workers, FIRST: I will announce my intention to renegotiate NAFTA or withdraw from the deal under Article 2205. STATUS: UNFULFILLED. While Trump still vows to renegotiate NAFTA during public remarks, he has not yet formally begun the renegotiation process. His nominee for US trade representative has not yet been confirmed. SECOND: I will announce our withdrawal from the   Partnership. STATUS: FULFILLED. Trump signed a presidential memo in January withdrawing the US from the TPP. THIRD: I will direct the secretary of the treasury to label China a currency manipulator. STATUS: UNFULFILLED. Trump has reversed course on China’s currency status, telling The Wall Street Journal that China is not a currency manipulator. China was not labeled as such by the Treasury Department in a report this month. FOURTH: I will direct the secretary of commerce and US trade representative to identify all foreign trading abuses that unfairly impact American workers and direct them to use every tool under American and international law to end those abuses immediately. STATUS: FULFILLED. Trump signed an executive order in late March initiating a   review of foreign trade abuses. FIFTH: I will lift the restrictions on the production of $50 trillion dollars’ worth of   American energy reserves, including shale, oil, natural gas and clean coal. STATUS: UNFULFILLED. While Trump signed an executive order promoting American energy, it only ordered a review of current regulations. SIXTH: lift the   roadblocks and allow vital energy infrastructure projects, like the Keystone pipeline, to move forward. STATUS: FULFILLED. Trump signed a presidential memo in January allowing construction of the Keystone XL pipeline and the Dakota Access pipeline to proceed. SEVENTH: cancel billions in payments to UN climate change programs and use the money to fix America’s water and environmental infrastructure. STATUS: UNFULFILLED. While Trump’s budget proposal scrapped UN climate funding, it’s not yet clear which elements of that plan will make it into law. 5 actions to restore security and the constitutional rule of law, FIRST: cancel every unconstitutional executive action, memorandum and order issued by President Obama. STATUS: depends on your view of ’unconstitutional.’ SECOND: begin the process of selecting a replacement for Justice Scalia from one of the 20 judges on my list, who will uphold and defend the US Constitution. STATUS: FULFILLED. Trump’s choice to replace Justice Antonin Scalia, Neil Gorsuch, was confirmed in April and now is the court’s junior associate justice. THIRD: cancel all federal funding to sanctuary cities. STATUS: UNFULFILLED. Trump and his attorney general, Jeff Sessions, have threatened to eliminate Justice Department grants to ’sanctuary cities,’ but cutting off all federal funding to those municipalities would require action from Congress. FOURTH: begin removing the more than two million criminal illegal immigrants from the country and cancel visas to foreign countries that won’t take them back. STATUS: PARTIALLY FULFILLED. Trump signed an executive order expanding authorities for individual ICE agents, but it’s too early to tell if deportations are quickening. FIFTH: suspend immigration from   regions where vetting cannot safely occur. All vetting of people coming into our country will be considered ”extreme vetting.” STATUS: UNFULFILLED. Trump has tried twice to bar entry to citizens from certain   nations, but his executive order remains stalled in court. Legislative proposals, I will work with Congress to introduce the following broader legislative measures and fight for their passage within the first 100 days of my administration: Middle Class Tax Relief and Simplification Act: An economic plan designed to grow the economy 4% per year and create at least 25 million new jobs through massive tax reduction and simplification, in combination with trade reform, regulatory relief and lifting the restrictions on American energy. The largest tax reductions are for the middle class. A   family with two children will get a 35% tax cut. The current number of brackets will be reduced from seven to three, and tax forms will likewise be greatly simplified. The business rate will be lowered from 35% to 15% and the trillions of dollars of American corporate money overseas can now be brought back at a 10% rate. STATUS: NOT INTRODUCED.
