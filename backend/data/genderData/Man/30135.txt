Sunday on ABC’s “This Week,” Sen. Rand Paul ( ) said it is “unrealistic” to expect   Donald Trump to sell off all of his business interests.  Paul said, “You know, I think when people voted for Donald Trump they realized he owned a lot of stuff with his name on it. The concern seems to be higher in the media than the public. People say he has to sell his stuff. How would you possibly sell 700 companies in a fire sale and hope to get what they were worth?” “That’s an unrealistic standard they’re trying to hold him to. He has to do everything he can to set up a firewall between him and his businesses,” he continued. “I think it’s unrealistic for people to say he should sell all of his businesses. It’s not like stock. We have presidents that have put their stock into account and didn’t know what their stock mix is and Donald Trump agreed he would do the same. It’s a little different when you spend 30 years developing all these companies that we just ask him to sell them. I don’t think that’s a fair request. ” Follow Pam Key on Twitter @pamkeyNEN
