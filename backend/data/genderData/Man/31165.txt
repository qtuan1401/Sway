Project Veritas founder James O’Keefe had his Twitter account unlocked after Twitter users bombarded its CEO Jack Dorsey with around 20, 000 tweets, demanding that O’Keefe be reinstated on the platform. [O’Keefe’s account was locked on Wednesday, with Twitter claiming that he had “violated the Twitter Rules,” resulting in him having to “wait some time before using Twitter again. ”  O’Keefe claimed that “Twitter is trying to block our journalism”  —   his organisation, Project Veritas, has in the past exposed Democratic corruption and voter fraud. Before his suspension, he was planning on releasing a video with   footage of a US Senator inside a fundraiser. “We’re too effective —   and there are bombshells coming out all week,” he continued. This week we drop smaller bombs across the country. Next week we drop atomic bombs. https:  .   —   James O’Keefe (@JamesOKeefeIII) October 10, 2016,  O’Keefe told Breitbart News in an email that he was gaining “around 10, 000 followers on Twitter every day in the last few days” so his videos would have an enormous potential audience.
