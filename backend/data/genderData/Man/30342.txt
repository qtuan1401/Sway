A Los Angeles based street artist is posting “No Trump Anytime” parking signs ahead of the California primary, in L. A. and in a handful of other major U. S. cities. [Los   artist Plastic Jesus  —   the man (or woman) behind the “No Kardashian Parking” signs and the     Oscar statuette  —   is back at it again as dozens of the   Trump faux parking signs went up in New York City, Washington, DC, Chicago, Miami and Los Angeles this week, according to the Daily Beast.  ’No Trump Anytime’ signs popping up all over L.

(@PaduRoy) April 27, 2016,  “I considered the effect Trump will have on the whole of the nation. I think it will be a unilateral disaster,” Plastic Jesus told the outlet of the motivation for his latest work. “I’ve been thinking as an artist and a street artist of what I can do in terms of a piece that focuses on Trump. I didn’t want to be frivolous with it. I wanted to find something that would have perhaps a deeper meaning. ” According to Los Angeles ABC affiliate KABC, there are four signs in the greater L. A. area, including one in the trendy Melrose district near La Brea Avenue and Clinton Street. Plastic Jesus’s previous sign creations were classified as vandalism by the Los Angeles Police Department. KABC reports that the Department of Transportation has ordered the signs be taken down. Analyzing Congressional districts across the state, Breitbart California has predicted that Donald Trump will win California’s June 7 Republican primary by a wide margin, though rumblings of a Ted   Kasich strategic partnership could complicate Trump’s bid to lock up the GOP nomination.
