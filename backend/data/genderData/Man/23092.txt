Dallas Mavericks owner Mark Cuban described his “  relationship” with presumptive Republican presidential nominee at a conference in Las Vegas last night. [“There’s that guy who’ll walk into the bar and say anything to get laid,” Cuban contended. “That’s Donald Trump right now to a T. But it’s all of us who are going to get f —  ed. ”  Cuban lauded Trump’s empathy for suffering Americans but criticized him for offering few solutions. He called Trump a friend. Cuban stars on Shark Tank, a   reality show that attempts to fill the void left by The Apprentice. The show enjoys success but has failed to attain the popularity of Trump’s former program. The outspoken NBA owner advises Hillary Clinton to pick a running mate like him. “I would get a   candidate who’s someone like me who would just throw bombs at Donald,” he said at the SkyBridge Alternatives (SALT) event. “And I would be like, ‘Donald, I like you. We’re friends, but you’re a goddamn airhead. ’”
