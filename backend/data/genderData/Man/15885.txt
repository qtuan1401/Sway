  Donald Trump’s team is mocking a CIA intelligence briefing reported by the Washington Post that suggests Russians were secretly working to elect Donald Trump. [“These are the same people that said Saddam Hussein had weapons of mass destruction,” the Trump transition team replied in a statement to reporters, directly challenging the CIA assessment.  But the Trump team also challenged Democrats who are working behind the scenes to highlight the Russian involvement with the election, in what may be an attempt to undermine the validity of the election results. “The election ended a long time ago in one of the biggest Electoral College victories in history,” the statement read. “It’s now time to move on and ‘Make America Great Again. ’” The secret intelligence briefing was provided to members of Congress, after which the details were leaked to the Post. “It is the assessment of the intelligence community that Russia’s goal here was to favor one candidate over the other, to help Trump get elected,” said a “senior U. S. official” who was reportedly “briefed” on the presentation. But some Republicans are challenging the assessment, pointing to a lack of evidence. “I’ll be the first one to come out and point at Russia if there’s clear evidence, but there is no clear evidence  —   even now,” Rep. Devin Nunes ( ) told the Post. “There’s a lot of innuendo, lots of circumstantial evidence, that’s it. ”
