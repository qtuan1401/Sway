  Donald Trump will nominate former Goldman Sachs Partner Steven Mnuchin as the Treasury Secretary in his administration. [Mnuchin served as Trump’s campaign finance chairman early in his presidential campaign and is widely considered to be a Trump loyalist.  After beginning his career at Goldman Sachs in the 1980s, Mnuchin became a partner there before forming his own hedge fund with former Goldman Sachs colleagues in 2004, according to the Wall Street Journal. He also partnered briefly with liberal financier George Soros. He later financed Hollywood films such as James Cameron’s Avatar, American Sniper, Gravity, Suicide Squad, Avatar, and Life of Pi. During the presidential campaign,   News Executive Chairman Stephen K. Bannon questioned Trump in a   Patriot interview whether he was “selling out to Wall Street” by hiring a former Goldman Sachs partner to his campaign. “Well, I needed somebody smart, and he’s very smart, as you know,” Trump replied, explaining why he decided to hire him. “He’s done some amazing deals. I actually did a deal with him in Hawaii I built a hotel with him in Hawaii. He’s great. He’s a good guy. He’s a solid guy, as you know. And you know, the family is a wonderful family. ”
