Matt Drudge is weighing in on the results in Colorado, where Sen. Ted Cruz ( ) received at least 30 of the 37 delegates following the state Republican Party Convention last weekend. [“Does George Bush have to invade Colorado to make it a Democracy? STUNNING Republicans had NO PRIMARY or CAUCUS. At least Dems are faking it!” Drudge posted on Twitter.  Hello Colorado Republicans, even Iraqis get a vote! https:  .  pic. twitter.   —   MATT DRUDGE (@DRUDGE) April 11, 2016,  When Republican party leaders decided not to hold a primary or caucus in Colorado, The Denver Post reported: The Colorado system often favors   candidates who draw a dedicated following among activists  —   as evidenced by Rick Santorum’s victory in 2012 caucus. So the party’s move may hurt GOP contenders such as Donald Trump, Ben Carson and Rand Paul, who would have received a boost if they won the state. During a campaign rally on Monday night, GOP frontrunner Donald Trump called Colorado “a fix” because instead of holding an election, the GOP decided to do it through delegates.
