While Barack Obama’s Justice Department is “fighting efforts to prevent   from voting illegally,” The New York Times reports that the   open borders Spanish language network Univision, which will no doubt serve as a   super PAC for Hillary Clinton this year (Univision is   by Hillary supporter Haim Saban) is launching a massive effort to register millions of new Hispanic voters for the 2016 presidential election.  One of the network’s youngest telenovela stars, William Valdés, 22, will chronicle his becoming a citizen and registering to vote in a video and on social media. And this summer, Univision will hold voter drives near the stadiums hosting the Copa América soccer tournament, and run   announcements during its broadcasts of those matches, which are expected to reach millions.   …     The network insists it is nonpartisan, and says the voter registration drive, targeting the estimated 27 million Hispanics who are eligible to vote, will be agnostic as to political party. Still, 71 percent of Latinos voted for President Obama in the last election cycle, according to the Pew Research Center ’s Hispanic trends studies. Univision is home to the detestable Jorge Ramos, the   anchor who heckled Donald Trump during a press conference last summer.   Follow John Nolte on Twitter @NolteNC
