(Want to get this briefing by email? Here’s the  .) Good evening. Here’s the latest. _____ 1. Funerals began for some of the 41 victims of a suicide bombing at Istanbul’s main airport on Tuesday. The airport also reopened and the city appeared determined to get back to business as usual. Turkey, which faces terrorist threats from both Islamic State militants and Kurdish groups, has endured 14 major attacks in the past year. The government blames the Islamic State for this one, although it has not claimed responsibility. _____ 2. Prime Minister David Cameron of Britain returned to London from a European Union summit meeting, leaving the leaders of the other 27 member countries to discuss Britain’s decision to exit. Candidates to replace Mr. Cameron when he steps down this fall have begun to come forward, and talk of an early general election is growing. Juan Jasso, above, a   who drew attention after video captured him enduring xenophobic insults in Manchester, said he was actually in favor of Britain’s leaving the E. U. _____ 3. There’s one thing Hillary Clinton and Donald J. Trump seem to agree on: toughening trade policies to protect American jobs. The two presidential contenders are deadlocked, according to a new poll, and each has the potential to draw voters from the opposite party. We look at how Mr. Trump has shifted his stances on   issues, usually with few political consequences. _____ 4. Accusations surfaced on Wednesday that the Trump Institute, a   education business to which Mr. Trump lent his name and likeness, plagiarized materials from an obscure real estate manual in 2005. (The institute’s owners were a couple accused of fraud.) The complaint comes as lawsuits from another of Mr. Trump’s forays into   education, Trump University, cast a shadow over his presidential campaign. _____ 5. Mexico, Canada and the United States will use   sources to generate half their electric power by 2025, their leaders announced at a summit meeting in Canada. Marketed as a gathering of the “three amigos,” the meeting of President Obama, Prime Minister Justin Trudeau of Canada and President Enrique Peña Nieto of Mexico also served as a farewell of sorts for Mr. Obama and a debut for Mr. Trudeau. _____ 6. The extradition of the Mexican drug kingpin known as El Chapo has stalled. A lawyer for the drug lord, Joaquín Guzmán Loera, who escaped from prison twice in Mexico, said two appeals filed this week could take years to resolve. The decision to extradite Mr. Guzmán to the United States, where he faces charges in multiple jurisdictions, was made shortly after he was recaptured in January. _____ 7. Changes are coming to your Facebook news feed, and they aren’t good for publishers. (Ahem.) Expect more updates from your friends and family members, and fewer links posted by news media sites. Facebook says it’s concerned that the growth of publisher posts is making it harder for users to connect with people they know. _____ 8. Wimbledon served up a    match on Wednesday, pitting Marcus Willis, who is ranked 772nd, against the   Roger Federer, above right. Federer won. But Willis, who teaches tennis at a boat club in England, captured the hearts of fans and received a standing ovation from the crowd. “It was a pleasure to play against him,” Federer said. _____ 9. William Shakespeare was a social climber. Previously unknown records shed new light on the playwright’s pursuit of a coat of arms on behalf of his father, which would have cemented his own status as a gentleman. They also rebut the idea that Shakespeare wasn’t the author of the works attributed to him. _____ 10. Mermaid schools, which have been teaching girls in the United States how to swim with a tail for quite some time, are spreading to France. The teacher who began classes in that country said 500 people took her introductory course in Marseille, and she has plans to expand. Swim on, mermaids. _____ Your Evening Briefing is posted at 6 p. m. Eastern. And don’t miss Your Morning Briefing, posted weekdays at 6 a. m. Eastern, and Your Weekend Briefing, posted at 6 a. m.
