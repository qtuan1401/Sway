Monday on NBC’s “Today,” GOP nominee Donald Trump campaign manager Kellyanne Conway criticized the Clinton campaign staffers for “gaming the refs” by going on media for the last week and repeatedly saying, “It’s your job to make sure that Donald Trump is   in  . ”  Conway said, “Robby and I are living in parallel universes. I mean, Donald Trump has been criticized all weekend long. I think that the Clinton campaign has clearly been gaming the refs, has been talking to the media for a week now saying, ‘It’s your job to make sure that Donald Trump is   in  .’ I’m just surprised the campaign manager would try to lower expectations that dramatically for his own candidate. But look, they know that campaign debates are not Hillary Clinton’s sweet spot. Yes, she is experienced at doing them but the experience hasn’t necessarily been beneficial. I’ve been asking voters formally, can you name anything from a debate that you have seen in Hillary Clinton that really moved you or you remember and they can’t. She has been in 34 of them. ” (  Newsbusters) Follow Pam Key on Twitter @pamkeyNEN
