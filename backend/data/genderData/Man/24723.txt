Donald Trump’s campaign is calling for the FBI to release additional records on its interview with Hillary Clinton and the investigation into her use of a private, personal email server during her time as secretary of state. [The Trump campaign press release on Monday states that the FBI’s redacted interview notes, which were released late on Friday before the Labor Day weekend, raise questions on whether or not Clinton’s emails, which were under subpoena, had been intentionally destroyed.  “Not only do the FBI’s interview notes underscore Hillary Clinton’s terrible judgment, incompetence, and dishonesty, they raise serious questions about whether emails regarding the terrorist attack in Benghazi were intentionally destroyed while under congressional subpoena,” stated Trump’s deputy campaign manager David Bossie. He continued: According to the FBI’s notes, ‘an intense round of deleting’ began weeks after lawmakers subpoenaed Clinton’s emails following the New York Times report exposing her secret server. Given this timeline and the fact the FBI recovered deleted emails that would have been subject to the subpoena, the FBI should make all of the relevant information surrounding the wiping of Clinton’s server public, including witness accounts from employees of Platte River Networks, which carried out the deletions. “The   is always worse than the crime, and voters have a right to know if these records were illegally destroyed and what role Clinton’s aides may have played,” Bossie concludes. The FBI interview notes with Clinton also reveal that she blamed her concussion on not remembering briefings about how to preserve government information.
