Breitbart Tech and Social Justice Editor Milo Yiannopoulos sang Happy Birthday to the presumptive Republican nominee, Donald Trump, or, as Milo affectionately referred to him in song, “President Daddy. ”  Milo is shown relaxing in a pool in the 30 second YouTube video  —   a length chosen specifically to prevent a mass     spree from divas all across the nation, driven mad by jealousy. The video opens with Milo obscured by shrubbery, a departure from his trademark “I’m ready for my closeup Mr. DeMille” video style, but the shot pans out to see him recalling the elegance of Marilyn Monroe. Milo himself may have been drenched through, but his trademark Newport cigarette remained alight, as nothing could extinguish his natural talent or love for Daddy. Just like his favourite singer Mariah Carey, Milo’s dulcet tones echoed around the area, entrancing all those close enough to be caught up in his   voice. With a glass of wine in one hand and a medallion around his neck, one commenter remarked that the scene could only be better if he was sitting in Mr Trump’s lap while he was singing  —   a perfect 70th birthday gift perhaps. According to local sources, the video is already a hit in the Orlando gay clubbing scene, as at current counts, the video has already surpassed the 13, 000 view mark in mere minutes.
