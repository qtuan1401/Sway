Republican National Committee Chairman Reince Priebus says that GOP frontrunner Donald Trump is surrounded by “varsity” candidates and vows to have an honest convention. But the GOP leader refused to get involved in the debate over whether or not Republican presidential candidate Sen. Ted Cruz ( ) is a “natural born” citizen. [Time asked Priebus, “A topic in the news today Ted Cruz was born in Canada. Is he constitutionally eligible to be President?”  “Listen, I don’t get involved,” Priebus responded. “I’m not going to get in the middle of all these candidate issues. It’s a bad place for me to be. I’ll let all these folks argue about this stuff, and I’m going to stay out of it. ” The debate over whether or not Cruz is a “natural born” citizen and thereby qualified to be President of the United States sparked when Trump told the Washington Post that Cruz’s birthplace could be a “very precarious” issue if Cruz were the GOP nominee. The RNC has not responded to a request for further clarification.
