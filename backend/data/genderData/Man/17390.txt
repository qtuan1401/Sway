The early exit polls show that nearly half of Republican voters (46%) polled today made up their minds today. The same is true for fewer than   of Democrats. This could make the polls in the Republican race, all of which show Donald Trump with wide leads, less reliable than Democrat polls, which showed Bernie Sanders way ahead with Hillary closing a bit.  Per CNN, “Economic issues topped the list of issues in both contests. For the Democrats, the economy and jobs ran evenly with income inequality, with about   citing each as a top issue, while for Republicans, three in 10 cited the economy, and about   each government spending or terrorism. ” The polls also show that the GOP race “centered” on voters “discontent” with the federal government and the Republican Party.
