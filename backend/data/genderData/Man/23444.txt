Breitbart correspondent John Hayward appeared on Breitbart News Daily on SiriusXM Patriot Ch. 125 this morning and discussed the recent gathering of tech moguls and GOP elites at a resort off the coast of Georgia convened to stop presidential candidate Donald Trump.

The guy who melted down live on air because he didn’t get the 2012 election remotely right, he’s going to give them a presentation on how to stop Trump?” he continued. “The guy’s gotta be laughing about this every time he reads an article about it. It’s everything Trump is running against. ” “This is exactly what Trump voters are rebelling against   …     they hate this idea that this oligarchy run the country, that the Democrats and a big chunk of Republicans are in league with each other, that there’s a continuum now between the left and the right in this business class, and they’re going to protect their interests above all else,” Hayward explained. “And they see Trump as the guy who can break all that.
