Fox News Channel’s “Justice” aired an interview between Judge Jeanine Pirro and Donald Trump Saturday, and the presumptive GOP presidential nominee predicted he would be able to unite the people of the United States, unlike President Barack Obama.  “I tell you what, Barack Obama has been a terrible president, but he’s been a tremendous divider. He has divided this country from rich and poor, black and white  —   he has divided this country like no president in my opinion, almost ever,” Trump stated. “The one thing I thought he could do is bring people together, and it turned out to be just the opposite. I will bring people together. ”  Follow Trent Baker on Twitter @MagnifiTrent
