The Number 2 Republican in the Senate told a reporter in Austin, Texas Friday that he supports Donald J. Trump for president because he is the right man for the job. [“It’s going to be an important election because a lot of consequences flow from that, the federal judiciary, the regulatory environment we’re in, whether our economy is going to grow again and jobs are going to be created or not,” said Sen. John Cornyn (R. ) who serves as the GOP Whip in the upper chamber. “I think, for myself, I think he’s a better choice. ”  In April, Cornyn warned Republicans that Trump, who was running against his Texas colleague Sen. Ted Cruz (R. ) could be an albatross around the neck of the party. But, by April Cornyn was telling reporters Trump was the new exciting paradigm. “He could change the electoral map in ways that we haven’t seen before,” he said. “This disrupts the usual Republican versus Democrat, conservative versus liberal paradigm and I just think we don’t know how this will all turn out. ” At the Austin event, the senator was asked if he harbored doubts about Trump and his effect on other state and federal races for other Republicans. “I don’t think there’s any doubt about it, but I’ve been wrong before,” he said. “Who would have predicted this outcome? This is an unusual political environment we’re living in, but not just here in the United States. ” The Texan also pointed out the Democrats are struggling with their own unresolved nomination contest. “Obviously, our Democratic friends are having some challenges on their side with Bernie Sanders,” he said. “That this works is that the party politics, the voters get to choose the nominee and that’s the person who represents the party. ” But, he said with Trump as the nominee on the Republican side of the aisle, it was time for the party to focus on winning back the White House and everything that flows from that victory.
