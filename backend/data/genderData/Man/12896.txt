Sunday on CBS’s “Face the Nation,” Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell, ( ) said   Donald Trump’s hopes to get along with Russia “will be dashed pretty quickly. ”  McConnell said, “I don’t think it is all that unusual for a new president to want to get along with the Russians, I remember George W. Bush having the same hope. My suspicion is these hopes will be dashed pretty quickly, the Russians are clearly a big adversary and they demonstrated it by trying to mess around in our election. ” Follow Pam Key on Twitter @pamkeyNEN
