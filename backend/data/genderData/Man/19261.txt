GOP frontrunner Donald Trump is acting “presidential” as he spends Monday in the nation’s capital, holding a meeting with Republican Congressmen, as well as a press conference and speaking at America’s   Lobby (AIPAC). [Politico and the Washington Post report Trump plans to meet with Congressional leaders, including Sen. Tom Cotton ( ). Lobbyists and political operatives also plan to attend the meeting at his campaign attorney Donald McGahn’s law firm, Jones Day.  Additionally, the real estate mogul will be holding a press conference Monday afternoon at the Old Post Office, soon to be Trump International Hotel Washington, D. C. on Pennsylvania Avenue. He will close out his full day in D. C. with a speech at AIPAC, discussing the Middle East and Israel’s relationship with the United States. Fox News’ Bret Baier also noted Monday morning that Trump will deliver a “scripted” speech at AIPAC, which is rare for the billionaire who tends to deliver    speeches without the use of teleprompters while on the campaign trail.
