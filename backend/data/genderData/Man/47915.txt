’  ’ ’PHILADELPHIA  —   Following a dark and occasionally   rocky Republican convention in Cleveland last week, Democratic   planners . ’ ’   But as raucous protesters shouted over convention speakers and   refused to fully embrace the call for unity, some Democratic   lawmakers began making an argument familiar to audiences watching   the Republican national convention: Think about the Supreme   Court. ’ ”   On Tuesday, Ohio Gov. Ted Strickland predicted that Sen. Bernie   Sanders’ former supporters will coalesce around Hillary Clinton   once they realize that Donald Trump’s election could put several   conservative justices on the court. ” ’   ”If one or two or three or four young, radical conservative   people were placed on that court, everything the Bernie   supporters care about would be at risk,” Strickland told Business   Insider at an event with climate activists. ”If they have a brain   and really thought it through  —   I’’m sure they do have brains,   they’re bright people  —   they would understand the consequences of   pulling back and not getting on board with Secretary Clinton.” ’ ”   Speaking on a panel on Wednesday, Rep. Keith Ellison urged   holdout Sanders supporters to envision what the court would be   like if Al Gore would’ve beaten George W. Bush in the 2000   election, appointing liberal supreme court justices. ” ’’ ’   ”This is a very serious situation that we’’re in,” said Ellison,   one of Sanders’’ most   supporters in Congress. ’ ’   ”The stakes couldn’’t be higher when it comes to the Supreme   Court. From a constitutional standpoint  —   if you supported   Bernie, if you believe in a fair economy, if you believe in   criminal justice . .. then there’’s not way you’’re going to let   Donald Trump become president.” ’ ”   Many Democrats say that raising awareness of Senate Republicans’   refusal to allow hearings to fill the Supreme Court vacancy left   when Supreme Court Justice Antonin Scalia died is a winning   strategy. Hart Research, a polling group that conducts surveys   for   groups, found in a June survey that 50% of   voters said replacing Supreme Court justices was a very important   consideration in their presidential vote, up from 30% in 2012. ” ”   Further, recent surveys conducted by Public Policy Polling showed   that many voters in swing states like Iowa, New Hampshire, and   Pennsylvania don’t trust Trump to fill the vacancy. ” ’   Earlier this year, the Republican presidential nominee released a   list of candidates he would consider to fill the Supreme Court   vacancy. Many Republicans lauded the potential choices, many of   which came straight off a list of potential nominees compiled by   the conservative think tank the Heritage Foundation. ’ ’   For their part, Republicans lukewarm about Trump have justified   their support for the nominee by citing the liberal threat to the   court. ’ ’   In a recent interview with NPR’’s ”Morning Edition,” Senate   Majority Leader Mitch McConnell touted the potential Supreme   Court vacancies as the   issue that ought to change   Republicans’’ minds. ’ ’   ”The single most important thing I would remind      voters in suggesting that they vote for Donald Trump is: Who do   you want to make the next Supreme Court appointment?” McConnell   told NPR. ’ ’   ”Donald Trump has already put out a list of 10 or 11        judges, a list from which he   would pick. I think that issue alone should comfort people in   voting for Donald Trump for president. ’ ’   The majority leader echoed the sentiment in his speech at the   Republican convention in Cleveland. ’ ’   ”Tonight I ask you to continue  —   let us continue our work. Let us   put justices on the Supreme Court who cherish our Constitution,”   . ’
