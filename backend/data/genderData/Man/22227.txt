Thursday immediately following Fox News Channel’s Republican presidential debate in Des Moines, IA, Megyn Kelly, the host of FNC’s “The Kelly File” interviewed Sen. Ted Cruz ( ) one of the participants in the debate.  During that interview, Cruz made a reference to Republican presidential   Donald Trump, who did not attend the debate and instead held a rival event during the debate at nearby Drake University in Des Moines, IA. Cruz cited a conversation he had with Kelly, who has been engaged in a public feud with Trump, before going on air. According to Cruz, Kelly had apparently called Trump “Voldemort. ” “Well, you know, you were joking just before we went on air that it was sort of like Voldermort  —   he who must not be named,” Cruz said. Kelly’s alleged reference was to Lord Voldemort, a fictional character in J. K. Rowling’s “Harry Potter” series and referred to as “ ” “     ” and “the dark lord. ” throughout the series.
