Presumptive Republican nominee Donald Trump renewed his call to ban Muslims from entering the United States from places that have been invaded by terrorists during his speech on Monday afternoon in New Hampshire. [“I called for a ban after San Bernardino, and was met with great scorn and anger but now, many are saying I was right to do so  —   and although the pause is temporary, we must find out what is going on. The ban will be lifted when we as a nation are in a position to properly and perfectly screen those people coming into our country,” Trump explained during his speech addressing the terrorist attack in Orlando, Florida that killed roughly 50 people.  The immigration laws of the United States give the President the power to suspend entry into the country of any class of persons that the President deems detrimental to the interests or security of the United States, as he deems appropriate. I will use this power to protect the American people. When I am elected, I will suspend immigration from areas of the world when there is a proven history of terrorism against the United States, Europe or our allies, until we understand how to end these threats. “After a full, impartial and long overdue security assessment, we will develop a responsible immigration policy that serves the interests and values of America,” he added. “We cannot continue to allow thousands upon thousands of people to pour into our country, many of whom have the same thought process as this savage killer. ”
