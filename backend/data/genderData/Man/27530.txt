Tuesday following the outcome of the Wisconsin GOP presidential primary, Republican National Committee chairman Reince Priebus appeared on Fox News Channel’s “Hannity” to answer questions from host Sean Hannity about the nominating process.  Priebus downplayed any talk of the nominee being someone other than who is still running, including House Speaker Paul Ryan ( ) “Well look, clearly there’s a rule in place that candidates now need a majority of eight states’ delegates  —   eight different states’ delegates, a majority to be even nominated,” Priebus said. “I’ve said it before. It’s not like I’m making news. I believe  —   our nominee’s going to be someone running. And as far as this Paul Ryan talk, let me just say it again for the tenth time: Number one, he’s not running. Number two, he doesn’t want to. Number three, he doesn’t like this talk. He wants it to end. But number four, he’s not going to have a floor operation to do any of these things. It’s ridiculous. ” Priebus outright declared it would be one of the three candidates still in the field, which are Donald Trump, Sen. Ted Cruz ( ) and Gov. John Kasich ( ) “This is what I’ll say: I think our nominees going to be someone who is running and that’s as far as I’m taking it,” he added. “And our nominees going to be someone running   …     I think it’s one of the three people running is going to be our nominee. ” Priebus declined to rule out the possibility of Kasich, who as of today has only won one state, being the nominee and just added he believed that is going to be one of the three candidates remaining.
