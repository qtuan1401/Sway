Sunday in an appearance on Fox News Channel’s “Fox  Friends Weekend,” former Speaker of the House Newt Gingrich ( ) reacted to the mass shooting early Sunday resulting in 50 dead and 53 injured at a night club in Orlando, FL.  Gingrich specifically commented on the reluctance by some to categorize the shooting as Islamic terrorism despite the shooter having been identified as Omar Sateen, a    son of Afghan parents that allegedly had pledged allegiance to ISIS. “The elites in this country are intentionally dishonest,” Gingrich said. “That’s part of why you have the rise of Trump and Sanders. People know that the game is rigged. They don’t want to tell us the truth about the world, they don’t want to tell us the truth about trade deals, they don’t want to tell us the truth about who is getting payoffs in Washington, and they don’t want to tell us the truth about Islamic terrorism. That shouldn’t shock anybody  —   Why would you expect The Washington Post and New York Times to be honest about anything? (  RCP Video) Follow Jeff Poor on Twitter @jeff_poor
