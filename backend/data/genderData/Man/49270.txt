’  ’ ’     Donald Trump on Sunday named Republican National   Committee Chairman Reince Priebus as his chief of staff and   appointed campaign CEO Steve Bannon as chief strategist. ’ ’   ”I am thrilled to have my very successful team continue with me   in leading our country,” Trump said in a statement. ’ ’   The   added: ”Steve and Reince are highly qualified   leaders who worked well together on our campaign and led us to a   historic victory. Now I will have them both with me in the White   House as we work to make America great again.” ’ ’   The move indicated a desire to strike a balance within the White   House of figures who have longtime ties to the   Republican Party, as well as the outsiders who helped propel   Trump to the presidency. ’ ”   CNN  that House Speaker Paul Ryan, Senate Majority Leader   Mitch McConnell, and Trump’s    Jared Kushner urged the     to pick Priebus, who advised Trump closely   following his selection as the Republican presidential   nominee. ” ’’ ’   “It is truly an honor to join   Trump in   the White House as his chief of staff,” Priebus said. ’ ”   Bannon, executive chairman of the   news site   Breitbart News, was also a major contender for the job.
