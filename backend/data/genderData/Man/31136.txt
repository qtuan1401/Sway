And are you worried that your past will hurt your wife’s campaign?” “I don’t have a response,” Clinton said. “If he wins the Republican nomination we will have plenty of time to talk about it. “I have no interest in getting involved in politics or doing anything except trying to help Hillary,” Clinton added, (  RCP Video) Follow Jeff Poor on Twitter @jeff_poor
