Less than a week before Election Day, a homeless woman guarding Trump’s star from   vandals was harassed and assaulted by a group of   protesters. The star had also previously been defaced with graffiti and swastikas. The day after Trump won the election, his fans gathered around the Hollywood star to celebrate his historic victory over Hillary Clinton. TMZ reported in late November that the star would be subject to “Secret Service” level of protection.   Follow Jerome Hudson on Twitter @jeromeehudson
