’  ’ ’   Retired US Army Gen. Barry McCaffrey slammed President Donald   Trump’’s defense of Russian President Vladimir Putin on Monday,   calling it ”the most   statement ever made by the   president of the United States.” ’ ’   In  Trump seemed to   defend Putin when O’’Reilly called him a ”killer” by saying that   the US has ”made a lot of mistakes” as well. ’ ’   ”We’’ve got a lot of killers,” Trump said. ”Boy, you think our   country’’s so innocent? You think our country’’s so innocent?” ’ ”   McCaffrey blasted Trump’s statement. ” ’   ”I’’m actually incredulous that the president would make a   statement like that,” McCaffrey told MSNBC on Monday. ”One could   argue that’’s the most   statement ever made by   the president of the United States.”  ’ ’   He continued: ”To confuse American values with Putin, who’’s   running a criminal oligarchy, who kills people abroad and at   home, who imprisons journalists and takes away business property,   who shares it with his former KGB agents, who invades and seizes   Crimea and eastern Ukraine  —   this is an astonishing state of   affairs.” ’ ’   Trump has often been criticized for his praise of Putin. He told   O’’Reilly that he respects Putin, but also said that doesn’’t mean   he’’ll get along with the Russian leader. But he said ”it’’s better   to get along with Russia than not.” ’ ’ ’ ’WATCH: Gen.
