Ted Cruz. ISIS doesn’t just target soldiers. They don’t just target Republicans. Or Jews. They also target Christians and fellow Muslims. They target each and every one of us. As we saw this morning, they target the gay and lesbian community. Their objective, which they broadcast worldwide, is to murder or forcibly convert every single American.

I just moved to Orlando a year ago, and I left New York for a lot of reasons, [it] being dangerous, and the economy  —   everything over there was just horrible, and I just came over here, and now we have to deal with this,” she said. “It’s scary as hell and I don’t even know where to put myself.
