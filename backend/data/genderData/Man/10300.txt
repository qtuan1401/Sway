While rolling back onerous   environmental and business regulations, President Donald Trump has also been quietly dropping gun controls which were either put in place or at least prolonged by the Obama administration. [On February 28 Breitbart News reported that Trump signed the repeal of Obama’s Social Security gun ban  a ban which empowered the Social Security administration to strip away the Second Amendment rights of Social Security beneficiaries without due process. Days later, Trump’s Interior Secretary Ryan Zinke squashed Obama’s lead ammunition ban for federal lands and waters.  According to McClatchy, Trump’s administration has been quietly working to do away with other   firearm regulations as well. For example, “agencies narrowed the definition of ‘fugitive’” which, in turn, limits the number of people barred from gun possession because they are included in a fugitive database. Additionally, Trump “officials have also signaled that they may no longer defend the Army Corps of Engineers’ ban on carrying loaded firearms and ammunition on federal lands. ”
