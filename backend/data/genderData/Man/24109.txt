Like millions of Americans watching at home across the country, Hollywood celebrities were glued to their Twitter accounts Monday night during the first presidential debate between Democrat Hillary Clinton and Republican Donald Trump  —   and emotions ran high during the showdown. [In a highly contentious debate that was light on important policy issues like immigration and terrorism, outspoken celebrity Trump critics including Sarah Silverman, Bill Maher, Kerry Washington, Lena Dunham, Patton Oswalt, Shonda Rhimes and Michael Moore all hit Twitter to register their displeasure with the Republican candidate’s performance (though the latter grudgingly admitted that Trump “won” the contest).  Prolific   tweeters like Katy Perry, Elizabeth Banks, Debra Messing and Cher praised their candidate’s performance, while conservative actor James Woods tweeted in support of Trump. Below is a sampling of debate reaction from Hollywood’s best and brightest. There was no shortage of hate for Trump: Surreal, like watching a reasonable person who got into a fender bender with a    and is suddenly being shrieked at on La Cienaga.  —   Lena Dunham (@lenadunham) September 27, 2016,   Y’all watching those dem debates?

But we still have to work HARD to ensure his BS doesn’t win.  —   olivia wilde (@oliviawilde) September 27, 2016,  #trumpedup #imwithher #firstpresidentialdebate2016 #imfuckinscared #HClookinbeauty #speakinbeauty #LOVE #VOTE #debates @HillaryClinton pic. twitter.   —   Miley Ray Cyrus (@MileyCyrus) September 27, 2016,  i wish she would call him out on his blatant racism, but i guess we are rolling with the ”when they go low, we go high” thing.  —   christine teigen (@chrissyteigen) September 27, 2016,  Wow.

He just said i settled that lawsuit with no admission of guilt..  —   Whoopi Goldberg (@WhoopiGoldberg) September 27, 2016,  Yeah. Trump has great relations with the African American community.  And I just blew a Martian.  —   Albert Brooks (@AlbertBrooks) September 27, 2016,  The arrogance of this man is stunning in its brazenness, and sad in its utter lack of humanity.  —   George Takei (@GeorgeTakei) September 27, 2016,  Trump is now fact checking against reality. We have now entered the hell tunnel in Pure Imagination in Willy Wonka,  —   Josh Gad (@joshgad) September 27, 2016,  While Clinton’s celebrity defenders came to her aid: She’s smiling with ease cause #shesgotthis #ImWithHer #debatenight,  —   KATY PERRY (@katyperry) September 27, 2016,  Clinton understands systemic racism is nuanced  needs to be tackled on every level.

Democrats care about the inner cities at election time. After that. Zero.  —   James Woods (@RealJamesWoods) September 27, 2016,  Meanwhile, some stars were unhappy with the way NBC anchor Lester Holt was moderating the proceedings: Someone should check on Lester Holt. #Debates,  —   Chelsea Handler (@chelseahandler) September 27, 2016,  Why does Trump keep interrupting?

Fellow Bernie voters  —   admit it, there’s nothing she’s said we disagree with. In fact, she’s adopted his positions!  —   Michael Moore (@MMFlint) September 27, 2016,  It’s over. Trump, the egoist, the racist, the narcissist, the liar, ”won.” We all lost. His numbers will go up. She told the truth. So what.  —   Michael Moore (@MMFlint) September 27, 2016,  If u just turn off the TV right now and do nothing, you’ve just elected Donald Trump. Do something! Plan what you’re going to do tomorrow.  —   Michael Moore (@MMFlint) September 27, 2016,    Follow Daniel Nussbaum on Twitter: @dznussbaum
