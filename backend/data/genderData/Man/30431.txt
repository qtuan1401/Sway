Wednesday on ABC’s “The View,” while promoting his latest film, “‘Nocturnal Animals,”   fashion designer and film director Tom Ford said he would prefer not to dress incoming first lady Melania Trump because she was “not necessarily” his image.  When asked if he would dress Melania, Ford said, “I was asked to dress her quite a few years ago and I declined   …     She’s not necessarily my image. Also the first lady  —   other than the fact that I’m a Democrat and voted for Hillary and very sad and disappointed that she’s not in office  —   but other than that, even had Hillary won, she shouldn’t be wearing my clothes. They’re too expensive. And I don’t mean this in a bad way —   they’re not artificially expensive, it’s how much it cost to make these things. But I think to relate to everybody —  ” When asked why then he dressed Michelle Obama, Ford said, “Michelle I dressed once when she was going to Buckingham Palace for dinner with the Queen, and I thought it was appropriate. I live in London, so that made sense. And it was an honor to dress her. ” Follow Pam Key on Twitter @pamkeyNEN
