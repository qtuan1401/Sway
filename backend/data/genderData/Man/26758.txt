A new   poll shows Hillary Clinton losing ground to Donald Trump. [From Reuters:  Democratic presidential hopeful Hillary Clinton’s lead over Republican Donald Trump has dipped into the single digits among likely U. S. voters for the first time in nearly two weeks, according to a   poll released on Friday. The June   1 poll showed a 9. 4 percentage point lead for the former secretary of state over the New York businessman, down slightly from an 11. 2 point lead in a previous   poll that ended on June 28. Clinton had maintained a   lead in the rolling poll since June 20, as she recovered from a brief boost in Trump’s numbers in the wake of the mass shooting in Orlando, Florida, when he renewed a call for a ban on Muslim immigration. Among likely voters, 43. 9 percent now support Clinton, compared with 34. 5 percent for Trump. Another 21. 7 percent of likely voters wouldn’t support either candidate.
