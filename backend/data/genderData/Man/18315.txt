While reacting to concerns about the immigration status of GOP presidential nominee Donald Trump’s wife, Melania Trump, Democratic strategist Simon Rosenberg said that being an illegal immigrant is not a crime in the United States.  “The truth is, we don’t know what happened,” Rosenberg said. “They have to release the immigration file. It’s the only way we’re really going to know, but based on what we know, it is possible that what she has done is far worse that what an undocumented immigrant does. Being undocumented in the U. S. is not a crime. What she has done could be a felony. She could lose her citizenship. ” Follow Trent Baker on Twitter @MagnifiTrent
