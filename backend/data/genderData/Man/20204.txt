Would you like to win a signed Breitbart Border Construction Co.   as modelled by yours truly and the Queen of Conservative Media, Ann Coulter? Of course you would. Here’s how. [Take the image above and decorate it however you please. You could add lovely glittery T’s for Trump, you could add slogans, memes from 4chan  …     you can do whatever you want.  Tweet it with #FabulousWall and you could win a free shirt signed by this glamorous blonde model and have your work featured on Breitbart. com. Currently the Breitbart Store only ships shirts to the United States  —   so, if you’re outside the US, this is your best shot at getting one of these limited edition beauties.
