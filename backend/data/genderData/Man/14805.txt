A little more than a year and a half from now, the referendum, the first referendum on Donald Trump will come forward. this vote they are asking their members to take is a terrible terrible vote for them. Even if the bill is changed in the Senate which the president is saying ‘Oh it will be changed, it will be changed.’ They are still accountable for the vote they took in the house. 24 million off of  —   a 600 billion dollar transfer of wealth. But more importantly than that is what does this mean to individuals? What does this mean to a person?
