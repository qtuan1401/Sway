Thursday on Newsmax TV discussing President Donald Trump’s positions on NATO and China, which some have argued is a departure from his campaign messaging, Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell ( ) said, “I think he’s learning the job. ”  McConnell said, “I think President Trump is learning the job and some of the things that were said during the campaign I think he now knows that’s simply not the way things ought to be. ” He continued, “There is nothing wrong with the president. In fact, I welcome adjustments that he makes from the campaign. A lot of things are said in the campaign by candidates that turn out to be not the way it works when you are actually in office. ” He added, “I can’t think of a single candidate who hasn’t changed their mind once being elected president. ” (  The Hill) Follow Pam Key on Twitter @pamkeyNEN
