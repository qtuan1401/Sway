Donald Trump said that Hillary Clinton should never have been allowed to run for president due to her crimes and   advocacy. [“Anyone who supports open borders should never be allowed to be president,” Trump said. “Hillary’s plan includes an open border with the Middle East  …    most people don’t even know where [refugees are] going, including governors and senators. This is going to be the great Trojan horse. ”  “I’m going to keep radical Islamic terrorists the hell out of our country!” Trump said. “She has opened the door to unlimited drugs pouring into your community. Which Ohio does not want,” Trump said. Trump vowed that his administration will make America wealthy again. “We’re going to save your Social Security. Hillary is going to cut it. We’re leaving it the way it is. Because that was the contract” you made with the government, Trump said. “Hillary Clinton lied so many times, nobody can even count that high,” Trump declared as the crowd chanted, “LOCK HER UP! LOCK HER UP! LOCK HER UP!”
