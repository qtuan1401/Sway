The Obama administration spent more than $77 million to promote Obamacare in 2016, the New York Post reported. [Contracts obtained by the Post show that the federal government had a contract with   PR firm Weber Shandwick, where the government paid the firm $74. 15 million on July 28, 2016, and an additional $3. 69 million on September 9, 2016, to promote the plan.  Of that money, $64 million went to radio, television, and digital  $4 million went to creative development and production $5 million to direct response marketing $2 million to campaign strategy $1 million to branding and $1. 5 million to encourage small business enrollment. An official from the Trump administration dismissed the efforts of the Obama administration to make a   effort to boost enrollment. “Tens of millions in   taxpayer funds spent on TV ads won’t sell a fundamentally flawed approach to health care,” the official told the Post. Pam Jenkins, president of Weber Shandwick, signed the contract. Obama selected the firm’s chairman, Jack Leslie, to be chairman of the U. S. African Development Foundation. Leslie donated $1, 000 to former President Barack Obama’s 2012   campaign and $2, 700 to Hillary Clinton’s failed presidential bid. On Monday, President Trump met with nine people who have suffered from the healthcare law’s high costs, telling them that he would put in its place a better plan that would “lower costs” and “expand choice. ” Health and Human Services Secretary Tom Price said Sunday that “nobody would be worse off financially” if Republicans in Congress made an effort to repeal and replace Obamacare with the House replacement plan.
