 (CNN) Put Emma Stone on the growing list of celebrities who are having trouble processing the results of the presidential election.  Last Tuesday, Hollywood was quick to jump into the post election conversation on social media after Donald Trump was declared  . But Stone, who is not on social media, joined the chorus of the disappointed while speaking to CNN this weekend at the 8th Annual Governors Awards hosted by the Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences.  RELATED: Hollywood expresses shock, disappointment after voting results, Stone, star of Oscar favorite ”La La Land,” admitted the results were ”incredibly painful.” But she also sees the loss of Hillary Clinton as ”galvanizing.”  ”I think it’s a real wake up call and chance for us to all unite and do the very, very best we can to speak out and be brave,” she said.  Stone’s statements were echoed by many at the award show, during which Jackie Chan was given an honorary Oscar.  Stone’s ”La La Land” director Damien Chazelle said he was ”still in a little bit of a   state,” but ”trying to keep hopeful.”  ”If us artists here keep making our art and making stuff and stay creative and stay productive, that’s my way of coping. And maybe that can actually help,” he said.  CNN’s Sarah Moon contributed to this story.
