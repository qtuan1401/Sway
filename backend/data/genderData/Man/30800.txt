The commission on presidential debates admits there were problems with Donald Trump’s audio during his first presidential debate with Hillary Clinton. [“Regarding the first debate, there were issues regarding Donald Trump’s audio that affected the sound level in the debate hall,” the Commission on Presidential Debates say in a carefully worded email to reporters.  After finishing the debate, Trump insisted in the spin room that his microphone was “defective. ” “They gave me a defective mic!” he told reporters, speculating whether it was “on purpose. ” When Clinton was asked about Trump’s complaint, she dismissed it as proof he flunked his first debate. “Anybody who complains about the microphone is not having a good night,” she said to reporters.
