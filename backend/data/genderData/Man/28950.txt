S. history. “The point of the hat was to say America needs changing and improvement,” Lake told the Staten Island Advance. “I don’t think it’s a positive message to say, “Let’s look to the past. ’” The lifelong New Yorker said she was surprised when she awoke Wednesday morning to see a tsunami of calls and texts messages from friends and   asking if she had noticed the firestorm her hat had created. “Everyone kept asking me if I was on Facebook or Twitter, which I hadn’t been,” she said, “and then I saw how many people were sharing [the picture] and that it was going viral. “I was honestly shocked  —   I didn’t expect any of this to happen,” Lake added.

For its part, Home Depot didn’t waste time responding to critics on Twitter and Facebook.

Whether or not Lake has been punished for breaking company rules, Holmes told Business Insider, “The management team addressed it with her. ” “I’m not going to be specific other than to say that if any associate refuses to follow any of our policies, it can lead to termination,” he added.
