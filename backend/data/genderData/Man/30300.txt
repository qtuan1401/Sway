Monday on MSNBC, former Democratic National Committee chairman and former Gov. Howard Dean ( ) said Republican presidential nominee Donald Trump’s outreach to minority voters will fail because he lacked the “conception” of knowing what a racist is “because he is one. ”  Dean said, “Well, let me tell you how incredibly incredibly incompetent Donald Trump is on the race issue. He goes to a black church and I think people probably are not going to vote for him but appreciate it. And then he tweets this morning that because Barack Obama has been such a bad president, there won’t be another black president for many years. I mean, unbelievable. You reach out to a group one day and the next day you trash their president, their person they care about. And then say that all black people are tainted with the same problem. This is insane! He has no conception of what being a racist is, because he is one. I  mean, it’s just  —   I don’t think he’s a terrible racist that wears a hood. He just has no clue about what he’s talking about. ” Follow Pam Key on Twitter @pamkeyNEN
