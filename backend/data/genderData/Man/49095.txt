’  ’ ’  ’ ’     Few of these stories were bad, but most of them suffered from     the same blind spot: race. In telling the story of the white     workers who backed Trump, they missed the perspective of the     black ones who rejected him. This is important. Without that     perspective, you risk downplaying the consequences of Trump     support —  not for supporters, but for the groups Trump has     targeted throughout his campaign. Empathy without clarity leads     to a place where Trump’s material threat to nonwhites —  “stop and     frisk,” mass deportation, Muslim surveillance, etc. —  is treated     as incidental to the story of Trump and his support, when it’s     the opposite.   ’ ’     One outlet managed to convey that nuance the other night.     Improbably, it was Saturday Night Live. Political     humor is old hat on Saturday Night Live, but it’s rare     to see anything with real subtlety or sophistication. In     general, we get caricatures and impressions —  exaggerated     renderings of individuals, ideas, and events. Occasionally,     those renderings are so brilliant that they add something to     our larger understanding of a particular politician. Most     times, they aren’t and they don’t.   ’ ’     This past Saturday, however, SNL struck gold with one     of its sharpest political sketches in recent memory. Instead of     Kate McKinnon doing her   bit as Hillary Clinton     or Alec Baldwin playing the fleshy id of Donald Trump, we had     three ordinary people as contestants on “Black Jeopardy!” a     recurring bit on the show. Kenan Thompson played the host, with     Leslie Jones and Sasheer Zamata as two of the three     competitors. The third was Doug, played by Tom Hanks wearing a     denim shirt, graying facial hair, and a red “Make America Great     Again” hat, and speaking as if through a freshly applied hunk     of Skoal. In past versions of the sketch, the white contestants     are too tied to their whiteness and their political correctness     to accurately answer questions about black cultural tropes and     stereotypes, which is to say that these bits are typically     little more than refurbished Sinbad jokes.   ’ ’  ’ ’  ’ ’         ’ ’  ’ ’       By this point, the message is clear. On this episode of       “Black Jeopardy!” the questions are rooted in feelings of       disempowerment, suspicion of authority, and         identity —  experiences that cut across racial lines. Thompson       and the guests are black, but they can appreciate the things       they share with Doug, and in turn, Doug grows more and more       comfortable in their presence, such that he gets a “pass”       from the group after he refers to them as “you people. ” That       moment is funny, but it also foreshadows the end of the       sketch, where this message of commonality —  even solidarity —  is       tweaked and made more complicated.     ’ ’       “Doug, I have to say it’s been a pleasure,” says Thompson as       the sketch comes to an end. “Well, right back at you my       brother,” says Hanks.     ’ ’       “All right, well, let’s take a look at our Final Jeopardy       category,” announces Thompson, “ ‘Lives That Matter.’ ”     ’ ’       Jones and Zamata turn to look skeptically at Hanks’       character, while Thompson laughs and gives the punchline.       “Well, it was good while it lasted, Doug. ” To which Hanks       says, “I have a lot to say about this. ” And then the sketch       comes to a close.     ’ ’       Because the bulk of the sketch is this humanizing          between Doug, the black host, the black       contestants, and the black audience, it’s easy to read the       message as a plea for tolerance and understanding.       There’s more that unites us than there is that divides       us. You can even add a class analysis: Black       Americans share more than just common culture with some Trump       supporters; they share common interests. There are       important limits to this, beyond the universe of       SNL: Because of its roots in the South, black       culture shares an affinity with the rural white life that       Doug represents. It’s not clear this would exist between,       say, a black audience and a   professional       from outside Milwaukee. But at this point, the sketch’s       argument seems barely implicit: We need to work together       instead of pitting ourselves against each other.     ’ ’  ’ ’       Then comes the final punchline, “Lives That Matter. ”       Obviously, the answer to the question is “black. ” But Doug       has “a lot to say about this. ” Which suggests that he doesn’t       think the answer is that simple. Perhaps he thinks “all lives       matter,” or that “blue lives matter,” the phrasing used by       those who defend the status quo of policing and criminal       justice. Either way, this puts him in direct conflict with       the black people he’s befriended. As viewers, we know that       “Black Lives Matter” is a movement against police violence,       for the essential safety and security of black Americans.       It’s a demand for fair and equal treatment as citizens, as       opposed to a pervasive assumption of criminality.     ’ ’         Thompson, Zamata, and Jones might see a lot to like in         Doug, but if he can’t sign on to the fact that black         Americans face unique challenges and dangers, then that’s         the end of the game. Tucked into this   sketch is         a subtle and sophisticated analysis of American politics.         It’s not that working blacks and working whites are unable         to see the things they have in common; it’s that the         material interests of the former —  freedom from unfair         scrutiny, unfair detention, and unjust killings —  are in         direct tension with the identity politics of the latter (as         represented in the sketch by the Trump hat). And in fact,         if Hanks’ character is a Trump supporter, then all the         personal goodwill in the world doesn’t change the fact that         his political preferences are a direct threat to the lives         and livelihoods of his new friends, a fact they recognize.       ’ ’         Now, this sketch isn’t some exercise in didacticism. It’s         genuinely funny with great performances from everyone         involved. But it does make a firm statement about our         political world: that racism is a huge obstacle to a kind         of class solidarity. And that, as long as   Dougs         hold on to their identity politics, that obstacle         will remain.       ’
