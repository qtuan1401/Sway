Actor Cuba Gooding Jr. came under fire on social media Sunday night and Monday morning after he appeared to lift up his American Horror Story   Sarah Paulson’s dress during a PaleyFest panel Sunday.

Reminder: This is Trump’s America.  —   Eyounguns (@AunteeYo) March 27, 2017,  In the photo, Paulson appears to be laughing while Gooding Jr. looks like he’s lifting up her dress. The event took place on Sunday at the Dolby Theater in Los Angeles. Also in attendance at the panel were Kathy Bates, Denis O’Hare, Cheyenne Jackson, Adina Porter and more, who spoke about the upcoming season of the show. During the panel, Paulson was asked which of her AHS characters she’d like to see come back. “Probably [Coven‘s] Cordelia. We only got to see her just getting her powers. I just would like to know  …     if the power might have been something that kind of changed her,” she said. American Horror Story creator Ryan Murphy was not present for the panel. The FX show’s stars, which included Denis O’Hare, Cheyenne Jackson, and Adina Porter, discussed past seasons but didn’t offer clues or tidbits for the forthcoming season 7 premiere. The upcoming season is expected to revolve around the 2016 presidential election. Paulson told the Hollywood Reporter on Saturday that she would like to play Donald Trump on the upcoming season of the show, though Murphy has previously said neither Trump nor Clinton would appear as characters. “Why not? That’s an acting challenge to be sure,” she said.   Follow Jerome Hudson on Twitter: @JeromeEHudson
