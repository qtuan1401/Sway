Michigan has one of the largest Muslim populations of any state, yet 6 out of 10 Republicans in the state favored a temporary ban on Muslim visitors to the United States, according to early exit poll results from CNN. [The proposal  —   championed by Republican frontrunner Donald J. Trump  —   was even more popular in Mississippi, where 7 out of 10 Republicans favored a ban on Muslim travel. Those proportions match the range of responses among the states that voted a week ago on Tuesday, ranging from 64% (Virginia) to Alabama (78%).  The exit polls confirm recent public polling results, such as a WXYZ   Free Press poll that showed 61% support in Michigan for a ban on Muslims. Local Muslims in Michigan reacted with concern at the poll results. The exit poll results bode well for Trump, who is thought to be facing a fairly strong challenge in Michigan from Ohio Gov. John Kasich.
