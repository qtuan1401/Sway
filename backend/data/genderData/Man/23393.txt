On Wednesday’s broadcast of MSNBC’s “Rachel Maddow Show,” Clinton Campaign Manager Robby Mook stated, “it’s only fitting for a bully like Trump to hire a bully to run his campaign. ”  Mook said that “[W]e hear rehashed conspiracy theories, we don’t hear very much at all about what he’s going to do to actually make people’s lives better,” from Trump. “And he doubled down on this today by appointing someone to lead his campaign who makes these conspiracy theories basically his professional mission. So, yes, we are going to hear more of this. It’s very disturbing, but I think it’s only fitting for a bully like Trump to hire a bully to run his campaign. ” He added, “I think the campaign’s going to be more unpredictable. I think we’re going to see more conspiracy theories out there. I don’t think we’re going to see Trump become more serious, become more presidential.   …     I think what we’re seeing in this is him doubling down on his smallest, most divisive, most hateful inclinations, and, so, I think it’s going to be more of the same. It’s probably going to be worse of the same. ” Follow Ian Hanchett on Twitter @IanHanchett
