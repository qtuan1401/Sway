Wednesday on CNN’s “Newsroom With Brooke Baldwin,” referencing Republican presidential candidate Donald Trump writing about extramarital affairs in his book, “The Art of the Deal,” Republican Sen. Ben Sasse ( ) took aim at Trump’s personal life.  Sasse said, “We are talking about oaths. In a system of  government that is limited, we believe that oaths are really important because you are taking an oath to fulfill a specific office. So a lot of the media want to make a thing about whatever sexual scandal, this, that, or other thing. Here’s the question I’m asking, isn’t it pretty weird for a guy to brag about trying to get married women to break their oaths? I think that’s weird. There is a difference in life between saying we all make mistakes and we are imperfect. I believe that. Mythology has me chief of sinners. That’s a different thing than saying it’s really cool to break an oath. I care about whether or not the guy who is going to be our next president takes an oath to the Constitution and believes that oath binds him. ”
