’  ’ ’   President Donald Trump called a shooting incident in the   Philippines a ”terrorist attack” on Wednesday, before officials   made any such determination about the nexus of the incident. ’ ’   ”I would like to begin by addressing the terrorist attack in   Manila,” Trump said at the start of his speech. ”It is really   very sad as to what’’s going on throughout the world with terror.   Our thoughts and our prayers are with all of those affected,”   Trump said as he prepared to announce his plan to withdraw from   the Paris climate agreement on Thursday. ’ ”   However, a Philippines’ police chief said that there was no   indication that the incident was related to terrorism, and   instead, believed that the lone gunman was attempting to rob the   gaming resort in the Philippine capital of Manila, Reuters   reported. Authorities say that the gunman had set some tables on   fire and that people in the room were not targeted. ” ’   ”We cannot say this is an act of terror . .. he did not hurt   anyone,” he said. ”If you are a terrorist you will sow terror.” ’ ’   One US official  that Trump was   ”freelancing” when he associated the incident with terrorism and   said that ”a laugh went up in the Situation Room” afterwards. ’ ’   Meanwhile, US intelligence officials  declined   to label the incident a terrorist attack, saying that it was far   too early to draw conclusions. ’ ’President Donald Trump called a shooting. ..’ ’’ ’’ ’’
