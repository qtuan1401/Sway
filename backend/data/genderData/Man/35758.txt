Washington (CNN) Vermont Sen. Bernie Sanders appeared to admit defeat to Hillary Clinton in the fight for the Democratic presidential nomination Wednesday. ”It doesn’t appear that I’m going to be the nominee,” Sanders said in an interview on  .  Sanders continued to campaign through the final primary election    which was held in Washington, D. C. last week    despite Clinton clinching the needed number of pledged delegates the prior week.  After losing to Clinton in D. C. Sanders spoke to supporters in a web address and pledged to continue his campaign’s fight to the convention, but also vowed to help Clinton defeat Donald Trump.  ”I personally intend to begin my role in that process in a very short period of time,” Sanders said during his June 16 speech.  Sanders still has not endorsed Clinton as the Democratic nominee.  ”We are trying to do nothing less than transform the Democratic party,” Sanders said during his   interview. ”The bottom line is, and this is a very difficult decision for the establishment in the Democratic party to have to deal with, do they open the door? Millions of people would like to participate in the political process. Or do they say, ’Sorry, this is our party. ’”
