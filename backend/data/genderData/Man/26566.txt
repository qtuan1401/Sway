Clinton Cash author and Breitbart News Senior    Peter Schweizer has a message for billionaire provocateur Mark Cuban, who tweeted out a bogus   article against Schweizer’s bestselling book by the   blog Media Matters. [Clinton Cash Author Peter Schweizer’s Long History Of Errors, Retractions, And Questionable Sourcing https:  .   —   Mark Cuban (@mcuban) July 26, 2016,   Cuban’s Twitter tirade Tuesday started with the Dallas Mavericks owner taking swipes at Donald Trump. Cuban tweeted “@realDonaldTrump‘s misleading claim about Clinton Foundation, Russia and    politics,” which linked to a shoddy “ ” from politifact. com. Cuban, however, failed to tweet the   explosive New York Times front page story confirming Schweizer’s Uranium One Russia revelations. In fact, Cuban failed to tweet the dozens of mainstream media coverage confirming the reporting found on the pages of Clinton Cash. Had Cuban commenced even a cursory Google search, he would’ve have come across Clinton   stories in The New Yorker, The Wall Street Journal, The New York Times  The Washington Post, or CBS News, and ABC News.  While it’s unclear what actually sent Cuban on his social media screed, Peter Schweizer told Breitbart News that he isn’t interested in “playing 140 character pattycake on Twitter. ” “Let’s have a real honest to goodness debate,” Schweizer said in an email to Breitbart Tuesday. “What do you think, Mark Cuban? I’ll debate the facts any place, any time. You pick the place: MSNBC, NPR, Breitbart Radio. You pick it and I’ll show up,” Schweizer said. Follow Jerome Hudson on Twitter: @jeromeehudson
