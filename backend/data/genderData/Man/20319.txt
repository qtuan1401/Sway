Hillary Clinton’s holiday party at a posh New York City hotel was described as a very solemn affair by some of the party’s attendees just more than a month after her election loss to   Donald Trump. [“It was like a wake with a band,” quipped one guest at the Plaza Hotel affair to the New York Post’s Page Six. The holiday party included   donors, VIP boosters, and campaign advisers.  The source added that “it was a little bit of group therapy and a lot of love” among the losing Democratic rainmakers. Even Clinton herself looked quite glum as she arrived at her holiday party, with other party attendees like Vogue    Anna Wintour dodging cameras, the Daily Mail reported. Clinton advisers Huma Abedin, John Podesta, and Robby Mook were among the attendees. Also present were donors Alan Patricof, Bernard Schwartz, Marc Lasry, Jay Snyder, and Robert Zimmerman. Designers Vera Wang and Tory Burch were spotted, as well, along with Harvey Weinstein and restaurateur Danny Meyer, Fox News reported. The mood at the holiday party was no different than Clinton’s Election Night party, where attendees were spotted crying with grim expressions on their faces.
