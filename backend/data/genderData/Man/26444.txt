I know all too well the hallmarks of a Trump rally, including the ubiquitous protests: Opponents coming out to express their discomfort, usually disgust, at his policies, which they view as divisive, offensive and hateful. On the best days, protesters express themselves in a respectful way, appearing to appreciate that freedom of speech is viewed as one of the bedrocks of this country and should be celebrated. But Thursday evening, in San Jose, California, was the worst of nights. What began as a gathering of young people and labor rights’ groups outside of Trump’s rally here, turned into a raucous, bloody, dangerous affair. The crowd of hundreds became disorderly as a large group broke off with seemingly pernicious intentions to seek out anyone they suspected of being a Trump supporter and intimidate, harass or even beat them into submission. I watched an elderly couple get their “Make America Great Again” hats snatched off their heads, their signs ripped from their hands, their bodies shoved and their movements trailed by the angry agitators all the way into a parking garage. It did not end there. One young man stalked a Trump supporter shouting obscenities, threatening him. The dimly lit garage provided the perfect setting for the next wave of terror agitators surrounded a car where presumed Trump supporters sat parked, trying to make their way out. Suddenly, we heard the sound of breaking glass their   had been smashed right in front of me. It became a rallying cry, and the rest moved in toward the car and began to shake it violently. The terrified passengers finally were able to speed off. [  …    ] Earlier in the day in San Jose, the crowd of   protesters shouted to “Stop the Hate!” The irony. 3:15: Clinton tells MSNBC’s Andrea Mitchell that Trump’s attacks on Judge Curiel are “dangerous. ” HRC to @mitchellreports just now on Trump’s federal judge comments: ”I think it’s terrible.
