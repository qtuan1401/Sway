GOP frontrunner Donald Trump’s campaign projects the billionaire will reach 1, 400 delegates before the Republican National Convention in July and will clinch the GOP nomination on the first vote, according to the Washington Post. [“The Cruz spin machine produces more lies than anything else,” read a Trump campaign internal memo, which was obtained by the Post. “Our projections call for us to accumulate over 1400 delegates and thus a first ballot nomination win in Cleveland. ”  Trump must received 1, 237 delegates in order to become the Republican Party’s nominee. The internal memo, which was sent to Trump surrogates for media talking points, also shows the real estate mogul transitioning to the general election because it included notes about Democrat frontrunner Hillary Clinton. “Hillary email scandal is going to loom large over the next several months. If anyone else had done what she had done, they would already be in prison,” it read. More details within the memo can be read here.
