Democratic presidential candidate Hillary Clinton is racking up corporate donations. [A report by The Wall Street Journal found that out of the $36 million corporate employees donated to presidential campaigns, $31 million of those dollars went to Clinton.  In other words, 86 percent of corporate donors backed Clinton.  The Center for Responsive Politics provided the data and covers only donations over $200.  The donations were recorded over a   period from May to July 2016. At the same point in the election in 2012, Mitt Romney received 62 percent of the money from that same group of corporate donors, The Hill reported. “It’s no shock that Americans ranging from union members to CEOs agree that somebody as temperamentally unstable and unfit for the presidency as Donald Trump should not have his hands on our economy,” Josh Schwerin, a spokesperson for the Clinton campaign said. Steven Mnuchin, Trump’s national finance chairman, did not seem disturbed by the trend. Mnuchin said Clinton’s had an advantage among corporate donors because her “major focus has been doing   fundraisers and cozying up to big business. ” “We have not cozied up to big donors the way she has,” Mnuchin said to WSJ. In fact, Trump’s campaign has had more appeal among small donors, with 64 percent of his July total coming from donations of $200 or less, the report said.
