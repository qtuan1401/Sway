Washington (CNN) Next week is shaping up to inflict the most dramatic damage on television yet to Donald Trump’s campaign, with forces behind Hillary Clinton planning to outspend him by $13 million, a wider gap than any week so far. Clinton’s campaign has reserved about $7. 5 million in advertising time the week of July 4, according to advertising records reviewed Tuesday by   Media, a company that tracks political advertising. Clinton’s super PAC, Priorities USA, plans to spend $5. 5 million, with both groups devoting most of their cash to Florida and Ohio. The billionaire’s campaign has yet to air a single   advertisement, and has none booked for next week, according to   Media, nor do any of his super PACs. Trump has not bought TV advertising since early May spots in Indiana and Nebraska. Trump’s campaign did not immediately respond to a request for comment. Trump, who reversed his pledge to   his campaign after securing the Republican presidential nomination, is trying to assemble a fundraising operation at an unprecedented speed. The candidate and his joint fundraising committee with the Republican National Committee raised at least $11 million as of last week. As of the end of last month, his campaign had only $1. 3 million in its coffers, compared to $42 million for Clinton, according to Federal Election Commission filings.  Traditional Republican interest groups are not giving Trump any cover, either. The Freedom Partners Action Fund, a super PAC financed by the political network of Charles and David Koch, began a $3. 9 million advertising round this week    but for Senate candidates in Ohio and Nevada, not for the presumptive Republican presidential nominee. The Senate Leadership Fund, a super PAC tied to Republican strategist Karl Rove, announced Tuesday that it would reserve about $40 million in advertising for Senate candidates this fall. Rove’s allied groups that typically back the Republican presidential nominee have not yet engaged on Trump’s behalf.
