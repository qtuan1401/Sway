On this weekend’s broadcast of  “Fox News Sunday,” host Chis Wallace shocked Democratic presidential nominee Hillary Clinton campaign manager Robby Mook when after Mook repeatedly tried to dismiss the revelations in the thousands of emails released by WikiLeaks from a hack of Hillary Clinton’s campaign chairman John Podesta because they were stolen, Wallace pointed out no one seemed to discount Republican presidential nominee Donald Trump’s taxes that were also stolen and leaked to The New York Times.  Partial transcript as follows: MOOK: These are stolen documents, stolen by the Russians. It’s now confirmed from John Podesta, being put out for exactly this purpose. (CROSSTALK) WALLACE: Can I speak to that? Well, let me just speak to that, though, because, you know, the Trump tax returns were stolen as well when they were mailed to The New York Times. You guys didn’t object to that. In fact, you jumped all over them. MOOK: Well, we don’t know where those tax returns came from. WALLACE: Well, they weren’t  —   they were clearly stolen. MOOK: We don’t know and you have to  —   (CROSSTALK) WALLACE: Do you think Trump had given them? MOOK: I don’t know. I don’t know how they got to “The New York Times. ” WALLACE: I guess what I’m saying, if that  —   if we’re looking at the fruits of that theft, and I will call it a theft, it’s fair to look at the fruits of your theft. MOOK: Well, I think what’s particularly disturbing in this situation is that the intelligence community has now confirmed that John Podesta’s   and the DNC   were stolen by the Russians.
