GOP frontrunner Donald Trump released a statement on Tuesday responding to rival Sen. Ted Cruz’s ( ) attack earlier at a press conference calling Trump a “pathological liar. ”[Ted Cruz is a desperate candidate trying to save his failing campaign. It is no surprise he has resorted to his usual tactics of    rhetoric that nobody believes. Over the last week, I have watched Lyin’ Ted become more and more unhinged as he is unable to react under the pressure and stress of losing, in all cases by landslides, the last six primary elections  —   in fact, coming in last place in all but one of them. Today’s ridiculous outburst only proves what I have been saying for a long time, that Ted Cruz does not have the temperament to be President of the United States. “This man is a pathological liar. He doesn’t know the difference between truth and lies,” Cruz stated earlier in the day, prompting Trump’s response. “He lies  —   practically every word that comes out of his mouth. ”  Cruz called Trump a “narcissist” and also a “serial philanderer. ” He added that “morality doesn’t exist” for Trump. Cruz also blasted Trump for reportedly suggesting that Rafael Cruz, Cruz’s father, was connected to Lee Harvey Oswald, who killed President John F. Kennedy. “This is nuts,” Cruz responded. “The Texas senator mocked Trump’s suggestions, going on a sarcastic riff to lump in Trump with famous conspiracy theorists,” reports Business Insider. “Yes, my dad killed JFK. He’s secretly Elvis. And Jimmy Hoffa is buried in his backyard,” Cruz mocked.
