  Key reprised his role as President Obama’s “anger translator,” Luther, for one final goodbye on Comedy Central’s The Daily Show Thursday night as the real Obama prepares to leave office in two weeks. [As his former Key and Peele castmate Jordan Peele played a sober, reflective Obama delivering a final farewell address, Key’s Luther took the opportunity  —   as he has many times over the past few years  —   to express what Obama was really thinking, lashing out at Republicans for obstructing progress over the course of his presidency and freaking out about his successor, Republican Donald Trump.

To which Luther added: “Unless he succeeds with all the sh*t he promised to succeed with, in that case, we’re f*cked. ” As “Obama” finished his speech, a   Luther signed off for the last time: “Apparently, orange is the new black. Good luck with your healthcare, assholes. I’m out. ” Watch the skit above.   Follow Daniel Nussbaum on Twitter: @dznussbaum
