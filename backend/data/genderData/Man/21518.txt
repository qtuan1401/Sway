Former Secretary of State Condoleezza Rice is not interested in serving as presumptive Republican nominee Donald Trump’s vice president. [“Dr. Rice has repeatedly said in past cycles as well as this one, she’s not interested in being Vice President,” Georgia Godfrey, Rice’s chief of staff, said to Yahoo! News. “She’s happy at Stanford and plans to stay. ”  After President George W. Bush left the White House in 2009, Rice went to work as a professor at Stanford. Rice also is not planning on going to the Republican National Convention in July in Cleveland, Ohio, where Trump is expected to formally receive the Republican Party nomination. She has not been involved in the ups and downs of the 2016 presidential election, but she is planning to help   Republican candidates who are running for election, according to a source who spoke to Yahoo! News. “She plans on doing a few events to help her friends in the Senate,” the source reportedly said. “She’s concerned about    races and wants to be helpful where she can. ”
