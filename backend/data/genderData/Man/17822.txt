Donald Trump will campaign in New Mexico on Sunday, with his campaign now believing that the state, which has five electoral votes, is back in play in the wake of revelations that Hillary Clinton will be   by the FBI for her use of a private email server. [The decision comes after multiple polls suggesting that the race is now within the margin of error, with Donald Trump’s Senior Communication Advisor Jason Miller telling a New York radio station on Friday that Clinton and Trump were in a “statistical dead heat. ”  Trump’s running mate Mike Pence travelled to New Mexico last week in an attempt to rally his supporters, where he slammed failing Obamacare and outlined his plans to “pull it off the market. ” The last time New Mexico voted for a Republican president was in 2004 for George. W. Bush, with the state opting for Obama in both 2008 and 2012. In 2012, the state voted for Obama by a   margin against Mitt Romney. Another traditionally blue state now being targeted by the Trump campaign is Michigan, which hasn’t voted Republican since 1998. When asked whether Trump can win back states such as New Mexico and Michigan that have now become known as solidly Democrat, Miller said that “they are definitely in play. ” You can follow Ben Kew on Facebook, on Twitter at @ben_kew, or email him at bkew@breitbart. com
