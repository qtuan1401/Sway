On Friday’s broadcast of the Fox News Channel’s “Special Report,” columnist Charles Krauthammer stated that neither the audio of GOP presidential nominee Donald Trump’s lewd remarks, or emails from the campaign Democratic presidential nominee former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton’s are surprising, since “If somebody had asked you, about Trump, do you think he talks like this in private? You would answer of course yes. ” And “Everybody knows that on every issue she has a private position and a public. ”  Krauthammer said that with Clinton, “there is some devastating ammunition there, particularly open borders and open trade. ” He added, “None of this is surprising. If somebody had asked you, about Trump, do you think he talks like this in private? You would answer of course yes. But it’s hearing it. This is what   evidence does. Once you hear it, it becomes information of a different order. The same with Hillary. Everybody knows that on every issue she has a private position and a public. If they intersect, that’s nice, but if it doesn’t, that’s the way she operates. but when you hear her say it, admit it, say it in a speech in public, it becomes evidence. ” Krauthammer later added that the Clinton leak was done by someone who was waiting for Clinton to be the nominee, and whose “sentiments, at the least, are somewhat   or Republican. ” Follow Ian Hanchett on Twitter @IanHanchett
