Ann Coulter, author of “Adios, America” said that presumptive GOP nominee Donald Trump “is the heart and soul of the party” and “there’s no point in meeting” with Speaker Paul Ryan ( ) and “these generals without armies” on Tuesday’s edition of MSNBC’s “Hardball with Chris Matthews. ”  Coulter said, “Trump is being unbelievably gracious. He doesn’t need to have this meeting. He is the party. He is the heart and soul of the party. And I think he could have just said, ‘Hope he comes aboard. We’re going to have a lot of fun. But if he doesn’t, oh well.’   …     But the people are with him and there’s no point in meeting with these generals without armies. ” (  Mediaite) Follow Breitbart. tv on Twitter @BreitbartVideo
