’  ’ ’     Donald Trump on Friday relished in the defeat of   his political opponents. ’ ’   Speaking in Louisiana at a rally for US Senate candidate John   Kennedy, Trump took aim at the   Never Trump movement,   characterizing its members as on ”a respirator right now.” ’ ’   ”They are gasping,” he told the crowd. ”They are gasping for   air.” ’ ’   Boasting about defeating the Never Trump movement has been a   favorite for the   at his events. He did so at the   Republican National Convention over the summer, and he has   repeatedly noted that his detractors were wrong to predict he   could never win the election. ’ ’   At the Friday afternoon rally, Trump also said he is a ”big   believer in free speech” but wanted to outlaw the burning of the   American flag, an act the US Supreme Court has ruled is protected   by the Constitution. ’ ’’ ’   ”We are going to be putting something in” to prevent flag   burning, Trump said. ’ ’   The   also attacked the media, saying that he had   played a role in reducing the trust Americans have in the press. ’ ’   ”The one thing we have done is we have exposed the credibility of   the press,” he said, adding that journalists have ”the lowest   credibility.” ’ ’   Trump was scheduled to be in Michigan on Friday evening for   another leg of his ”thank you” tour. ’
