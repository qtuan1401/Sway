Sen. Marco Rubio wants to keep his delegates  —   even though he is no longer running for president. [That’s the message he is sending to Republican officials in several states where the Florida Senator won delegates, according to the Associated Press. Rubio currently has 171 delegates, according to Real Clear Politics, and will try to retain them as the Republican convention approaches.  The Washington Examiner’s Joel Gehrke obtained the text of a letter that Rubio sent to the Alaska Republican party, suggesting that he would like a say in how they vote during the Republican convention in July. “The decision to suspend my campaign for president of the Untied States is not intended to release any national convention delegates bound to me as a result of the 2016 delegate selection process that took place in your state,” Rubio wrote. “It is my desire at this time that the delegates allocated to me by your rules remain bound to vote for me on at least the first nominating ballot at the national convention. ” In Alaska, it appears that Rubio’s letter has had the desired effect. Officials had already reassigned Rubio’s five delegates to Trump and Ted Cruz, the Associated Press reported, but the delegates will now go back to Rubio. A copy of the letter was shared on Twitter by ABC News reporter Ines de La Cuetara: https:  .
