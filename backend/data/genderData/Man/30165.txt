Sunday on CNN’s “State of the Union,” senior adviser for    Donald Trump’s transition team Kellyanne Conway said while she will respect any decision   Donald Trump makes on who he appoints to secretary of state in his administration.  She also did not deny she has “concerns” over the possibility of former Gov. Mitt Romney ( ) filling that post. Partial transcript as follows: BASH: We know that you have been supportive of   Trump and his decisions but it really sounds  like personally not just that you have been receiving criticism and concerns about Mitt Romney, but you personally have concerns about a potential secretary of state Mitt Romney for Donald Trump. CONWAY: Well, it’s  —   I’m not sure my personal concerns matter. BASH: Am I wrong to say  —   CONWAY: That decision rests with one man. No, you’re not wrong to say that. Governor Romney went out of his way. It’s Donald Trump to show he has political instincts. Governor Romney ran for the same office four years ago and lost spectacularly.
