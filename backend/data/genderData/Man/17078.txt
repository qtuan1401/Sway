On the Friday edition of Breitbart News Daily, broadcast live on SiriusXM Patriot Channel 125 from 6AM to 9AM EST, host and Breitbart News Executive Chairman Stephen K. Bannon will be joined live   by Peter Schweizer, author of the bestselling book Clinton Cash and narrator of the new documentary of the same name. [Bannon, Schweizer and Breitbart Editor in Chief Alex Marlow will analyze the state of the presidential race as Hillary Clinton attempts to run from the truth about how she and her husband went from leaving the White House, in her own words, “dead broke” to now having an estimated net worth of $150 million. As Clinton Cash shows, this corrupt and avaricious power couple turned the U. S. State Department into their own private hedge fund by enriching themselves off of the misery and abject poverty of the poorest people in the most benighted countries in the world.  We also hear from the Washington Examiner’s David Drucker about Democrats hoping to learn from Trump’s messaging. Live from London, Rome, and Jerusalem, Breitbart correspondents will provide updates on the latest international news. Breitbart News Daily is the first live conservative radio enterprise to air seven days a week.
