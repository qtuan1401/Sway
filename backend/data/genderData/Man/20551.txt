Sunday on CBS’s “Face the Nation,”   columnist for The Washington Post Michael Gerson said some Republicans are at stage of panic over presumptive Republican presidential nominee Donald Trump.   Gerson said, “Well, I think that Republican leaders, like Mitch McConnell and Paul Ryan have proven that it doesn’t matter what Trump says, they’re willing to swallow it. He has already accused his opponent of possible complicity in murder, and now he’s accused the president of treason. There’s nothing they won’t take. But the thing that’s changing in the polling is support among Republicans. ” “And that, I think, all of a sudden, if it look like the House of Representatives is at risk, if it looks like a debacle, a disaster, you’re going to find Republicans all across the country rediscovering their conscience when it comes to Donald Trump. And we’re on that verge. We  —   you know, Republicans are at a stage of panic in the Republican National Committee many. The question is whether they’re going to move to a state of revolt. And that’s what I think what we’re going to see in the next two weeks. ” Follow Pam Key on Twitter @pamkeyNEN
