Behind Clinton, running mate Tim Kaine clapped while the audience laughed in response. Hillary Clinton coughs and a nation listens, Kellyanne Conway, Trump’s campaign manager, seized on the episode to tweak Clinton over her distance from the media    including not holding a   press conference since last December. ”Must be allergic to media. Finally spent a minute   them,” Conway wrote on Twitter. Hillary Clinton flies with the traveling press corps for the first time, Earlier Monday, Clinton took steps to seemingly answer more press questions, by including her traveling press corps on the same plane on which she flies. ”I will come back and talk to you more formally but I wanted to welcome you onto the plane,” Clinton said at the outset of a Labor Day campaign swing. Clinton has dealt with coughing fits before, but Monday’s among the most disruptive. She previously coughed excessively during a February 17 speech about race, in Harlem, New York, and in an earlier Iowa address, on January 25, at the Jewish Federation of Greater Des Moines.
