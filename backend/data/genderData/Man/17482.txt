On Sunday, CNN interviewed Thomas DiMassimo, the man who was arrested and charged with disorderly conduct and inducing panic after he allegedly tried to rush the stage Saturday at a Donald Trump rally in Ohio.  DiMassimo, 22, explained his reasoning, saying he wanted to take the podium away from the GOP presidential   to send a message. “I was thinking that I could get up on stage and take his podium away from him and take his mic away from him and send a message to all people out in the country who wouldn’t consider themselves racist, who wouldn’t consider themselves approving of what type of violence Donald Trump is allowing in his rallies, and send them a message that we can be strong, that we can find our strength and we can stand up against Donald Trump and against this new wave he’s ushering in of truly just violent white supremacist ideas,” DiMassimo stated. The Wright State University senior went on to say that he “can see right through” Trump’s “bold claims. ” He continued, “I was thinking that Donald Trump is a bully, and he is nothing more than that. He is somebody who is just saying a lot of bold things, he’s making bold claims. But I can see right through that and I can see that he’s truly just a coward. And he’s opportunistic and he’s willing to destroy this country for power for himself. ” Follow Trent Baker on Twitter @MagnifiTrent
