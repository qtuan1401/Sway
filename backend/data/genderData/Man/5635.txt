COLORADO SPRINGS  —   The Colorado Springs Fire Department said that Donald J. Trump, the Republican presidential nominee, had to be rescued from an elevator that was stuck between the first and second floors of a resort. In a statement released on Saturday, the department said that it was called at 1:30 p. m. on Friday to rescue about 10 people, including Mr. Trump, who were trapped inside the elevator at The Mining Exchange, a Wyndham Grand Hotel and Spa resort. The department said the firefighters opened the top elevator hatch and lowered a ladder into the elevator. Mr. Trump and the others used the ladder to climb out of the elevator to the second floor. The department said no injuries were reported. The Trump campaign confirmed that the incident occurred but did not provide details. During a rally on Friday at University of Colorado at Colorado Springs, Mr. Trump criticized the city’s fire marshal for limiting the number of people allowed to attend his speech at the building where the event was held. Fire Marshal Brett Lacey told the Colorado Springs Gazette that he had already agreed to allow a 10 percent increase in seating at the venue.
