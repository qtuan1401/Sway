(Want to get this briefing by email? Here’s the  .) Good evening. Here’s the latest. 1. The challenges facing Donald Trump have grown. Filings revealed that the Trump campaign, with just $1. 3 million in cash, is trailing Hillary Clinton by more than $41 million  —   even as it has made sizable payouts to his family and companies. Mr. Trump said the shortfall showed that his operation was “leaner and more efficient, like our government should be. ” But it also means that he’s leaning on the Republican National Committee for help. Above, protesters gathered outside the Manhattan hotel where Mr. Trump spoke to hundreds of evangelicals. _____ 2. Mrs. Clinton laced into Mr. Trump’s business record and economic policies. In a speech in Ohio, she called him the “king of debt,” said he would “rig the economy for Wall Street again” and warned that his idea of defaulting on American debt could start “a global panic. ” He responded on Twitter, including one tweet that said, “Her judgement has killed thousands, unleashed ISIS and wrecked the economy. ” _____ 3. A compromise on gun sales was proposed a day after four other measures stalled in the Senate. The new bill, restricting sales to terror suspects on the government’s “ ” list, was offered by Susan Collins, a Maine Republican, and Heidi Heitkamp, a North Dakota Democrat. Attorney General Loretta Lynch visited people wounded in the attack nine days ago in Orlando, Fla. while a state senator running for Congress said he would hold a drawing for a   rifle to burnish his   credentials. _____ 4. So much for an upset. The U. S. men’s soccer team lost   to Argentina in the semifinals of the Copa América Centenario. La Albiceleste, as the team is known, was ranked No. 1 by FIFA going into the tournament and features Lionel Messi, perhaps the best player in the world. Argentina will now play the winner of Wednesday’s semifinal match in Chicago between Colombia and Chile. _____ 5. There are those who see grand theater and operatic drama in sports. But the triumph of LeBron James and the Cleveland Cavaliers brings another kind of work of art to mind, which you may have heard of in high school. The story of a hero leaving the nest to find his fortune, making gains but suffering, and finally returning home to find it holds everything he ever needed? That’s the classic bildungsroman, our ( ) sports reporter reminds us. _____ 6. “Brits don’t quit. ” That was David Cameron, Britain’s prime minister, making a   appeal to voters to choose to remain in the European Union on Thursday. Three years ago, when he promised the referendum, it seemed like a safe way to buy a   peace with the   wing of his Conservative Party. But now polls suggest the outcome is too close to call. _____ 7. The F. A. A. issued new rules allowing a broad range of businesses to use drones under 55 pounds, but stopped short of allowing package delivery. A lawyer working on behalf of Amazon and Google said that once drones become commonplace, it will be “harder to argue against broader uses  —   like for delivery. ” _____ 8. If “The Graduate” were written today, the messianic businessman’s “one word” to Dustin Hoffman’s aimless character might be “biometrics” instead of “plastics. ” Some of the biggest U. S. banks are already enabling customers to use face and eye scans, fingerprints or voice analysis to access their accounts. “We believe the password is dying,” an expert on financial crime said. _____ 9. Finally, good news for a peculiar Central Asian antelope. The saiga population is beginning to recover after a mysterious ailment last year killed more than 200, 000  —   more than half  —   of the animals in Kazakhstan. In the   herd, numbers rose from 31, 000 to 36, 000 by April. “It’s fantastic news,” a preservationist said. _____ Your Evening Briefing is posted at 6 p. m. Eastern.
