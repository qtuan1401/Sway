’  ’ ”     Donald Trump has a large, vocal group of fans   from whom he can’t seem to escape. ” ’   Trump has, on multiple occasions, attempted to distance himself   from the   —           and     organizations among them  —   that have extolled his electoral   success as a boon to their movements. ’ ’   But Trump, by many accounts, has not disavowed     groups as strongly as he has other entities and individuals  —     like the  or  for example. ’ ’   Trump’’s most recent denouncement came in a New York Times    Tuesday, in which he said of     groups: ”I condemn them. I disavow and I condemn.” He : ”I don’’t want to energize the group, and I disavow the   group.” ’ ’   He had the same words for former Ku Klux Klan leader David Duke   in February, but . ’ ’   The incoming president and his advisers seem flabbergasted by   concerns that his simple condemnations  —   which tend to come after   extensive goading  —   are not enough. ’ ’   In an interview with CNN on Tuesday, Trump adviser Sean Spicer   was incredulous at the suggestion that Trump does not take any   initiative in disavowing the groups. ’ ’   ”When is it going to be enough?” Spicer asked CNN anchor Wolf   Blitzer, who repeatedly grilled him about Trump’’s stance on the   groups, asking if the   should perhaps deliver a   speech further denouncing the groups. ’ ’  ’ ’   ”He has condemned everyone that’’s come out, every group that   supported him. At some point, you’’ve got to take his position and   move on,” Spicer said. ”I don’’t know how many more times Donald   Trump can make his position clear.” ’ ’   Blitzer asked Spicer why   groups hang on to   Trump anyway. ’ ’   ”I don’’t know,” Spicer shot back. ”That’’s really not my focus,   figuring out why certain groups support him. . .. He won the   election with tens of millions of people. His focus is on making   the country better. . .. To ask him over and over again to   denounce the same people over and over again is getting a bit   preposterous.” ’ ’   ”You’’ve asked me the same question eight times. I’’ve told you   what his position is,” Spicer said. ’ ’   Trump campaigned and won the election in part by appealing to   fears over immigration, leaning heavily on overtones that seemed   to suggest middle America was under attack.     groups like the National Policy Institute, which held a     conference last weekend,  from Trump. ’ ’   Trump is now headed to the White House. ’ ’   Still, he has deigned to forcefully rebuke his     fans without being prompted. Their support,  right after   the election, is part of the reason why he won. ’
