Democratic nominee Hillary Clinton released a statement to Americans in response to Hurricane Matthew, urging them to listen to local officials and take shelter. [“This is a serious storm, and it has already caused serious damage,” she said in a statement released at about 11:00 a. m. on Friday. “If you get an evacuation order, please follow it immediately. ”  One of the Clinton campaign’s first reactions to the upcoming storm was to slot campaign ads for The Weather Channel and play politics with the voter registration date. Clinton said that her “thoughts and prayers” were with the victims of the storm and that her “heart is broken” for the victims. Donald Trump released a statement Thursday afternoon at around 3:00 p. m. “Please stay safe,” Trump wrote, offering thoughts and prayers for everyone in the path of the storm. “Nothing is more important than the safety of your family. ” Trump also thanked first responders for their efforts and extended condolences to the families in Haiti who lost lives.
