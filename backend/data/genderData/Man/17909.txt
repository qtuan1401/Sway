On this weekend’s broadcast of “Fox News Sunday,” veteran journalist Bob Woodward said of the Republican presidential nominee Donald Trump,”I have really no idea what he might do if he ever became president. ”  Woodward said, “No, I mean serious unanswered questions. But if  —   if I can step back just for a moment, I mean what’s going on here? What’s this all about with her and with Trump? In  —   in  —   in the case of Trump, I have really no idea what he might do if he ever became president. If you look at the statements, the proposals, the ideas, it’s a kind of a garage sale and I don’t know that there’s a Rembrandt behind that lawn mower that won’t start. But I haven’t seen it. And he has not communicated that. She has somewhat communicated what she would do. ” Follow Pam Key on Twitter @pamkeyNEN
