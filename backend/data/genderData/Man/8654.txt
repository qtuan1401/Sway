On Friday’s coverage of the Inauguration on NBC, host Chuck Todd said President Donald Trump has “missed some opportunities these last six to eight weeks to  —   and again, I’ll go to what  —   to just erase the asterisk. ”  Todd said Trump “needs to earn this honeymoon. I think he has an opportunity to earn it. But he’s, I’m sorry, I’ve said it before, he missed some opportunities these last six to eight weeks to  —   and again, I’ll go to what  —   to just erase the asterisk. Whatever you want to say about it, and I know some of his supporters will say, ‘Why do you say that?’ But, look, when you win an election this way, the split popular vote, you know it’s a divided country. ” (  NewsBusters) Follow Ian Hanchett on Twitter @IanHanchett
