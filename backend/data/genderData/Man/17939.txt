Wednesday on Fox New Channels’ The Kelly File, anchor Megyn Kelly confirmed the reports of her meeting with Republican presidential candidate Donald Trump earlier in the day at Trump Towers.  Kelly said she was the one who requested the meeting and it allowed the pair to “clear the air. ” Kelly said, “Now to that other story. You may have heard that yours truly took a trip over to Trump Towers over on Fifth Avenue in New York City. The meeting was at my request, and Mr. Trump was gracious enough to agree to it. We met for about an hour, just the two of us, and had a chance to clear the air. Mr. Trump and I discussed the possibility of an interview, and I hope we will have news to announce on that soon. By the way in case you were wondering, yes the doormen appeared a bit stunned when I walked in, and they too were incredibly gracious. ”  Follow Pam Key on Twitter @pamkeyNEN
