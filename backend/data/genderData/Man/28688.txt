During a campaign rally in Cedar Rapids, Iowa on Friday night, Donald Trump criticized his opponent Hillary Clinton for attempting to politicize the recent news that the FBI reopened its investigation into her email scandal, which was revealed earlier on Friday. [Trump called the reopening of the investigation the “biggest political scandal since Watergate. ”  “It’s everybody’s hope that justice at last can be delivered,” the Republican nominee told supporters at the McGrath Amphitheater late Friday night. “Tonight, Hillary Clinton tried to politicize this investigation,” he stated, referencing Clinton’s brief press conference Friday evening where she reacted to the news that the FBI reopened its investigation, stating that FBI Director James Comey only notified Republican leaders in Congress of the reopened investigation, Trump said that was “another Clinton lie,” alleging that the FBI director sent the notification letter of the reopened investigation to both Republican and Democratic leaders in Congress. “I’ve had plenty of words about the FBI lately, but I give them great credit for having the courage to right this horrible wrong. Justice will prevail,” Trump declared.
