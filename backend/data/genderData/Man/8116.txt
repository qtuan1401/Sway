President Donald Trump visited St. Andrew Catholic School in Pine Hills, Florida, on Friday to draw attention to his plan to open up education opportunities to every child with school choice. [During the visit, Trump quoted Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr. who hoped that “inferior education would become a thing of the past. ” He commented that the school was doing a “fantastic job” and pointed out that education at St. Andrew “enriches both the mind and the soul. ”  “That’s a good education,” he added. Trump spoke to a class of about 25 students, asking them what they wanted to do with their lives and where they wanted to go to college. One student said she hoped to open her own business. “That’s a good idea. Make a lot of money, right? But don’t run for politics after,” Trump replied. Trump was joined by Florida Governor Rick Scott and Senator Marco Rubio, as well as Secretary of Education Betsy Devos. Ivanka Trump and Jared Kushner also joined the trip.
