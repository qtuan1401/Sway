Republican National Committee Chairman Reince Priebus suggests it will take time for some in the Republican Party to warm up to presumed nominee Donald Trump, and says his first goal is to broker peace between Trump and Speaker of the House Paul Ryan. [“My view is just relax and be gracious and I’ll talk to Paul and we’ll try to work on this,” Priebus told Politico about what he said to Trump.  Ryan said on Thursday he’s not yet ready to support Trump. The billionaire then responded, saying he’s not yet ready to support Ryan’s agenda. So many great endorsements yesterday, except for Paul Ryan! We must put America first and MAKE AMERICA GREAT AGAIN!  —   Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) May 6, 2016,  Priebus talked with both Trump and Ryan “multiple times” on Thursday. He told Politico that Trump called him after he saw Ryan on CNN say he wasn’t ready to support him. “Trump’s attitude during that call was along the lines of “what do I need to do” to get Ryan to support me, Priebus said,” reports Politico. “I said, listen let me just, my view is just relax and be gracious and I’ll talk to Paul and we’ll try to work on this,” Priebus explained. “And so I’m comfortable with the idea that it is going to take some time in some cases for people to work through differences,” he added. “We talked about it and talked about it multiple times and they’re very comfortable with sitting down with Donald Trump, and it may be at my office, it may be somewhere else but we’re going to have that meeting to start the process of unifying. ”
