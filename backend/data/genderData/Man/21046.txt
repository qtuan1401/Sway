Former federal prosecutor Paul Butler appeared on MSNBC’s “PoliticsNation” with Al Sharpton Sunday to weigh in on   Donald Trump choosing Sen. Jeff Sessions ( ) to serve as his attorney general.  Butler called Sessions a “radical extremist” who would bring “civil rights cases on behalf of white people. ” Partial transcript as follows: All of these progressive interventions for civil rights, they would be not only dead on arrival, [Sessions] would take us back. Because one thing we’ve seen with other conservative administrations is not only do they stop bringing the cases, they start bringing civil rights cases on behalf of white people. They start saying things like Affirmative Action, like set asides for minority and women owned businesses, they start making the argument those are unconstitutional. Guess what, if Trump gets his way with the Supreme Court, they’re gonna win those arguments. We’re talking about a radical extremist here who would be in charge of protecting everybody’s civil rights. He hasn’t shown any evidence that he’s capable of doing that.
