’   A German reporter asked President Donald Trump on Friday why he   was so ”scared of diversity in the news,” referencing the   president’’s repeated attempts to delegitimize     media organizations by calling them ”fake news.” ’ ’   ”Mr. President, ’’America First’’  —   don’’t you think this is going   to weaken the European Union?” the reporter first asked,   referring to Trump’’s campaign slogan. ’ ’   She then added: ”And why are you scared of diversity in the news   and in the media that you speak so often of ’’fake news’’?” ’ ’ ’ ”   Trump took issue with the first prong of the reporter’s question,   insisting he is in favor of free trade. ” ’   ”I’’m not an isolationist. I’’m a free trader,” he said. ”But I’’m   also a fair trader. And our free trade has led to a lot of bad   things happening.” ’ ’’ ’   The president concluded by suggesting the reporter herself had   been reading ”fake news.” ’ ’   ”I am not an isolationist by any stretch of the imagination,”   Trump said. ”So I don’’t know what newspaper you’’re reading, but I   guess that would be another example of, as you say, ’’fake news. ’’” ’ ’   The comments came during a brief joint press conference with   German Chancellor Angela Merkel. ’ ’A German reporter asked President Donald Trump. ..’ ’’ ’’ ’’
