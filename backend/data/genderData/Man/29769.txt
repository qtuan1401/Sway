Wednesday on the campaign trail in New York, Democratic presidential   Hillary Clinton went on the offensive against Republican presidential hopefuls Donald Trump and Sen. Ted Cruz ( ).  She said, “On the Republican side, what we are hearing is truly scary —  when Donald Trump talks casually about using torture and allowing more countries to get nuclear weapons, or when Ted Cruz calls for treating American Muslims like criminals and racial profiling predominantly Muslim neighborhoods. That doesn’t make them sound strong, that makes them sound in over their heads. ” Clinton added, “When a candidate for president says we can solve America’s problems by building a wall, discriminating against people based on their religion and turning against each other, well New Yorkers know better. ” Follow Pam Key on Twitter @pamkeyNEN
