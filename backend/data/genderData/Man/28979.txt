Alarmed by Donald Trump’s frank apology included in his speech from Charlotte, North Carolina Thursday, the Clinton campaign scrambled to cast doubt on its authenticity. [“Sometimes, in the heat of debate and speaking on a multitude of issues, you don’t choose the right words or you say the wrong thing. I have done that, and I regret it, particularly where it may have caused personal pain,” Trump said. “Too much is at stake for us to be consumed with these issues. But one thing I can promise you is this: I will always tell you the truth. ”  But the Clinton campaign ridiculed his statement as something cooked up by his new campaign advisors and placed on his teleprompter. “Donald Trump literally started his campaign by insulting people,” said Deputy Communications Director Christina Reynolds, reminding reporters that he had spent 428 days offending people “without shame or regret. ” Trump’s speech amazed members of the media, who have turned their full fury against him for his controversial statements and personal vendettas. But the Clinton campaign demanded more specifics from Trump  —   and more proof that he had changed. “We learned tonight that his speechwriter and teleprompter knows he has much for which he should apologize,” Reynolds wrote. “But that apology tonight is simply a   phrase until he tells us which of his many offensive, bullying and divisive comments he regrets  —   and changes his tune altogether. ”
