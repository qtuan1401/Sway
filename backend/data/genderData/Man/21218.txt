Ben Carson said he would help   Donald Trump construct a replacement to Obamacare. [“I think the replacement must obviously come first and it must be something that is very appealing and easy to understand,” he told Politico Wednesday. “And then, only then, would you dismantle what’s in place. ”  Carson declined to say whether he was being considered for a Cabinet position, but Politico reports that his name is being floated as a possible candidate for positions such as secretary of health and human services or secretary of education. Trump campaigned on replacing Obamacare with a simpler, cheaper alternative that has less government regulation. A   Congress means that a Trump administration would have the best chance of coming up with an alternative to Obamacare since 2010 passage of the law. Carson entered the spotlight at the 2013 National Prayer Breakfast when he criticized President Obama over his signature healthcare law. Carson ran against Trump in the primary only to drop out and endorse him in March. Carson said Wednesday that Trump would win over his critics with his leadership on issues like Obamacare. “I think actually a lot of people who have tried to demonize him will be quite shocked when they see who he really is,” he said.  “He’ll be a very easy person to work with as long as you’re reasonable, as long as you’re fair. ” In 2015, Ben Carson announced his support for health savings accounts as a possible replacement for Obamacare.
