Fox News Channel host Greg Gutfeld argued that GOP presidential candidate Donald Trump’s campaign made a “grotesque,” “Sopranos in khakis,” “threat” against FNC host Megyn Kelly and “if you don’t think this was a big deal, you do not belong in this profession. Go do infomercials selling Flowbees, because that’s where you belong” on Wednesday’s broadcast of “The Five. ”  Gutfeld said, “I don’t think it is about Donald Trump at all. I don’t even think it is about the debate.   …     This is about a threat made against someone in the media. [Trump campaign manager] Corey Lewandowski made a threat, basically saying that, ‘Hey, Megyn Kelly, you don’t want to see what happens to you again, what happened after that debate.’ I mean, that  —   this is no longer a campaign. It’s a Sopranos in khakis. I mean, this is nuts. It’s like saying, ‘Hey, Megyn, you got a nice gig going. It would be a real shame if were to happen to you.’ And this is grotesque to me. And it’s not about Fox News. It is about ABC, NBC, CBS, CNN. What if their anchor was faced with a threat because they didn’t kiss the ring of a petulant king? This is a big problem, because once you start bowing because you don’t please them because you’re scared, then you lose. You’re no longer a journalist. And if you don’t think this is a big deal that she was threatened, if you don’t think this was a big deal, you do not belong in this profession. Go do infomercials selling Flowbees, because that’s where you belong. ” He later added that Trump is scared of Kelly, but that it is a “good point” to say, as guest host Jesse Watters did, that while Trump “went over the line there. ” Fox doesn’t want or need the mainstream media to defend it.
