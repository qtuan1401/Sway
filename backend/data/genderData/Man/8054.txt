Statement from @PublicTheaterNY after a protester stormed the stage during tonight’s production of Julius Caesar: pic. twitter.   —   Kurt Chirbas (@kchirbas) June 17, 2017,  The Public Theater’s production of Julius Caesar has caused national controversy over the bloody scene in which a   character  —   complete with blond hair and a business suit and red tie  —   is stabbed to death. The resulting backlash against the play has led companies, including Delta Air Lines and Bank of America, to pull funding from the theater. What’s more, New York City’s Public Theater has reportedly received nearly $30 million in federal, state, and city grants since 2009, according to data published by OpenTheBooks CEO and Forbes contributor Andrew Andrzejewski. Friday’s was the first protest of the play, which ends production on Sunday. Follow Jerome Hudson on Twitter: @JeromeEHudson
