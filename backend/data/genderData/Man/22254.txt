Democratic pollster and analyst Pat Caddell, in speaking of a potential Hillary Clinton presidency, told Breitbart News Daily SiriusXM host Alex Marlow on Thursday, “We’re talking about institutionalizing corruption in a way that is like a   Banana Republic if she’s elected. ”[Caddell added, “And that is not being presented to the American people, who are quite concerned about corruption. ”  Caddell was pointing out the degree to which the media have mostly ignored the details behind the questionable financial practices involving the Clintons, instead focusing far more on negative coverage of Donald Trump. The two also discussed recent WikiLeaks revelations about Hillary Clinton’s indifference to corruption, as Breitbart News reported: “[Hillary Clinton] seems indifferent to the systemic corruption that makes it impossible for government to act for the middle class or address big problems, like climate or health care. She may be immune to    but the systemic isn’t. She’s got to distinguish between self and country  —   and needs to. ” Breitbart News Daily airs on SiriusXM Patriot 125 weekdays from 6:00 a. m. to 9:00 a. m. Eastern. LISTEN:
