Saturday on MSNBC, political analyst Elise Jordan reacted to presumptive GOP presidential nominee Donald Trump labeling Democratic presidential candidate Hillary Clinton an enabler for how she treated former President Bill Clinton’s victims.  Jordan said Trump should tone down labeling Hillary Clinton as an enabler, reasoning that “she was essentially a victim, too. ” “I think it’s a mistake because [Donald Trump]’s going to end up engendering sympathy for Hillary Clinton down the road. Just because of all the people in this, aside from the women, she was essentially a victim, too,” Jordan stated. Follow Trent Baker on Twitter @MagnifiTrent
