(Want to get this briefing by email? Here’s the  .) Good evening. Here’s the latest. 1. President Obama returned to Elkhart, Ind. the first city he visited after taking office, to celebrate it as a showcase for his economic policies’ success. He took his most forceful stance yet on the presidential election, accusing Republicans of aiming to help the rich at the expense of the struggling middle class. He did not mention Donald Trump by name, but railed against his pledge to roll back rules on Wall Street. _____ 2. Hillary Clinton also attacked Mr. Trump. She cited testimony from former employees portraying Trump University as unscrupulous and predatory and called him “a fraud. ” Above, a rally in New Jersey. On Thursday, she plans to use a speech in San Diego to lay out the damage a Trump presidency could do to national security. Meanwhile, the list of prominent Republicans who say they will not attend the Republican National Convention keeps growing. _____ 3. A French naval vessel picked up a signal believed to be from a data recorder belonging to EgyptAir Flight 804, the jet that crashed into the Mediterranean on May 19. Officials said it could take days to locate the source precisely, and then more time for underwater robots and sonar equipment to hunt for wreckage. _____ 4. Switzerland opened a   rail tunnel  —   the world’s longest and deepest  —   clearing the way for a   rail link under the Alps. The E. U.’s transportation minister called the Gotthard Base Tunnel “a milestone in European rail history. ” The new route should cut an hour off the   trip between the economic hubs of Zurich and Milan. _____ 5. It’s been nine years since the seventh and last “Harry Potter” book came out. One of our   stories today looks at how J. K. Rowling has kept her creative hand in   like outing Dumbledore as gay a few years ago. And her “official” eighth installment is nigh. “Harry Potter and the Cursed Child,” a play in which the boy wizard is all grown up, begins previews in London next week. _____ 6. A huge wildfire is still ripping through western Canada. But the flames are out in the city of Fort McMurray, a hub of the   industry. Thousands of residents are being allowed back, if only to document damage for insurance claims. Crews are spraying sealant over toxic ash and rubble, and the government is working on a rail plan to remove masses of refrigerators and freezers ruined by spoiled food. _____ 7. Uber, Silicon Valley’s most valuable private business, has collected billions from investors over the last three years as it seeks to build a global empire. Now, Saudi Arabia is in, too, with $3. 5 billion, Uber’s biggest single infusion. The Saudis are seeking to expand their economy beyond oil. _____ 8. A strange, gruesome murder in Plano, Tex. played out partly on social media. This man told the police that he’d made a suicide pact with his girlfriend but that she’d “chickened out,” so he stabbed her to death. He also posted photos of each of them after the fact. He has been charged with murder, and Facebook has been criticized for leaving the photos up for 36 hours. _____ 9. The Syrian government eased limits on aid convoys, allowing the first trucks with food and medicine to reach the besieged   town of Daraya, on the outskirts of Damascus. Aid groups said the government was simply trying to stop the U. N. from turning to airdrops. Some critics have accused the government of trying to starve its opponents. _____ 10. Finally, many Americans worried about high blood pressure try to limit their salt intake, but the table shaker isn’t the problem. Processed and prepared foods tend to send sodium levels off the charts. The F. D. A. released voluntary guidelines for food manufacturers and restaurants urging gradual reductions. Public health advocates say the standards could eventually help avert thousands of heart attacks and strokes. _____ Your Evening Briefing is posted at 6 p. m. Eastern.
