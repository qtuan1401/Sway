Donald Trump is ending his “blacklist” of certain media outlets that he began last year, according to CNN. [Starting Thursday, the Trump campaign will approve credentials for the Washington Post, Politico and Buzzfeed  —   which were all previously banned from covering Trump events as press. However, many reporters were able to attend Trump campaign events as members of the general public.  Trump commented on the restoration of credentials to CNN, saying, “I figure they can’t treat me any worse!” The Huffington Post, Des Moines Register and the Daily Beast were also outlets that had been blacklisted by Trump.
