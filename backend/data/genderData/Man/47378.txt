’  ’ ’     Sen. Bernie Sanders may not have a single bit of chance to     clinch the Democratic Party presidential candidacy.   ’ ”     But he hasn’t actually ended his campaign, which means the U. S.     Secret Service is still traveling with him wherever he goes and     a team of agents is guarding his home.   ” ’     The   protection is hardly cheap, costing taxpayers some     $38, 000 a day, .   ’ ”     If Sanders chooses to stay in his current limbo it means his     security detail could cost taxpayers more than $1. 56 million in     the weeks between the last primary and the Democratic     convention that begins on July 25. Sander aides did not dispute     the Post’s figure but did insist that the cost now is     lower than in the past when the senator held several rallies a     day in different cities.   ” ’     While many Democrats continue to call on Sanders to drop out,     the senator from Vermont received support from an unlikely       Trump. In a speech on Saturday, Trump said ”crazy     Bernie” may be ”crazy as a bed bug, but he doesn’’t quit.” The     presumptive Republican nominee suggested Sanders  over her use of a private email server.   ’ ’     ”I think Bernie should continue to go forward, folks, he should     continue to go forward. He should fight to the last end. Well,     he is waiting for really the FBI to do what everybody thinks     they’’re going to do,” . ”I think he is     sort of saying look, oh, let’’s hang in there. Because     ultimately, it’’s called the FBI convention. And then we’’ll be     the only people.”   ’ ’Sen. Bernie Sanders may not have a single bit. ..’
