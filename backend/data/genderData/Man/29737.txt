Sunday on NBC’s “Meet The Press,” while discussing possible Russian interference into the 2016 presidential election, former chairman of the 2016 Hillary Clinton presidential campaign John Podesta said “It’s very much unknown whether there was collusion,” between   Donald Trump’s campaign and the Russian government so “there needs to be an independent investigation into this. ”  Podesta said, “I would argue it’s very much unknown whether there was collusion. I think Russian diplomats have said post election that they were talking to the Trump campaign. Roger Stone in August foreshadowed the fact that they had hacked my   and those would be forthcoming when he said he was in touch with Julian Assange and Wikileaks. Carter Page, one of Trump’s foreign policy advisers went to Russia before the Republican convention and met with a person in the Russian hierarchy who was responsible for collecting intelligence. So I think it’s really not what Mr. Trump knew but what did Trump Inc. know and when did they know it? Were they in touch with the Russians? I think those are still open questions. The electors have a right to know what the answers are if the U. S. Government has those answers before the election. That’s also why I said there needs to be an independent investigation into this. ” Follow Pam Key on Twitter @pamkeyNEN
