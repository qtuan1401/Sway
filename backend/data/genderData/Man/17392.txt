“I have never seen a human being eat in such a disgusting fashion,” Donald Trump said in Rhode Island yesterday at a campaign event, referring to his campaign opponent John Kasich and his eating habits. [“This guy takes a pancake and he’s shoving it in his mouth. It is disgusting,” he continued. “Do you want that for your president? I don’t think so, I don’t think so. Honestly it’s disgusting. ”  Trump was referring to Kasich’s on camera interview Monday morning while he was eating pancakes in a Philadelphia diner. The presidential trail is peppered with visits to restaurants, diners, cafes, and bars, but Kasich has a reputation for diving into campaign food with gusto. Campaigning in the Bronx, Kasich ate two plates of spaghetti bolognese, a sandwich with mozzarella, pickles, salami, provolone, and hot peppers before ordering a dish pasta fagioli. Later that afternoon he ate pizza live on camera to prove that he didn’t always eat it with a fork.
