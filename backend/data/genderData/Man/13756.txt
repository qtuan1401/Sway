I’m so happy to be here to welcome you all to the inauguration of the 45th president of the United States, Donald J. Trump. ”  Voight continued, recounting that the election was “a barrage of propaganda that left us all breathless with anticipation not knowing if God could reverse all the negative lies against Mr. Trump, whose only desire was to make America great again. ” “He certainly didn’t need this job. And yes, God answered all our prayers,” the   said. Voight assured the crowd that Abraham Lincoln was smiling knowing “America will be saved by an honest and good man who will work for all the people, no matter their creed or color. ” The Deliverance star endorsed Trump for president last March in an exclusive interview with Breitbart News. “He’s an answer to our problems,” Voight said. “We need to get behind him.
