Thursday Politico released an audio recording from a private fundraiser last month, in which Sen. John McCain ( ) said that likely presumptive Republican presidential nominee Donald Trump will jeopardize his reelection bid because of Latino voters’ “anger” with Trump’s policy proposals.  McCain said, “If Donald Trump is at the top of the ticket, here in Arizona, with over 30 percent of the vote being the Hispanic vote, no doubt that this may be the race of my life. ” He added, “If you listen or watch Hispanic media in the state and in the country, you will see that it is all  .
