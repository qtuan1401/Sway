Thursday during her “The Kelly File” program on the Fox News Channel, host Megyn Kelly pointed out that MSNBC’s Joe Scarborough and others on his “Morning Joe” show had once been very complimentary of Republican presidential nominee Donald Trump and have since changed their tune.  Kelly remarks were in reference to Scarborough’s claim Trump had inquired about using nuclear weapons during a foreign policy briefing. “Even MSNBC and their morning program over there, I mean, they could not have promoted Trump more,” Kelly said. “And now today, Joe Scarborough is out there talking about how three times in one meeting, [Trump] asked why he couldn’t drop a nuclear weapon. Once Trump got mad at him, he stopped saying nice things about him. ” (  The Hill) Follow Breitbart. tv on Twitter @BreitbartVideo
