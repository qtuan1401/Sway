’  ’ ’   Republican presidential nominee Donald Trump on Sunday told   Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu that if elected, the   United States would recognize Jerusalem as the capital of Israel,   the campaign said, marking a potential dramatic shift in U. S.   policy on the issue. ’ ’  ’ ’   During the meeting that lasted more than an hour at Trump Tower   in New York, Trump told Netanyahu that under his administration,   the United States would ”recognize Jerusalem as the undivided   capital of the State of Israel.” ’ ’   While Israel calls Jerusalem its capital, few other countries   accept that, including the United States. Most nations maintain   embassies in Tel Aviv. ’ ’   Palestinians want East Jerusalem, captured by Israel in a 1967   war, as capital of the state they aim to establish alongside   Israel in the West Bank and Gaza Strip. ’ ’   During the   meeting, the campaign said that Trump   agreed with Netanyahu that peace in the Middle East could only be   achieved when ”the Palestinians renounce hatred and violence and   accept Israel as a Jewish State.” ’ ’   According to a readout of the meeting from the campaign, the two   discussed ”at length” Israel’’s border fence, cited by Trump in   reference to his own controversial immigration policies, which   include building a wall on the U. S.  Mexico border and   temporarily banning Muslims from entering the country. ’ ’   Other regional issues, including the fight against Islamic State,   U. S. military assistance to Israel  —   ”an excellent investment”  —     and the Iran nuclear deal, which both parties have criticized,   were also discussed. ’
