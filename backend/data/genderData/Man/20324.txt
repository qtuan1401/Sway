Sunday on Fox News Channel’s “MediaBuzz,”conservative commentator Charles Krauthammer said he underestimated the appeal of Republican presidential candidate Donald Trump because he found his success, “unfathomable. ”  Krauthammer said, “I found his appeal so unappealing that I found that unfathomable that he would garner such a large constituency. I still remain mildly amazed by the phenomenon. But I know longer deny it. ” He added, “I have absolutely no animus against him as a person. I have no reason to. Had he not become a presidential candidate, I mean, I don’t talk about him otherwise. I just think he out of his depths and while obviously he’s a good candidate  —   and maybe he will win  —   although I’d be surprised  —   I think he’d be very bad for the country. That’s the only criteria by which I judge him. ” Follow Pam Key on Twitter @pamkeyNEN
