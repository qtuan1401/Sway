[When we launched the Breitbart Primary Straw Poll with a packed slate of over a dozen candidates, Breitbart readers consistently chose Donald Trump as the nominee. They got it right. They got it right because they reflect the landscape of the American public at large.  Now we turn to our readers to see where they weigh in on who should be Trump’s running mate. We’ve assembled a list of the most likely candidates on Trump’s short (or even long) list of candidates. VOTE NOW in the Breitbart News Vice Presidential Straw Poll.
