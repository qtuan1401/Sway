They had not even contemplated the possibility that they might not prevail. And that, I think, is the direct result of not listening to and not hearing the American people.” Trump’s transition rollercoaster ride, At the National Lawyer Convention, an annual event hosted by the Federalist Society, Cruz also praised   Donald Trump’s pick of Alabama Sen.
