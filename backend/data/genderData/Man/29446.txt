Republican presidential nominee Donald Trump responded to President Barack Obama’s assertion that he was “unfit” to hold the office of the presidency, pointing out Hillary Clinton’s failures. [“They have betrayed our security and our workers, and Hillary Clinton has proven herself unfit to serve in any government office,” Trump said referring to the Obama presidency.  Trump cited the   foreign policy failures  —   including losing Iraq, Libya, and Syria to Islamic state terrorists. He also cited Clinton’s failure to protect Americans in Benghazi while Obama put Iran on a path to nuclear weapons. He also pointed out the miserable   record on immigration, failing to protect Americans from dangerous criminal illegal immigrants and losing American jobs overseas. “She is reckless with her emails, reckless with regime change, and reckless with American lives,” Trump said, referring to Clinton. “Our nation has been humiliated abroad and compromised by radical Islam brought onto our shores. We need change now. ”
