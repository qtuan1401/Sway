Sunday on Fox News Channel’s “Fox  Friends,” former Republican presidential candidate and presumptive nominee Donald Trump supporter, Dr. Ben Carson said the “Never Trump” movement had a “almost incomprehensible” level of arrogance.  Carson said, “Well, you know, there’s a level of arrogance there that is almost incomprehensible. We have a system in place that allows the will of the people to be expressed. Now these people come along and say the people don’t know what they are talking about. Get them out of here. We’re the ones who know who the nominee should be. I hope people are taking note of that and who these people are. ” Follow Pam Key on Twitter @pamkeyNEN
