Twitter users blasted Hillary Clinton Thursday  —   calling her a “liar” who “stole billions in donations meant to rebuild Haiti,” because she doesn’t “give a f*ck about Black people”  —   after her social media minions posted a tweet attacking Republican White House hopeful Donald Trump, calling him “temperamentally unfit to be president and   . ”[Before telling the real estate magnet to delete his Twitter account, Clinton posted a tweet describing “Donald Trump’s School of Philanthropy” as exploitative as it relates to his charitable donations.  Donald Trump’s School of Philanthropy:1. Pledge money to causes2. Do nothing3. Cut a check only if you get caughthttps:  .   —   Hillary Clinton (@HillaryClinton) June 9, 2016,  But Clinton’s latest line of attack against Trump infuriated myriad Twitter users, many of them   familiar with Bill and Hillary Clinton’s   history of using their global connections to exploit poor people, as well as the land and resources of impoverished countries: namely, Haiti. Indeed in the wake of the earthquake in Haiti in 2010  —   while 316, 000 lifeless bodies lay buried under rubble, and while 300, 000 Haitians suffered from injuries, with another 1. 3 million displaced  —   Hillary Clinton’s family and monied cronies cashed in on the back of the   Caribbean country. Hillary Clinton’s brother, Toni Rodham, landed a lucrative and historically rare Haitian “gold exploitation permit,” while Clinton Foundation donors, including Digicel mobile phone company founder Denis O’Brien, were winning   dollar contracts that would siphon massive profits from the “poorest country in the Western Hemisphere. ” And Twitter users wasted no time reminding Hillary Clinton of how she “screwed Haiti in the midst of a national catastrophe. ” @HillaryClinton You robbed HAITI OF ITS GOLD You don’t give a f**** about Black people or anyone but your own family https:  .   —   Jackson Ross (@secondsunrising) June 9, 2016,  @HillaryClinton and dumb dumb screwed Haiti a people in the midst of a national catastrophe but we’re willing to elect her #IDontThinkSo,  —   BernieOrBustArmy (@JabbertJ) June 9, 2016,  @billclinton @HillaryClinton stole $Billions from Haiti Earthquake Relief funds! pic. twitter.   —   Phil’s Chirps (@MiskaPhillip) June 8, 2016,  Hillary Clinton made history as the 1st nominee to have stollen billions in donations meant yo rebuild Haiti pic. twitter.   —   Melissa (@Sweetatertot) June 8, 2016,  Never TRUST HILLARY CLINTON LOOK AT HAITI made PROMISES lied TOOK OVER SAID FREE VISA ONLY WANT GOLDLAND👿utube it😢 https:  .   —   Debra Vega Vega (@DebraVegaVega1) June 8, 2016,  Gd @billclinton y dont u and @HillaryClinton come up   reciepts for all $ donated to #Haiti relief thru #ClintonGlobalFoundation #MAGA,  —   Blizzard Lizzard (@PopsClazy) June 9, 2016,  @HillaryClinton The people of Haiti want the money back you stole from them. https:  .  #NeverHillary,  —   diane v (@jnjsmom) June 9, 2016,  @HillaryClinton And don’t even get me started on Haiti!!
