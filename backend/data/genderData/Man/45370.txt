Even though it is a culture and it’’s a cultural thing, he goes in, he takes over, and he’’s the boss,” Trump recalled. ”It’’s incredible. He wiped out the uncle. He wiped out this one, that one. I mean, this guy doesn’’t play games. And we can’’t play games with him. Because he really does have missiles.
