Republican presidential candidate Sen. Ted Cruz ( ) said Tuesday that rival Donald Trump resorts to “crude and profane” insults because “He can’t defend his own record. ”[Cruz was responding to Trump, who repeated an audience members’ crude insult about Cruz at a rally on Monday.  “There is a reason Donald Trump engages in profane insults: Because he can’t defend his own record,” Cruz said on Tuesday in New Hampshire. “And usually, the insults are pretty crude and profane. He’s welcome to do that. ” Cruz blamed Trump’s outburst on him being a sore loser and his inability to defend “his support of government controlled healthcare, of socialized medicine. ” “Well, look, Donald doesn’t handle losing very well, and his typical response is to engage in insults,” Cruz said. “He doesn’t like the fact that he lost in Iowa. So he’s chosen to go down the road of insults. ” “I think the people of New Hampshire deserve better than someone just throwing mud and insulting other candidates,” Cruz said
