  Donald Trump is planning executive actions and proposed legislation on border security in the first 100 days, according to a transition team official. [Answering a question from Breitbart News on a conference call with reporters, Trump transition team spokesman Jason Miller reacted to the news that the Obama administration had scrapped the National Security   Registration System.  Miller indicated that there would “much more to come” in response to the decision, as Trump finished making appointments in the necessary areas of government dealing with border security and immigration. “The national policy team and the incoming cabinet and administration members are spending a lot of time reviewing potential executive order actions, working through a   plan for particular pieces of legislation that will be coming up,” he said. Stopping radical Islamic terrorists from entering the country were of “paramount importance” for the   Miller said, and said more details about Trump’s proposed actions would be revealed as the inauguration approached. The NSEERS post   program required registration and fingerprinting of Arab and Muslim immigrants from the United States, although according to the Associated Press, hadn’t been used by the Obama administration since 2011.
