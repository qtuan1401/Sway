It’s now been 260 days since Democratic presidential nominee Hillary Clinton held a press conference. [Today, Hillary Clinton’s only public event is a fundraiser with Cher in Massachusetts. The Clinton Campaign added an “organizing event” in Reno, NV on August 25th to her paltry schedule.  Hillary Clinton continues to dodge open questions in favor of heavily staged and controlled media interviews. Mired in a variety of scandals and with serious questions swirling about her health, the Clinton campaign is doing everything they can to hide Hillary from unscripted questions. Her opponent, Republican presidential nominee Donald Trump regularly gives access to the press during open press conferences. Trump is maintaining a blistering campaign schedule filled with rallies, while Clinton rarely appears in public for more than half an hour. People who would like to include their questions and comments for this daily column regarding Hillary are encouraged to tweet at this reporter @DustinStockton and use the hashtag #HidingHillary.
