Tuesday on the The Blaze Network’s “Tomi,” Glenn Beck compared Democratic presidential nominee Hillary Clinton to Argentina’s Eva Perón and Republican presidential nominee Donald Trump to Italy’s Benito Mussolini, claiming if either gets elected there will be “horrible times of revolution in the streets. ”  Beck said, “I think if she gets elected, I think we’re looking at Argentina, I think we’re looking at Evita. We’re looking at Argentina. However, I think there is also a chance if Donald Trump gets elected we are looking at Mussolini. Because we are going to go through horrible economic times and horrible times of revolution in the streets. ” “A strong man can come up, either a male or a female, it doesn’t matter,” he continued. “Communist, dictatorship, it doesn’t matter. That is the progressive choice —  a dictatorship, fascist or communist. There is no constitutionalist here. There nobody talking about the Constitution. ” He added, “As I said to my kids, either one of those end with dad in jail. ” Follow Pam Key on Twitter @pamkeyNEN
