Goldman Sachs economist Jim   O’Neill was quite notably . ” ’   Today, Goldman is betting again on emerging markets, albeit on a   select few countries and in a more cautious tone. India,   Indonesia, and Philippines are the new favorites,   which all set to become ”Asia’s next domestic   growth stories.” ’ ’  ’ ’is expected to grow at an annual rate     of 1. 5% over the coming decade in each of the three” countries     boosting their economies. Others, however, are less     optimistic about .   ’ ’  ’ ’     The second tailwind is . All     three countries today lag far behind developed countries in     terms of productivity and per capita income giving them a     chance to grow faster (from a lower base). Goldman     recommends ”[t]argeted and sustainable infrastructure     investment” to close the gap.   ’ ’     Low private sector debt is another tailwind. ”India,     Indonesia and the Philippines are starting from” Goldman says, compared to countries     like  ’ ’  ’ ’     Finally, the  protects them from external shocks. ”[T]he low        ratio in these economies mean that they are     relatively less sensitive to a slowdown in global trade or     potential trade protectionist policies under the US Trump     Administration,” according to Goldman.   ’ ’     Going forward, Goldman sounded optimistic about the pace of     reforms in all 3 countries citing ”progress on key reforms     including measures to increase infrastructure investment, ease     FDI policies, ease doing business and simplifying bureaucratic     processes.” However, it warned that ”ultimately the single     biggest driver of growth in these economies will be the extent     of reform implementation.”   ’ ’  ’ ’     Goldman also referred to favorable   factors; all 3     countries are experiencing cyclical recoveries helped by global     tailwinds (low oil prices, loose US monetary policy). But     it expects growth in Philippines to be the strongest at 6. 7%     thanks to strong private spending and India’’s expected     underperformance after the   cash     crunch. India and Indonesia, on other hand, have lagged when it     comes to encouraging private investment spending despite     favorable monetary policy ”partly due to weak capacity     utilization levels,” Goldman noted.   ’
