Jon Stewart could return to television before this year’s presidential election, HBO programming chief Casey Bloys revealed this weekend at the Television Critics Association summer press tour. [Bloys told reporters that Stewart is working on an “animated parody of a cable news network with an on   portal,” according to Variety.  The   Daily Show veteran signed an exclusive   production deal with HBO in November. Bloys said that Stewart had established an animation studio and was working with 3D graphics company Otoy on the    project. He added that the setup would allow Stewart to “comment in real time with what’s happening during the day’s news events” and “allow him to respond fairly quickly. ” The project  —   which could combine a traditional   television show with digital content  —   is expected to launch as soon as September or October, though Bloys said it could premiere later this fall. Stewart last appeared on television during last month’s Republican National Convention. He joined Stephen Colbert on CBS’ ‘Late Show’ in two segments ripping Republican presidential nominee Donald Trump. Stewart left Comedy Central’s Daily Show in August 2015 after a   period that saw him earn 22 Emmy Awards. The Daily Show and its current host Trevor Noah failed to earn an Emmy nomination this year for the first time since Stewart’s tenure as host.
