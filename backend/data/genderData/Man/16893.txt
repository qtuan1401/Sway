Thursday on CNN’s “The Lead,” Rep. Peter King ( ) said   Donald Trump’s deal to keep roughly a 1, 000 manufacturing jobs in Indiana at the Carrier factory was “sending a signal that there is a new sheriff in town. ”  King said, “I think, first of all, it’s a great step forward. And what Donald Trump is doing is he’s sending a signal that there is a new sheriff in town and he’s going to do it his way and it’s going to work. And it’s sending a signal to corporations, sending a signal to the American people that he will do things different from other presidents. Maybe like Teddy Roosevelt or Andrew Jackson, and he will get it done. ” On Sen. Bernie Sanders’ criticisms of the tax incentives, King said, “This is the ultimate in Bernie begrudgery. The fact is Donald Trump is saving the jobs. Bernie Sanders ran all over the country chasing Hillary Clinton around talking about how we have to save jobs for American workers. Donald Trump has done it. ” “This is the first day,” he continued. “He is the   not even the president yet and already he’s out there saving jobs, showing it can be done. And as much as anything, yes, it’s important for those 1, 000 people but it’s also a great symbol that Donald Trump is serious. Donald Trump will find a way to get it done. And when you make a deal, you make a deal. It will be made one way or the other. And this is a symbol, it’s metaphor, but it shows that Donald Trump is a unique person and he will get it done. ” Follow Pam Key on Twitter @pamkeyNEN
