Khaled Khatib, a Syrian rescue worker who served as a cinematographer on the   documentary short “The White Helmets,” has been barred by American officials from traveling to Los Angeles for Sunday’s Academy Awards ceremony, according to the Associated Press. The AP reported that the Department of Homeland Security blocked Mr. Khatib after discovering “derogatory information” about him. Mr. Khatib had planned to fly from Istanbul to Los Angeles on Saturday. The AP said he had been detained earlier in the week by Turkish officials for undisclosed reasons, and that he needed a passport waiver to travel to the United States, which was denied. Raed Saleh, the leader of the White Helmets, was also to attend the Oscars there was no indication that his plans were upended. Mr. Khatib had planned to attend the ceremony after the Trump administration’s travel ban was lifted. The ban had halted or slowed travel from seven   countries, including Syria, but it was frozen by the courts. A member of the White Helmets, a group that searches for survivors in the rubble of   buildings, Mr. Khatib also filmed the group’s rescue efforts for the   film, which was made for Netflix and directed by Orlando von Einsiedel. In an interview with The Times earlier this month, Mr. Khatib said he hoped his appearance at the Oscars would convey the urgent message of the movie, and pressure President Bashar  ’s regime and the Russian government to stop bombing Syrian civilians. Representatives for the filmmakers and the Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences did not immediately respond to requests for comment.
