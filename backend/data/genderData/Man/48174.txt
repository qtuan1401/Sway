’  ’ ’   Fewer than three months before the November election, GOP   presidential nominee Donald Trump    giving several speeches that included direct appeals to black   voters. ’ ’   During a campaign rally in Dimondale, Michigan, on Friday in   which the   mogul urged   to vote for   him, Trump asked rhetorically, ”What the hell do you have to   lose?” ’ ’   But critics noted that Trump chose to address black voters there   in Dimondale  —   and at another rally in West Bend, Wisconsin,   earlier in the week  —   in communities that are overwhelmingly   white. ’ ’   According to the  the city of West Bend is roughly 95% white. In   Eaton County, Michigan where Dimondale is, the population is 88%   white. ’ ’   When questioned about the disparity  former US congressman and Trump senior   adviser Jack Kingston suggested Trump should have had ”a backdrop   with a burning car” instead. ’ ”   The billionaire’s latest outreach, in which he prefaced his plea   for minority votes  has been   criticized as callous. ” ”   The Trump campaign has generally avoided reaching out to black   citizens directly. The New York businessman’s campaign received   three invitations to address the National Urban League, . The campaign ignored the   first two and declined the third. ” ’   Invitations from the National Association of Black Journalists   and the NAACP were also declined. ’ ’ ’
