Bannon  will be talking about the protests against the mere “idea” of a Donald Trump candidacy  —   from the streets of London and New York to the rallies in Arizona  —   and the proposed   during Trump’s American Israel Public Affairs Committee (AIPAC) Conference on Monday in DC. [Alex Marlow,    of Breitbart News, will appear on the program.

Other special guests include: David Webb, Breitbart California’s Joel Pollak, as well as Lee Stranahan, Dan Fleuette, and Brandon Darby who will discuss the   rallies over the weekend.
