Wednesday on NBC’s “Today,” Gov. Nikki Haley ( ) elaborated on her Republican response to last night’s State of the Union address.  Haley was asked by show   Matt Lauer if she was specifically referring to GOP presidential   Donald Trump when talking about her party’s “angriest voices,” to which she acknowledged she was indeed talking about Trump. “He was one of them, yes  —   he was one,” Haley said. “There’s other people in the media, there’s people in my state. I think we’re seeing it across the country. But yes, Mr. Trump has definitely contributed to what I think is just irresponsible talk. ” When asked if she would consider being on the Republican presidential ticket, Haley thanked House Speaker Paul Ryan and Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell for the opportunity, but would not commit to the possibility. “I know that people in the media don’t believe that, but I was given an opportunity to say what I think, and I appreciate that from Speaker Ryan and Senator McConnell,” Haley replied. “I think that that’s a big decision,” she added. “It’s a family decision. It’s a state decision. It’s something I’d have to think about. But absolutely would sit down with anyone that wanted to talk. ” Follow Jeff Poor on Twitter @jeff_poor
