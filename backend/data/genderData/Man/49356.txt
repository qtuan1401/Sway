’  ’ ’   ”Late Show” host Stephen Colbert and ”Last Week Tonight” host   John Oliver, both formerly of ”The Daily Show,” discussed their   greatest fears in the looming Trump presidency at   a fundraiser for a film festival in Colbert’’s hometown of   Montclair, New Jersey. ’ ’   During the   discussion, the duo touched on the   ”fake news” that influenced the election in comparison with the   brand of satire both men presented on ”The Daily Show” and ”The   Colbert Report,” with Colbert bemoaning his possible role in   perpetuating fictional news: ’ ’  ’ ’  ’ ’   ”Here’s why we are most screwed,” Colbert said. ”Everyone tried   to stop Trump except the people he is going to appoint, they   tried to stop Trump and they didn’t. He owes them nothing.” ’ ’   ”That’s what scares me,” said Colbert. ”He owes the checks and   balances of Washington nothing. Because they tried to stop him   and they couldn’t. And he’s a vindictive person. Merry   Christmas.” ’
