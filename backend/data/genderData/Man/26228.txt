GOP frontrunner Donald Trump said the loss of Supreme Court Justice Scalia is a “massive setback” for conservatives. [“The totally unexpected loss of Supreme Court Justice Antonin Scalia is a massive setback for the Conservative movement and our COUNTRY,” Trump posted on Twitter.  Trump also sent out a formal press release commenting on Scalia’s death: I would like to offer my sincerest condolences to the Scalia family after the passing of Justice Scalia. Justice Scalia was a remarkable person and a brilliant Supreme Court Justice, one of the best of all time. His career was defined by his reverence for the Constitution and his legacy of protecting Americans’ most cherished freedoms. He was a Justice who did not believe in legislating from the bench and he is a person whom I held in the highest regard and will always greatly respect his intelligence and conviction to uphold the Constitution of our country. My thoughts and prayers are with his family during this time. Scalia passed away on Saturday of apparent natural causes.
