A New Jersey man can now fly his ‘Trump” flag outside his home after charges were dismissed against him on Wednesday. [Joseph Hornick, who is a Donald Trump supporter, was ticketed in March for displaying a political sign, as the city ordinance allows political signs only 30 days before the election. New Jersey’s primary is June 7th.  The former firefighter faced a penalty of a $2, 000 fine or   jail sentence, but Judge Louis Garippo Jr. dismissed the charges against Hornick, calling the ordinance “somewhat vague. ” “Let the flags fly. Let ‘em fly,” Hornick stated, according to NJ. com. “You take my freedom away, I’d rather sit in jail, bottom line. ”
