Monday on Bloomberg Politics’ “With All Due Respect” broadcasted on MSNBC, political commentator and longtime Clinton ally James Carville discussed the political    between Republican presidential candidate Donald Trump, former President Bill Clinton, and his wife, Democratic presidential   Hillary Clinton and said Trump is “a man that bankrupt four companies” while former President Bill Clinton is “a man who balanced four federal budgets. ”  Carville said, “Let me put it this way about the cycle. It’s such an odd cycle, a man that bankrupt four companies is attacking a man who balanced four federal budgets. That’s about what is is. Bill Clinton —  this country owes Bill Clinton a tremendous debt of gratitude. And I think most Americans know this. They know he is a president that balanced budgets and they know Trump is a man who bankrupt companies. It’s a fact. ” Follow Pam Key on Twitter @pamkeyNEN
