CLEVELAND, Ohio  —     protest organizers’ failure to effectively mount anything resembling a popular protest against Republicans, Donald Trump, and police officers is apparently getting to them and they are lashing out angrily in the streets. [The grassroots Left rebrands itself approximately 1 year prior to each presidential election and this year they are united under the banner of “Black Lives Matter,” though they called themselves “Occupy” prior to the 2012 presidential election. The constant need to change their identity and the failure to get people in Cleveland to join their efforts have apparently left them angry and unable to control their emotions.
