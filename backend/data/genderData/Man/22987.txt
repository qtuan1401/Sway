Amish PAC endorsed Republican nominee Donald Trump and launched billboards in Lancaster, Pennsylvania  —   west of Philadelphia where the Democratic National Convention is being held this week. [“Pennsylvania has a good shot of going Republican in November and these billboards will certainly help by getting people registered and to the polls,” said Ben King, the outreach director for Amish PAC.  The goal of the billboards is to educate Amish and Mennonite voters about Trump. Roughly 95 percent of Amish and Mennonite voters are Republican.
