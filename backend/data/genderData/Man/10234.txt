Sunday on CNN’s “State of the Union,” Sen. Al Franken ( ) claimed “a few” of his Republican colleagues have expressed concerns about President Donald Trump’s mental health.  Franken said, “We all have this suspicion that, you know, he lies a lot. He says things that aren’t true. That’s the same as lying, I guess. You know, 3 to 5 million people voted illegally   …     That is not the norm for a president of the United States or actually for a human being. ” (  The Hill) Follow Pam Key on Twitter @pamkeyNEN
