Presumptive Republican nominee Donald Trump appealed to a core group of voters,   during his speech where he blasted presumptive Democratic nominee Hillary Clinton’s immigration policies on Wednesday, suggesting her policies disenfranchise minority workers. [“Hillary Clinton has put forward the most radical immigration platform in the history of the United States,” Trump stated on Wednesday morning, speaking from Trump SoHo in New York City. “She has pledged to grant mass amnesty and in her first 100 days, end virtually all immigration enforcement, and thus create totally open borders in the United States. ”  “The first victims of her radical policies will be poor   and Hispanic workers who need jobs. They are the ones she will hurt the most,” Trump charged. “Hillary’s Wall Street immigration agenda will keep immigrant communities poor, and unemployed Americans out of work. She can’t claim to care about   and Hispanic workers when she wants to bring in millions of new   workers to compete against them. ” During the primary, Clinton repeatedly won with   voters. Trump’s attack on Clinton’s immigration policies, in a move to appeal to   voters, comes after a recent Washington   News poll revealed 88 percent of voters of color have an unfavorable view of the billionaire.
