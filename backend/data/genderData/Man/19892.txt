In light of the August 9 media feeding frenzy which twisted Donald Trump’s words to allege he was urging violence against Hillary Clinton, it is interesting to note words uttered by Joe Biden in 2008, that need no twisting: that Obama would have a “problem” if he tried to take away Biden’s gun. [Biden made the statement while campaigning in Virginia.  According to Bloomberg Politics, Biden said, “I’ll guarantee, Barack Obama ain’t taking my shotgun. So don’t buy that malarkey. They’re going to start peddling that to you. ” He added, “I’ve got two, [and] if he tries to pull my Beretta he’s got a problem. ” Mark Halperin commented on the statement, highlighting that Biden and Obama were both “under U. S. Secret Service protection” at the time it was made. He said Biden’s message was clear: “Mess with my guns and you’ll have a problem. ” Halperin said Biden “should have taken heat” for that joke, but Halperin’s   Donny Deutsch, disagreed. Deutsch did, however, contend that Trump should take heat for what he said. AWR Hawkins is the Second Amendment columnist for Breitbart News and political analyst for Armed American Radio.
