’  ’ ’   The man who has been dubbed the Naked Cowboy, who often poses for   pictures with New York City tourists in Times Square, explained   in a recent interview his ”affinity” for   Donald   Trump, saying, in part, his undocumented wife’’s fear of   being deported was a good thing. ’ ’   ”I have an affinity with Trump. I get him,” the Naked Cowboy,   whose real name is Robert Burck,  for the magazine’’s   January issue. ”We’re both media promoters, media whores,   whatever you want to call it. People get hung up on political   stuff, but I don’t care. Black, white, gay, transvestite —  just   stand up and make something of yourself.” ’ ’   He continued: ”Look, my wife’s a Mexican immigrant. She still   doesn’t have her papers. Maybe she’ll be the next to be deported,   who knows? I don’t think he’d do that. But if he does, hey,   that’s fate. Plus, it’s a nice thing to have hanging over her   head  —   you know, ’’Do the dishes, or else. ’’” ’ ’   The New York City icon, known for playing his guitar nearly naked   no matter the weather, is often dressed in a pair of Fruit of the   Loom underwear with ”TRUMP” written on its rear. ’ ”   Burck has regularly performed at Trump Tower in the wake of the   billionaire’s surprise victory last month. ”
