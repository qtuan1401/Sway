The   Academy   actor praised the press and appeared grateful that the media are “finally” starting to “push back” on Trump. “But I think now they are really starting to push back, the media.   …     [F]inally they are starting to say: Come on Donald, this is ridiculous, this is nuts, this is insane,” De Niro said. Last April, De Niro endorsed Hillary Clinton’s White House bid, calling the former secretary of state “smart” and acknowledging that “she’s a woman, which is very important. ” “I think that she’s paid her dues. There are going to be no surprises, and she has earned the right to be president and the head of the country at this point,” De Niro told the Daily Beast. “It’s that simple. And she’s a woman, which is very important because her take on things may be what we need right now. ” Follow Jerome Hudson on Twitter: @jeromeehudson.
