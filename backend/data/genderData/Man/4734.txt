Donald J. Trump was officially declared the winner of the presidential election in Michigan on Monday amid calls for a recount there and in two other states. Mr. Trump, a Republican, defeated Hillary Clinton, his Democratic opponent, by 10, 704 votes in the state, or less than a quarter of a percentage point, the Michigan Board of State Canvassers announced, nearly three weeks after the Nov. 8 election. The results, should they hold, bring his Electoral College vote total to 306, well beyond the 270 needed to win. Mrs. Clinton has 232. Michigan contributed 16 electoral votes to Mr. Trump’s total. News of his victory in Michigan came as Jill Stein, the Green Party candidate, said she planned to call for a recount there after pursuing recounts in two other states. Wisconsin officials approved a timeline for a recount on Monday, and Ms. Stein is also suing for a recount in Pennsylvania, according to The Associated Press. Mr. Trump won all three states by a combined total of about 100, 000 votes.
