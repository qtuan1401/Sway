GOP frontrunner Donald Trump ripped into Ohio Gov. John Kasich, calling him “One for 41,” during Trump’s afternoon campaign rally in Warwick, Rhode Island. [“He has a news conference all the time when he’s eating,” Trump said of Kasich, referencing a news conference Kasich held while eating earlier in the day. “I have never seen a human being eat in such a disgusting fashion!”  “I say, ‘Children, small, little bites,’” Trump said about what he tells his kids on how to eat, making fun of Kasich. “This guy takes a pancake and he’s shoving it in his mouth. It’s disgusting. Do you want that for your president? I don’t think so!” “One of the things he said, you know they make a deal  …    the deal is done and this morning they talk to Kasich and he goes, ‘You know, I’m going to Indiana,’” Trump mocked of Kasich talking about campaigning in Indiana after sending out a statement that he has coordinated with Sen. Ted Cruz’s campaign to focus on Oregon and New Mexico while Cruz focuses on Indiana in order to stop Trump from obtaining 1, 237 delegates to clinch the GOP nomination. “He’s a stubborn guy,” Trump added. “He’s like if you have a child that just say, ‘I want it mommy! I don’t care mommy! I want it daddy! I don’t care, I want it! ’” “That’s all he is,” Trump mocked.
