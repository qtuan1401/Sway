”Democratic frontrunner Hillary Clinton may be strongly positioned to win her party’s nomination for president, but she came out swinging in our exclusive interview on Thursday. We sat down with Clinton after she finished a rally with students at SUNY Purchase College, just north of New York City. Our conversation came a week after the terrorist attacks in Brussels. It was also a day after Donald Trump’s controversial comments on abortion. Our conversation spanned the threat of ISIS, her thoughts on Trump’s suitability to be    the anger felt by American voters, and the good and bad of Wall Street.” ’ ’
