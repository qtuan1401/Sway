 (CNN)  Donald Trump and his family will spend Thanksgiving at his    residence in Florida, according to a spokesperson. Jason Miller told reporters that Trump plans to leave for the holiday on Tuesday afternoon from New York, and that there would be ”further updates on when he’ll return.” Asked if Trump will hold meetings while he is vacationing at    Miller didn’t respond directly. ”Hopefully, he’s eating some turkey,” Miller said, adding that it will ”be a time to get together with family and have a brief break in action.” Still, he said that there’s ”never too long of a break,” and that Trump ”wants to get right back at it,” recognizing that there is a ”finite time to get the cabinet and the administration put together.” The spokesperson repeated that a full schedule for the trip had not yet been released.
