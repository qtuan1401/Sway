.@morningmika to Trump: Start acting like an American. https:  .  Wednesday on MSNBC’s “Morning Joe,”   Mika Brzezinski expressed her frustration with Republican presidential nominee Donald Trump calling on him worry about his brand and “start acting like an American. ”  “It’s not even the lies, which are obvious and daily and weekly,” Brzezinski said. “It is his complete lack of care for people of this country. He does not have dedication to this country. He’s not driven by dedication to this country. If you saw him flippantly holding a Purple Heart and talking about it the way he did   …     What I believe is he thinks he can go back and be a big business mogul. I actually think he has crossed the line in to the area where those primary voters are going to go  —   and see him with that Purple Heart and see him talking about that family that way and they’re going to be turned off. ” “I think his brand is in jeopardy,” she added. “If he cares about anything, care about your brand and start acting like an American. ”` Follow Jeff Poor on Twitter @jeff_poor
