 (CNN) CNN’s Anderson Cooper on Tuesday night expressed surprise that   Donald Trump had the time to tweet despite the heavy burden of preparing for the presidency.  ”When I first heard that he was tweeting about something that was on this broadcast . .. I kept thinking, ’Doesn’t he have, like, a briefing book on ISIS to be reading last night?’ ” Cooper, however, went on to express joking gratitude to Trump for watching the show.  ”There’s a huge amount of information . .. for him to be absorbing now,” said Cooper, speaking on ”AC360.” ”[I] appreciate he is watching the show. . .. But what is he doing?” Trump fired off a series of tweets Monday night and Tuesday attacking CNN for accurately reporting that his unsubstantiated claims of massive vote fraud in the election were incorrect.
