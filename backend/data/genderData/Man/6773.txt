RIO DE JANEIRO  —   Simone Manuel won the   freestyle on Thursday night, becoming the first   woman to win gold in an individual swimming event. Here is a poolside view of her reaction, from the moment she realized she won until she received the gold medal on the podium, and her reflections on the race. “I was super surprised. . .. I don’t think there was a definitive point where I thought I had the race. I don’t remember much of it except the last 15 meters. I think I put my head down earlier than normal and just told myself to get my hand on the wall as fast as I possibly could. ” “The whole time I was trying not to cry. . .. But I think just hearing the national anthem and knowing you put your heart into that race and you represented your country in the best way you know how, I think that meant a lot because that was my first individual win at an international meet and it just felt great. ” “This medal is not just for me, it’s for some of the   that have come before me, have been inspirations and mentors to me. ” “Just coming into this race tonight, I kind of tried to take the weight of the black community off my shoulders, which is something I carry with me just being in this position. But I do hope that it kind of goes away. I’m super glad with the fact I can be an inspiration to others and hopefully diversify the sport. But at the same time I would like there to be a day where there are more of us and it’s not Simone, the black swimmer, because the title black swimmer makes it seem like I’m not supposed to be able to win a gold medal or I’m not supposed to be able to break records. That’s not true because I work just as hard as anybody else and I love the sport and I want to win just like everybody else. “ ..
