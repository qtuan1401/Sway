[“So here’s my question for Hillary Clinton: can you promise that not one of the five people who were granted criminal immunity will ever be allowed to serve in a Clinton Administration?” Trump stated while speaking to thousands in Novi, Michigan. “And here is the demand I am making today to President Obama: will you pledge, here and now, not to issue a pardon to Hillary Clinton and her   for their many crimes against our country and society itself?”  “No one is above the law. Not even Hillary Clinton,” he added, while referencing Clinton’s email scandal. . @costareports preview from Giuliani correct, Trump just now: pic. twitter.   —   Nick Corasaniti (@NYTnickc) September 30, 2016,  The Washington Post’s Bob Costa first reported that Trump would be making the demand.
