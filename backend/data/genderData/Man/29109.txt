Citing new data just received today, long time pollster Pat Caddell called this year’s primary, “A   moment and I think we’ve passed into something bigger,” he added. [Caddell made the comments today to Breitbart News Daily host Stephen K. Bannon.  Citing the data, said Caddell, “It’s unbelievable. This country has left the building if you will on the political establishment, on America in trouble and in decline. ” Caddell also noted that, just as with the last debate minus front runner Donald Trump, none of those themes really get “hammered” without him. “This is what it would have looked like without the insurgents having arrived,” said Caddell, meaning a 2016 Republican primary without candidates like Donald Trump, Ted Cruz and Ben Carson. Caddell predicted a big turnout in Iowa. He also cited Bernie Sanders as proof of an insurgency of sorts on the Democrat side. The entire interview can be heard below.  OO. ready( function()  ) })
