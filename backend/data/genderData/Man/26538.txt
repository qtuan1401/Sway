A poll released Saturday shows Ted Cruz with majority support  —   53 percent  —   in the Utah caucuses, as Lt. Governor Spencer Cox endorsed him and   Republicans accompanied him at rallies this weekend. [A survey by Y2 Analytics released on Saturday shows Cruz receiving 53 percent support among likely GOP   with John Kasich at 29 percent support and Trump at eleven percent. If he receives over 50 percent of the vote, Cruz will win all 40 of Utah’s delegates.  On Saturday afternoon, Cruz spoke at a rally held at Provo High School in Provo, Utah, less than an hour south of the state capital, Salt Lake City. The Texas senator addressed a packed crowd, along with Utah Senator Mike Lee, Carly Fiorina, and Glenn Beck. Drawing a contrast with Donald Trump, Cruz pledged that there are fundamental rights on which he would never compromise, specifically including that he would never negotiate on religious liberty and the Second Amendment right to bear arms. Cox announced his endorsement in a statement. It read in part, “I am supporting Ted Cruz for president because he is the strong, principled leader we need to help get our country back on track. ” The former legislator and mayor added, “Ted has unwaveringly fought for conservative principles time after time and as president he will do the same. I am asking all my fellow Utah Republicans to join me, Senator Mike Lee, and Mitt Romney in voting for Ted Cruz on Tuesday. ” Ken Klukowski is legal editor for Breitbart News.
