We want them to come in, but they’ve got to come in like you —  legally! Right? My man. Legally. ” He stated his Secret Service agents might be reluctant to allow the supporter on stage before calling him up: “Oh, I’d love to get you up on this stage. I’d love to show ’em that shirt. I dunno. These guys [pointing to security]  …     I’d love to get him up here. Can I?   …     Bring him up. He knows if he makes a move he’s gonna get clobbered by these guys. ” Trump invited Stypik to the microphone, and he said: “I came to this country when I was five years old and my dad went through hell to get us citizenship and we did it by the book. And I’m here because I’m agitated that the media does not separate legal immigration from illegal. People spill out their guts to come here legally and it’s just really a shame that they give you a bad name [addressing Trump]. You do support immigration. ”
