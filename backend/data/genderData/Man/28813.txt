On Friday’s broadcast of HBO’s “Real Time,” host Bill Maher stated that former New York City Mayor Rudy Giuliani (R) and New Jersey Governor Chris Christie were GOP nominee Donald Trump’s “Goebbels and Göring. ”  Maher said, “[H]ow about the fact that his  —   Giuliani and Chris Christie, his Goebbels and Göring  …    were all over TV saying he’s a genius. I find that so interesting, because, in 2012, when Mitt Romney was running, and it was all about the takers, the people who don’t pay any income tax, evil takers.
