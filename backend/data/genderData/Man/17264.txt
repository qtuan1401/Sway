Pat Caddell told Breitbart News Daily SiriusXm host Alex Marlow Tuesday that he believes Donald Trump voters “are much more motivated” than Democratic nominee Hillary Clinton’s supporters. [“I think he’ll win today’s voting by a large margin,” added Caddell, while acknowledging that he could not predict if it would be enough to beat early voting totals in some areas.  Monday, Caddell penned a column for Fox News, where he is a contributor, entitled “The real election surprise? The uprising of the American people”: For more than two years the American people, in a great majority, from left to right, have been in revolt against the political class and the financial elites in America. It is a revolt with historic parallels, most closely resembling the Jacksonian revolution of the 1820s. It is an uprising. It is a peaceful uprising of a people who see a country in decline and see nothing but failure in the performance of their leadership institutions. And they have signaled their intent to take back their country and to reclaim their sovereignty. Caddell said Tuesday on Breitbart News Daily, “Look, we are in an insurgency, a revolt, an uprising, as I call it. The American people have had it, and it’s interesting there’s a broad potential coalition. This is not just Left and Right. ” Caddell also said the “new paradigm” is “America out here —  the mainstream of America versus a political class which they view, Left and Right,   …     as a class of   arrogant imposers who usurp the democracy. ” Breitbart News Daily airs on SiriusXM Patriot 125 weekdays from 6:00 a. m. to 9:00 a. m.
