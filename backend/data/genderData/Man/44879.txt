’  ’ ’   Congressional lawmakers investigating former national security   adviser Michael Flynn say he may have lied in a 2016   interview with US investigators who were conducting a background   check for his security clearance renewal. ’ ’   Documents suggest that Flynn told those investigators that   during his trip to Moscow in December 2015  —   in which he was   pictured dining next to Russian President Vladimir Putin  —      he was ”paid by ’’US companies. ’’” ’ ’  ’ ’  ’ ’  ’ ’’ ’  ’ ’  ’ ”   Flynn’s payments from Russian entities have long been seen   as red flags, before and after he was appointed to Trump’s   Cabinet as the national security adviser. Flynn agreed to testify   before the House and Senate intelligence committees in late March   in exchange for immunity from prosecution, but neither committee   has agreed to that so far. ” ”   Flynn’s time at the White House lasted just 24 days. He was asked   to resign on February 13 over reports that he had discussed   sanctions with Russia’s ambassador to the US, Sergey Kislyak,   during the transition. But Trump continued to defend him, going   as far as suggesting to FBI Director James Comey the next day to   drop the investigation into Flynn’s foreign contacts, according   to a memo Comey wrote about the conversation. ” ’   After Flynn was forced out of the Trump administration, the   president continued to vigorously advocate for, and defend Flynn    —   and blamed the Obama administration for having   initially vetted Flynn for his brief     tenure  ’ ’Congressional lawmakers investigating former. ..’ ’’ ’’ ’’
