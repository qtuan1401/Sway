Sunday on CNN’s “State of the Union,” Department of Homeland Security Secretary John Kelly said President Donald Trump “will be insistent” on including funding for a U. S.  border wall in the spending bill that would keep the government from shutting down.  Partial transcript as follows: BASH: Will the President go to the mat and insist on funding his border wall as part of the stopgap government funding measure? KELLY: I think it goes without saying that the President has been pretty straightforward about his desire and the need for a border wall. So I would suspect he’ll do the right thing for sure, but I would suspect he will be insistent on the funding. Follow Pam Key on Twitter @pamkeyNEN
