Sunday on Fox News Channel’s “Fox  Friends,” Republican presidential candidate Donald Trump said his potential general election opponent Democratic presidential   Hillary Clinton is not “innocent” in her husband former president Bill Clinton’s “serious” abuse of woman.  Trump said, “Her defense is  —   she’s got a problem. She’s married to a person that’s a serious abuser and I mean, at the highest level, and she  —   you know, she’s not an innocent victim. She was the one that would go along with him in this whole game that they play. And you look at what happened with some of the people that he took advantage of and then she gets involved. So She’s not like the innocent person sitting by the side with tears in her eyes She was very much involved. ” Follow Pam Key on Twitter @pamkeyNEN
