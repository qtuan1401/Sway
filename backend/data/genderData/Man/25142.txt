Pat Caddell spoke with Breitbart News Daily host Alex Marlow on Monday, saying, “The opportunities are high” for the incoming Trump administration. Citing a nation still divided after a long political campaign season, Caddell went on to discuss the current state of the Democratic Party. [Caddell, a longtime Democrat, called it “a party hollowed out” and unable “to reach out beyond identity politics. ” They “keep falling back on the same mantras,” he said.  “The losses at the state level are devastating because that’s where you develop candidates for Congress,” he added. Caddell concluded, “What’s missing is a positive vision of restoring my party to what it once was, truly the party of the common man, as opposed to a party of   …       elites” that relies on “divisive identity politics to win. ” Breitbart News Daily airs on SiriusXM Patriot 125 weekdays from 6:00 a. m. to 9:00 a. m.
