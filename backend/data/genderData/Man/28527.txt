In a preview of a larger interview that will air during Face the Nation on January 3, Republican presidential hopeful Donald Trump said he does not like Obama’s efforts at executive gun control and is tired of people blaming guns for America’s ills. [Speaking to host John Dickerson, Trump said, “I don’t like [what Obama’s] doing. I don’t like anything having to do with changing our Second Amendment. ”  Trump said the the US already has “plenty of rules and regulations” and there are “plenty of things that [the Obama administration] can do right now that are already there. ” But he pointed out that Obama is not doing those things —  i. e. he is not enforcing the laws that are already on the books. Instead, he is seeking more and more regulations. On December 31, The Washington Times reported that gun crime convictions were down more than 33 percent in 2015 compared to where they were in 2005. Yet gun control rhetoric from Obama and his allies is up. Follow AWR Hawkins on Twitter: @AWRHawkins. Reach him directly at awrhawkins@breitbart. com.
