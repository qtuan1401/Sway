’  ’ ’   Donald Trump released a statement Saturday lambasting Hillary   Clinton for labeling half of his supporters a ”” and calling her remarks the ”worst mistake of   the political season.” ’ ’   Trump said Clinton should be ashamed of herself and suggested she   had not fully owned up to her remarks, which he called a   ”grotesque attack on American voters.” ’ ’   ”For the first time in a long while, her true feelings came out,   showing bigotry and hatred for millions of Americans,” Trump said   in his statement. ”How can she be President of our country when   she has such contempt and disdain for so many great Americans?” ’ ’   Clinton had made the comments Friday evening at a campaign event   in New York, which she partially walked back on Saturday. ’ ’   Clinton said she  but maintained   it was ”deplorable” that Trump’’s campaign had ”given a national   platform to hateful views and voices.” ’
