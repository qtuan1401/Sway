My father loved     to complain about big business and big government, but we had a     solid middle class upbringing. We had good public schools. We     had accessible health care. We had our little, you know,       house that, you know, he saved up his money, didn’t     believe in mortgages. So I lived that.

That, I     think, has probably been true for all of our history, and if     you saw the Spielberg movie, Lincoln, and how he was     maneuvering and working to get the 13th Amendment passed, and     he called one of my favorite predecessors, Secretary Seward,     who had been the governor and senator from New York, ran     against Lincoln for president, and he told Seward, I need your     help to get this done. And Seward called some of his lobbyist     friends who knew how to make a deal, and they just kept going     at it. I mean, politics is like sausage being made. It is     unsavory, and it always has been that way, but we usually end     up where we need to be. But if everybody’s watching, you know,     all of the back room discussions and the deals, you know, then     people get a little nervous, to say the least. So, you need     both a public and a private position. And finally, I think  —   I     believe in   decision making. I want to know what     the facts are. I mean, it’s like when you guys go into some     kind of a deal, you know, are you going to do that development     or not, are you going to do that renovation or not, you know,     you look at the numbers. You try to figure out what’s going to     work and what’s not going to work.

Now, that’s an oversimplification we know, but it     was the conventional wisdom. And I think that there’s a lot     that could have been avoided in terms of both misunderstanding     and really politicizing what happened with greater     transparency, with greater openness on all sides, you know,     what happened, how did it happen, how do we prevent it from     happening? You guys help us figure it out and let’s make sure     that we do it right this time.

To function effectively those markets and     the men and women who shape them have to command trust and     confidence, because we all rely on the market’s transparency     and integrity. So even if it may not be 100 percent true, if     the perception is that somehow the game is rigged, that should     be a problem for all of us, and we have to be willing to make     that absolutely clear.

Yes, he took on what he saw     as the excesses in the economy, but he also stood against the     excesses in politics. He didn’t want to unleash a lot of     nationalist, populistic reaction. He wanted to try to figure     out how to get back into that balance that has served America     so well over our entire nationhood. Today, there’s more that     can and should be done that really has to come from the     industry itself, and how we can strengthen our economy, create     more jobs at a time where that’s increasingly challenging, to     get back to Teddy Roosevelt’s square deal.

There’s nothing magic about regulations, too     much is bad, too little is bad. How do you get to the golden     key, how do we figure out what works? And the people that know     the industry better than anybody are the people who work in the     industry. And I think there has to be a recognition that, you     know, there’s so much at stake now, I mean, the business has     changed so much and decisions are made so quickly, in nano     seconds basically. We spend trillions of dollars to travel     around the world, but it’s in everybody’s interest that we have     a better framework, and not just for the United States but for     the entire world, in which to operate and trade. ” [Goldman     Sachs AIMS Alternative Investments Symposium,   ]   ’ ’     *CLINTON ADMITS NEEDING WALL STREET FUNDING*   ’ ’     *Clinton Said That Because Candidates Needed Money From Wall     Street To Run For Office, People In New York Needed To Ask     Tough Questions About The Economy Before Handing Over Campaign     Contributions. *   ’ ’     “Secondly, running for office in our country takes a lot of     money, and candidates have to go out and raise it.

So I     think that it’s something  —   I would like  —   you know, obviously     as somebody who has been through it, I would like it not to     last as long because I think it’s very distracting from what we     should be doing every day in our public business. I would like     it not to be so expensive. I have no idea how you do that. I     mean, in my campaign  —   I lose track, but I think I raised $250     million or some such enormous amount, and in the last campaign     President Obama raised 1. 1 billion, and that was before the     Super PACs and all of this other money just rushing in, and     it’s so ridiculous that we have this kind of free for all with     all of this financial interest at stake, but, you know, the     Supreme Court said that’s basically what we’re in for. So we’re     kind of in the wild west, and, you know, it would be very     difficult to run for president without raising a huge amount of     money and without having other people supporting you because     your opponent will have their supporters.

I also was     calling in ‘06, ‘07 for doing something about the mortgage     crisis, because I saw every day from Wall Street literally to     main streets across New York how a   financial     system is essential. So when I raised early warnings about     early warnings about subprime mortgages and called for     regulating derivatives and over complex financial products, I     didn’t get some big arguments, because people sort of said, no,     that makes sense.

But    —   and     I know you heard from Erskine earlier today  —   put forth the     right framework. Namely, we have to restrain spending, we have     to have adequate revenues, and we have to incentivize growth.     It’s a   formula. The specifics can be negotiated     depending upon whether we’re acting in good faith or not. And     what Senator Simpson and Erskine did was to bring Republicans     and Democrats alike to the table, and you had the full range of     ideological views from I think Tom Coburn to Dick Durbin. And     they reached an agreement. But what is very hard to do is to     then take that agreement if you don’t believe that you’re going     to be able to move the other side. And where we are now is in     this gridlocked dysfunction. So you’ve got Democrats saying     that, you know, you have to have more revenues; that’s the sine     qua non of any kind of agreement. You have Republicans saying     no, no, no on revenues; you have to cut much more deeply into     spending. Well, looks what’s happened. We are slowly returning     to growth. It’s not as much or as fast as many of us would like     to see, but, you know, we’re certainly better off than our     European friends, and we’re beginning to, I believe, kind of     come out of the long aftermath of the ‘08 crisis.

The specifics can be negotiated and     argued over. But you got to do all three. You have to restrain     spending, you have to have adequate revenues, and you have to     have growth.

And That Was True Across The U. S.

And that was true across the U. S.     government. And we knew it was going on when I would go to     China, or I would go to Russia, we would leave all of our     electronic equipment on the plane, with the batteries out,     because this is a new frontier. And they’re trying to find out     not just about what we do in our government. They’re trying to     find out about what a lot of companies do and they were going     after the personal emails of people who worked in the State     Department. So it’s not like the only government in the world     that is doing anything is the United States. But, the United     States compared to a number of our competitors is the only     government in the world with any kind of safeguards, any kind     of checks and balances. They may in many respects need to be     strengthened and people need to be reassured, and they need to     have their protections embodied in law. But, I think turning     over a lot of that material intentionally or unintentionally,     because of the way it can be drained, gave all kinds of     information not only to big countries, but to networks and     terrorist groups, and the like. So I have a hard time thinking     that somebody who is a champion of privacy and liberty has     taken refuge in Russia under Putin’s authority. And then he     calls into a Putin talk show and says, President Putin, do you     spy on people? And President Putin says, well, from one     intelligence professional to another, of course not.

And after the war when     soldiers came back and went back into the market there was a     lot of competition, because the economy was so heated up. So     that model continued. And then of course our large labor unions     bargained for healthcare with the employers that their members     worked for. So from the early 1940s until the early 1960s we     did not have any Medicare, or our program for the poor called     Medicaid until President Johnson was able to get both passed in     1965. So the employer model continued as the primary means by     which working people got health insurance. People over 65 were     eligible for Medicare. Medicaid, which was a partnership, a     funding partnership between the federal government and state     governments, provided some, but by no means all poor people     with access to healthcare. So what we’ve been struggling with     certainly Harry Truman, then Johnson was successful on Medicare     and Medicaid, but didn’t touch the employer based system, then     actually Richard Nixon made a proposal that didn’t go anywhere,     but was quite far reaching. Then with my husband’s     administration we worked very hard to come up with a system,     but we were very much constricted by the political realities     that if you had your insurance from your employer you were     reluctant to try anything else. And so we were trying to build     a universal system around the   system. And indeed     now with President Obama’s legislative success in getting the     Affordable Care Act passed that is what we’ve done. We still     have primarily an   system, but we now have people     able to get subsidized insurance. So we have health insurance     companies playing a major role in the provision of healthcare,     both to the employed whose employers provide health insurance,     and to those who are working but on their own are not able to     afford it and their employers either don’t provide it, or don’t     provide it at an affordable price. We are still struggling.     We’ve made a lot of progress. Ten million Americans now have     insurance who didn’t have it before the Affordable Care Act,     and that is a great step forward. (Applause.) And what we’re     going to have to continue to do is monitor what the costs are     and watch closely to see whether employers drop more people     from insurance so that they go into what we call the health     exchange system. So we’re really just at the beginning. But we     do have Medicare for people over 65. And you couldn’t, I don’t     think, take it away if you tried, because people are very     satisfied with it, but we also have a lot of political and     financial resistance to expanding that system to more people.     So we’re in a learning period as we move forward with the     implementation of the Affordable Care Act. And I’m hoping that     whatever the shortfalls or the glitches have been, which in a     big piece of legislation you’re going to have, those will be     remedied and we can really take a hard look at what’s     succeeding, fix what isn’t, and keep moving forward to get to     affordable universal healthcare coverage like you have here in     Canada.
