A new survey reveals that most voters are not knowledgeable on key election issues, as the results show voters gave an incorrect answer 52 percent of the time when questioned about key policies. [Just Facts questioned 700 people that said they vote in “most” elections about key election issues such as: healthcare, education, taxes, government spending, pollution, the national debt, global warming, Social Security, hunger, and energy.  Voters only gave the right answer 35 percent of the time, according to the results. “These poor results indicate that many voters may be casting ballots based on warped notions of reality,” notes Just Facts’s press release. “In total, the rates at which voters gave the correct answers varied from a high of 43% for Trump voters to a low of 31% for Clinton voters,” reported Just Facts, noting: 43% for Trump voters. 37% for 35 to 64 year olds. 37% for males. 35% for undecided voters. 34% for females. 34% for 65+ year olds. 31% for Clinton voters. Conquest Communications Group conducted the national survey from Oct. 11 through Oct. 23. The results have a margin of error of plus or minus four percent.
