’  ’ ’   Donald Trump is getting slammed from all corners Friday, and the   latest Democrat to target him was Sen. Elizabeth Warren. ’ ’   Coming off what some polls showed was  Trump spent several days defending his   treatment of women. ’ ’   The woman  is former Miss Universe winner,   Alicia Machado. Machado has been campaigning on behalf of   Clinton. ’ ”   Clinton invoked Machado’s name at the end of the debate at   Hofstra University on Monday, setting off a   crusade led   by Donald Trump, in which the Republican presidential nominee   . ” ”   He later turned against Machado  as evidence of what he   calls Clinton’s bad judgment. ” ’’ ’   The   mogul’’s ongoing tirade didn’’t go unnoticed.   Clinton  saying Trump’’s     tweeting about Machado was ”unhinged, even for” him. In response,   Trump characterized his midnight missives as a presidential   virtue,    ”at least you know I will be there, awake, to answer the call!” ’ ’   Warren of Massachusetts, a frequent critic of Trump, apparently   wasn’’t moved by his reasoning. In a series of tweets on Friday,   Warren    ”Is this what keeps you up at night, Donald Trump? Thinking of   new & interesting ways to call women fat or ugly or sluts?” ’ ’   ”You never tweet at 3am with ways to help students getting   crushed by debt or seniors struggling on Social Security,” Warren   continued. ”You never tweet at 3am with ways to create new jobs   for workers or hold Wall Street accountable.” ’
