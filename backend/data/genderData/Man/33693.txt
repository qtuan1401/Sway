Married to Ivanka Trump, Kushner has emerged in the opening weeks of the Trump administration as one of the president’s closest confidantes. Since taking office, Trump has spoken infrequently about Iraq or his policy there. His comments last week that the United States is ”doing very well in Iraq,” which remains besieged by violence, drew particular notice and criticism. The visit by Kushner comes after US military officials acknowledged that the United States was likely behind an airstrike that killed scores of Iraqi civilians in Mosul on March 17. The incident renewed concern about civilian deaths in the wake of the   air campaign against ISIS. CORRECTION: An earlier version of this story prematurely reported Kushner’s arrival.
