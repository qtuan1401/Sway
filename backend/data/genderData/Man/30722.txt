Nolan D. McCaskill writes at Politico:  Donald Trump unleashed a barrage of attacks on Hillary Clinton on Friday, hitting her on everything from her political talent to her ties to President Barack Obama, tying it all back to a central message: His likely opponent would make a terrible president. “If you choose Hillary Clinton, this country is gonna die. It’s gonna die,” Trump said during a rally in Redding, California. “She’s not respected by other countries. ” After the Democratic  ’s blistering rebuke of Trump’s foreign policy on Thursday in which she warned that his election would be “a historic mistake” and declared him “temperamentally unfit” for the White House, Trump fired back. “Frankly, I honestly believe  —   and I really mean this  —   I think that Hillary Clinton is unfit to lead our country, certainly at this time,” Trump said. “I think she’s unfit. She doesn’t have what it takes. ” The real estate mogul dismissed Clinton’s criticism of his temperament, arguing that his is strong as he derided the former secretary of state. “’I don’t like his temperament I don’t like his tone,’” Trump said, mocking his likely general election opponent. “Let me tell you, there’s nobody with a better temperament than me. I have a temperament for winning. I’ve won all my life, and we’re gonna start winning for you, OK?” You can read the rest of the story here.
