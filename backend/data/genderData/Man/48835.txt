’  ’ ’   Sen. Ted Cruz on Sunday appeared to accuse NBC of intentionally   withholding tapes containing material far worse than    lewd comments Donald Trump made in 2005   boasting about forcing himself on women. ’ ’   Cruz asked in a tweet why NBC hadn’’t released      videos of the Republican presidential nominee on ”The   Apprentice,” a reality show that he starred in for over a decade. ’ ’   Following Friday’’s release of audio in which Trump bragged   about kissing and grabbing women without their permission, Bill   Pruitt, a former producer on the show, said that there are   ”” comments Trump made on tape. ’ ’   ”NBC had tape 11 yrs. Apprentice producer says they have more   & worse. So why not release in 2015? In March? Why wait till   October? #MSMBias”  referencing supposed bias towards Trump in the   mainstream media. ’ ’   Cruz won the second most amount of states and delegates in the   Republican presidential primary before dropping out of the race   earlier this spring, essentially ceding the nomination to Trump. ’ ’’ ”   But the senator’s theory appears flawed. ” ’   Following Friday’’s release of the audio, the network  that it did not have the tapes of ”The Apprentice,”   and that the tapes are instead owned by Mark Burnett, who   produced the show and is friendly with Trump. Reporters at the   network itself acquired the tape released Friday several days   before the story broke,  by The Washington Post while network lawyers   reviewed the material.  ’
