Sheriff Clarke: Black Lives Matter’s Hateful   Sentiment Fueling Rage Against American Police Officers: Update 11:20 pm ET: Fireworks on CNN as Milwaukee County Sheriff David Clarke tells Don Lemon that the “  sentiment” from “this hateful ideology called Black Lives Matter has fueled this rage against the American police officer. ” Sheriff Clarke says he predicted all of this two years ago. A stunned Lemon wants none of it and essentially calls a   time out and goes to commercial. When they return, Clarke denounces Black Lives Matter agitators for preaching “vile and vitriol in the name of virtue” and says there is only one group in America that truly cares about the lives of black people in urban ghettos —  police officers. Clarke says the American police officer is the one who goes out there on a daily basis to protect the lives of black people.
