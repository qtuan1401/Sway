On this weekend’s broadcast of “Fox News Sunday,”   Donald Trump’s incoming chief of staff, Reince Priebus said the intelligence community has “been all over the map” about Russia’s hacking interference in the 2016 presidential election.  Priebus said Trump would accept a conclusion if there was a consensus report from the intelligence community and explained,  “I think that these guys should be straight with the American people and come out and say it. I don’t think they’ve been clear about it. I think it’s been all over the map. ” Follow Pam Key on Twitter @pamkeyNEN
