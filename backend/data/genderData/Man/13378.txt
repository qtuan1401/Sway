On Friday’s broadcast of the Fox News Channel’s “America’s Newsroom,” Senator Ted Cruz ( ) said that “there’s no good answer to Syria right now. ”  Cruz said, “[T]he honest answer is, there’s no good answer to Syria right now. And after eight years of Obama broken red lines and weakness, we’ve seen Syria turned into a war zone that has resulted in hundreds of thousands of refugees, of chemical weapons, it is a bad situation. ” He added that a   zone in Syria “can be very dangerous. I think that invites conflicts with other nations. ” He further stated that while Assad is “a monster. ” “[I]t would be even worse if those chemical weapons fall into the hands of radical Islamic terrorists, if they fall into the hands of ISIS or al Qaeda, or al Nusra. ” Cruz concluded that he was “encouraged” by the Trump administration’s foreign policy and national security.
