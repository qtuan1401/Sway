President Trump cracks joke at National Prayer Breakfast: Let’s pray for @Schwarzenegger’s ’Apprentice’ ratings https:  .  pic. twitter.  Thursday at the National Prayer Breakfast, President Donald Trump opened his remarks with a joke about the ratings of NBC’s “The Apprentice” with Arnold Schwarzenegger as the host.  “When I ran for president, I had to leave the show,” Trump said. “That’s when for sure I knew I was doing it. And they hired a big movie star, Arnold Schwarzenegger to take my place. And we know how that turned out. The ratings went right down the tubes. It’s been a total disaster. And Mark will never ever bet against Trump again and I just want to pray for Arnold if we can  —   for those ratings, OK?” Follow Jeff Poor on Twitter @jeff_poor
