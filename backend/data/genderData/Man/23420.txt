Presumptive Republican nominee Donald Trump is pushing back against a report from the Washington Post that claims Trump surrogate Dr. Ben Carson revealed Trump’s top five picks for vice president. [“The @washingtonpost report on potential VP candidates is wrong. Marco Rubio and most others mentioned are NOT under consideration,” Trump later posted on Twitter.  Former Alaska Gov. Sarah Palin, who ran as VP with Sen. John McCain in 2008, was on the list, according to Carson. Others included: Sen. Ted Cruz, Ohio Gov. John Kasich, Sen. Marco Rubio, and New Jersey Gov. Chris Christie. Carson reportedly revealed the list to the Washington Post during a car ride to a TV appearance.
