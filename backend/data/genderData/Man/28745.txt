LOS ANGELES, California  —   Thousands of   protesters marched downtown Wednesday night and blocked traffic on the 101 Freeway to show their displeasure at Donald Trump’s election as President of the United States. [“This is not something you would ever see in L. A.,” said the CBS Los Angeles reporter on the scene.  The Los Angeles protest is just one of many around the country in major cities. Earlier Wednesday, in the wee hours of the morning, riots broke out in several West Coast cities, and on college campuses, as Hillary Clinton supporters struggled to deal with the election result. In her concession speech on Wednesday morning in New York  —   delayed from the night before, when Clinton campaign chair John Podesta appeared to reject defeat  —   Hillary Clinton urged Americans to accept the election result: We have seen that our nation is more deeply divided than we thought. But I still believe in America and I always will. And if you do, then we must accept this result and then look to the future. Donald Trump is going to be our president. We owe him an open mind and the chance to lead. Our constitutional democracy enshrines the peaceful transfer of power and we don’t just respect that, we cherish it. It also enshrines other things the rule of law, the principle that we are all equal in rights and dignity, freedom of worship and expression. We respect and cherish these values too and we must defend them. CBS Los Angeles reports that Wednesday evening’s protests are still “mostly peaceful,” though they involved vandalism. The 101 Freeway is a major   artery connecting downtown Los Angeles to Ventura via the San Fernando Valley. Photo credit: @4n0nc47   Twitter, Joel B. Pollak is Senior    at Breitbart News.
