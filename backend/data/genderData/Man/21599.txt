Friday on MSNBC’s “Morning Joe,” while commenting on several state polls showing a surge for Republican presidential nominee Donald Trump “Meet The Press,” host Chuck Todd said while the third party candidates are losing ground, “What is mildly surprising is that Trump is benefiting in some of those places more so than Clinton. ”  Todd said, “One of the reasons why Trump’s numbers have gained a little bit is in some places you do see Republicans coming home. That’s one of the things you noticed there. The other part of is there’s one consistency in all of those new state polls and that’s the two third party candidates are losing ground. What is mildly surprising is that Trump is benefiting in some of those places more so than Clinton. Particularly if you look at the two Colorado polls. ” “There’s a second one that shows her with a slightly bigger lead but in each case you see third party candidates sort of fading a little bit,” he continued. “That’s something to watch for after Monday night, without Gary Johnson getting into the debate, I think you probably will see more fading of those third party numbers and then we’ll know for sure how many are moderate Republicans who will they be convinced that Trump is Republican enough for them. And then you’ll see gains for him. Or do those folks who are sitting in Johnson say after the first debate say, you know what? Temperament is everything. I’m reluctantly go with Clinton. ” Follow Pam Key on Twitter @pamkeyNEN
