Casey Anthony, the Florida woman acquitted in 2011 for the death of her    daughter, was spotted protesting President Donald Trump on Saturday outside of his    resort.  Anthony was among the crowd of an estimated 3, 000 people. She declined to speak on camera, but did tell WPTV news that she is against the president’s policies.
