Just to be very honest with you, I think very few people thought Trump would win. They were in defense mode, as to what are we going to do if Hillary wins this thing, and then when, fortunately, Trump won, everything started changing rapidly. ” Hice added that there are multiple plans to replace Obamacare, and he is confident it will get done.
