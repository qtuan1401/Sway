’  ’ ’   Donald Trump embraced the latest wave of ”lock her up” chants   directed at Hillary Clinton at a Monday rally in Ambridge,   Pennsylvania, less than   after suggesting the Democratic   nominee would ”be in jail” during his administration. ’ ’   ”Special prosecutor, here we come, Right?” Trump said as the   crowd began a ”lock her up” chant. ’ ’   ”If I win, we’’re going to appoint a special prosecutor,” Trump   followed up. ”Because we cannot allow this to happen in our   country.” ’ ’ Trump said Clinton owed the country an apology for the   ”33, 000 emails you deleted.” ’ ’   ”If I win, I am going to instruct my attorney general to get a   special prosecutor to look into your situation,” Trump said at   the town   debate. ”Because there have never been so   many lies, so much deception. And we’’re going to have a special   prosecutor.” ’ ’’ ’   Clinton said everything Trump said was ”absolutely false” but she   was ”not surprised.” ’ ’   ”Oh really?” Trump interjected. ’ ’   Clinton then mentioned the difficulty in   Trump, to   which he capped off the exchange by saying ”you’’d be in jail”   during his potential administration. ’ ’   Clinton was investigated by the FBI for using a private email   server while she was secretary of state. The FBI did not   recommend charges against Clinton despite saying she handled   classified information ”extremely carelessly.” ’
