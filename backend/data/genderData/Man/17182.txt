GOP frontrunner Donald Trump said America can’t let Democrat frontrunner Hillary Clinton become president during his afternoon campaign rally in Poughkeepsie, New York on Sunday afternoon. [On Saturday, Trump dubbed the former Secretary of State and First Lady “Crooked Hillary,” while referencing his rival Sen. Ted Cruz ( ) who he calls “Lyin’ Ted,” during a rally in Watertown, NY. Trump stuck with the new moniker on Sunday, as its use prompted a response during Sunday morning’s political talk shows.  STEPHANOPOULOS: That’s the new nickname, Crooked Hillary. Your response? CLINTON: I don’t respond to Donald Trump and his string of insults, uh, about me. I can take care of myself. I look forward to running against him if he turns out to be the Republican nominee if I am the Democratic nominee. What I’m concerned about is how he goes after everybody else. He goes after women. He goes after Muslims. He goes after immigrants. He goes after people with disabilities. He is hurting our unity at home. Uh, he is undermining the values that we stand for in New York and across America. And he’s hurting us around the world. He can say whatever he wants to say about me. I really could care less. Trump, who attacked Clinton in 2015 for abetting her husband’s treatment of women, continued the new line of attack on her ethics Sunday. “She’s been crooked from the beginning. And to think, she has shot of being our president?” he mocked. “Crooked Hillary Clinton. We can’t let it happen!” The real estate mogul also went after Clinton on Twitter earlier in the day. Crooked Hillary Clinton is spending a fortune on ads against me. I am the one person she doesn’t want to run against. Will be such fun!  —   Donald J.
