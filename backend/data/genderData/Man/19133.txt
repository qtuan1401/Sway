The latest   Consult poll finds nearly half of respondents think widespread voter fraud may take place on election day. [Voter intimidation,   voting, and people fraudulently casting ballots for dead people are all on voters’ minds.   Despite concerns about widespread voting fraud, 68 percent of respondents said the losing candidate should accept the results of the election. Only seven percent of Clinton supporters said the losing candidate should challenge the results, while 24 percent of Trump supporters said the same. Another   Consult poll found that 41 percent believe the election could be “stolen” from Trump, including 73 percent of Republicans, and 17 percent of Democrats. Sixty percent of respondents said Trump would be right to question the election’s results. Pollsters questioned 1, 395 likely voters and 1, 598 registered voters from Oct. 19 to Oct. 20. The poll’s margin of error is plus or minus three percentage points.
