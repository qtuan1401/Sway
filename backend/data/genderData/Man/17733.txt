Comedian George Lopez may be one of the few celebrities who could acutally keep his promise to leave the United States following Donald Trump’s historic presidential election victory earlier this month. [During an encounter with TMZ on Sunday at Los Angeles International Airport, the comedian was asked whether he would give Trump a “chance,” as his fellow comedian Dave Chappelle suggested he would do while hosting Saturday Night Live this week.  “I’ll give him a chance to suck my ass,” Lopez replied.  Last year Lopez became one of the first celebrities to threaten to leave the country if Trump won the election. “If he wins, he won’t have to worry about immigration. We’ll all go back,” the Latino comedian and TV star told TMZ just weeks after Trump announced his presidential bid. On Sunday, Lopez hinted that he may already have set plans in motion to leave the country following Trump’s victory Tuesday night. “Listen, I’m in escrow. Don’t worry about my residential status,” he told the outlet. “And I’m not going to tell you where I’m going to go, it’ll drive up real estate prices. Because in a f*cking year, nobody’s going to want to be here. ” Lopez also joked that he had stopped eating the snack food Cheetos: “Anything orange I don’t want,” he said. In April, Lopez endorsed former Democratic presidential candidate Bernie Sanders but said he feared he could not support the Vermont Senator’s tax proposal. “I endorsed Bernie Sanders, but really just to  …     I mean, it’s cool,” Lopez said on BigBoyTV. “I can’t pay any more taxes it’s ridiculous. But, so, we’ll figure it out. I really just did it to get the awareness out and have people vote. ”   Follow Jerome Hudson on Twitter @jeromeehudson
