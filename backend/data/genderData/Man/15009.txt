HENIN BEAUMONT, France (AP)  —   Topless demonstrators from the Femen activist group have caused a commotion as they staged a stunt against Marine Le Pen outside a polling station where the presidential candidate was heading to vote. [Around six topless Femen activists were detained Sunday morning after jumping out of an SUV limo wearing masks of Le Pen and United States President Donald Trump. Police and security forces quickly forced them into police vans, confiscating their signs. Le Pen voted at the station shortly after without further disruption. The election is taking place amid heightened security. The government has mobilized more than 50, 000 police and gendarmes to protect polling stations.
