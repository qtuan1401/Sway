(Want to get this briefing by email? Here’s the  .) Good evening. Here’s the latest. 1. “Can we do this? Can we find the character, as Americans, to open our hearts to each other?” For the 11th time in his tenure, President Obama sought to offer comfort and a way forward after a mass killing. At a memorial for five Dallas officers targeted by a black Army veteran, he praised the city as a model for progressive policing and said the country’s racial tensions could be overcome. “I’m here to insist that we are not so divided as we seem,” he said. Former President George W. Bush also spoke of healing. “To renew our unity we only have to remember our values,” he said. _____ 2. The memorial paused for a long ovation for the Dallas police chief, David Brown, who has become the face not only of the city’s grief but the voice of national police frustration. He expressed his feelings for his force and their sacrifice with the lyrics to the Stevie Wonder song “As. ” “I’ll be loving   the rainbow burns the stars out in the   the ocean covers every mountain high,” he read. _____ 3. The family of Philando Castile, who was killed by a Minnesota police officer during a traffic stop, called for a special prosecutor to take over the case. He was one of two black men shot by police officers last week in killings that drew widespread attention. _____ 4. “Secretary Clinton has won the Democratic nominating process,” Bernie Sanders told a cheering crowd in New Hampshire. In his endorsement, intended in part to coax his 13 million voting supporters into Hillary Clinton’s camp, he denounced Donald Trump as much as he praised her. “You were great, so great,” Mrs. Clinton told Mr. Sanders after they shared a hug. Her campaign is looking at a retired admiral and former top NATO commander, James Stavridis, as a possible vice president. _____ 5. Mr. Trump said he would announce his choice of a running mate by Friday. He’s been considering Gov. Chris Christie retired Lt. Gen. Michael T. Flynn Senator Joni Ernst Gov. Mike Pence the former Speaker Newt Gingrich and two unknowns  —   none of them seen as the party’s top stars. He also criticized Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg for her recent harsh criticism of his candidacy, calling her engagement in politics “a disgrace” to the Supreme Court. Meanwhile, the most vulnerable   Republican candidates are trying to escape Mr. Trump’s shadow. _____ 6. U. S. stocks had a particularly good day. The Dow closed at a record high, and the S. P. 500 logged a second strong day. The Nasdaq, heavily weighted with technology and biotech stocks, erased its losses for the year. But the embrace of risk did nothing to raise historically low bond yields. _____ 7. Major League Baseball’s   game is tonight in San Diego. The National League’s team is rich with Chicago Cubs, including the full starting infield. Johnny Cueto of the San Francisco Giants pitches. Pitching for the American League team: Chris Sale of the Chicago White Sox. (8 p. m. Eastern, Fox). _____ 8. “It’s an overwhelming victory. ” That’s a lawyer for the Philippines, saluting an international tribunal’s sweeping ruling against China’s territorial claims in the South China Sea. But tensions are hardly over. There is no mechanism to enforce the decision, and China’s Foreign Ministry said, “China does not accept or recognize” it. _____ 9. The House may vote this week on a bill requiring that most foods containing genetically engineered ingredients be identified. One of our   articles today looks at the myths and mysteries of G. M. O. s. For instance, mushrooms genetically modified not to easily bruise don’t have to be labeled, because no DNA from another organism was added. And Japan’s square watermelons have nothing to do with genetic manipulation  —   they’re just grown in boxes. _____ 10. Finally, it’s moving day for David Cameron. The British prime minister is vacating 10 Downing St. in a hurry. The home secretary Theresa May, is to succeed him on Wednesday, just two days after she won the Conservative Party’s leadership contest. Above, she walked past the only member of the household remaining behind: Larry the Cat, also known as chief mouser to the cabinet office. _____ Your Evening Briefing is posted at 6 p. m. Eastern.
