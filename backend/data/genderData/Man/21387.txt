Economist and former Wall Street Journal editorial board member Stephen Moore believes Donald Trump’s “strongest moment was when he started out saying this economy is severely under performing” during Monday night’s presidential debate. [Moore, one of over 300 economists who signed a letter detailing why Hillary Clinton’s economic policies are bad for the country, couldn’t keep from chastising NBC’s Lester Holt for what he saw as a biased performance.  “I thought Lester Holt, by the way, was extremely biased in his questions. I was frustrated to no end by that,” he said Tuesday morning on SiriusXM’s Breitbart News Daily. “He started out by saying how wonderful the economy is doing and Trump had to sort of correct him and say, what are you talking about, this is the weakest recovery since the Great Depression. We’ve still got forty million people in poverty in this country and people outside of New York and Washington and Silicon Valley are really hurting. ” “I thought Trump was very strong on that and very strong on tax cuts,” added Moore. The letter that he and over 300 other economists signed can be found in full here. Statement by economists concerned by Hillary Clinton’s economic agenda, The outcome of this year’s presidential election will influence the U. S. economy for years to come. Should Hillary Clinton win that election, her outdated policy prescriptions won’t return our economy to the faster growth rates it once enjoyed. And without more economic growth, her agenda won’t result in more jobs or a higher national standard of living. Hillary Clinton’s economic agenda is wrong for America. The U. S. economy is underperforming. Misguided federal policies have produced one of the slowest recoveries on record. Since early 2009, the economy has grown at an average annual rate of 2 percent. It could and should be growing 3 to 4 percent. Breitbart News Daily airs on SiriusXM Patriot 125 weekdays from 6:00 a. m. to 9:00 a. m. EST. LISTEN:
