Sunday on ABC’s “This Week,” Democratic presidential   Hillary Clinton said Republican presidential   Donald Trump was “undermining the values we stand for. ”  When asked to respond to Trump calling her “crooked Hillary,” Clinton said, “I don’t respond to Donald Trump and his string of insults about me. I can take care of myself. I look forward to running against him if he turns out to be the Republican nominee. If I’m the Democratic nominee. What  I’m concerned about is how he goes after everybody else. He goes after women, Muslims. he goes after immigrants, people with disabilities. He is hurting our unity at home. He’s undermining the values we stand for in New York, and across America. And he’s hurting us around the world. He can say whatever he wants to say about me. I really could care less. I’m going to stay focused on the issues. There are stark differences to where I think our country should be headed and where he would turn us back. When I talk about jobs, climate change, when I talk about equal pay, a woman’s right to make her own health care decisions and so much else, I know that he doesn’t believe any of that. And that, in in campaign, he wants to set Americans against each other. I’m not going to stand for it. ” Follow Pam Key on Twitter @pamkeyNEN
