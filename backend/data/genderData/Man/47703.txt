’  ’ ”   Conservative author Ann Coulter, an outspoken Donald Trump   supporter, doesn’t like any of the names being floated as the   Manhattan billionaire’s possible running mate. ” ’   Former House Speaker Newt Gingrich and Govs. Mike Pence of   Indiana and Chris Christie of New Jersey are all bad ideas,   Coulter told Business Insider on Tuesday. ’ ’   She presented her theory on what she believes is really   happening. ’ ’   ”I suspected it with Newt, and when he started talking about   Pence I became convinced he’’s just throwing out absurd names so   that when he finally presents his vice president we’’ll all be so   relieved,” she said. ”’’Oh, at least it’’s not Newt  —   at least it’’s   not Pence.” ’ ”   Her choice for the role? Kansas Secretary of State Kris Kobach,   an early Trump supporter  of the Manhattan billionaire’s plan to build   a massive wall along the   border. ” ’’ ’   ”He’’s no Sarah Palin  —   he’’ll open his mouth and they’’ll find out   he’’s not Sarah Palin or Dan Quayle,” Coulter said, referring to   John McCain’’s running mate in 2008 and George H. W. Bush’’s vice   president. ”His issue is immigration. He’’s tall, he’’s young, he’’s    . But he could just be head of homeland security. I’’d   be OK with that.” ’ ”   Coulter’s second choice was Scott Brown, the former Massachusetts   senator who became the first person who served in the Senate to   publicly endorse Trump. ” ’   She said pitched the ideas ”to everyone I know who knows Trump,   who can get to Trump, and to Trump himself.” ’ ’   ”Oh I’’ve done everything,” she said. ”I’’ve sent carrier pigeons.” ’ ”   Trump’s decision is considered to be imminent. He met with Pence   in Indiana alongside his family Wednesday and was set to meet   later with Gingrich. ”
