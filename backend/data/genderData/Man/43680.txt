Robert Harward on   Monday,  to Tom Ricks at Foreign Policy. At the time, the   former Navy SEAL commander told the president he’’d need some time   to ”think it over.” ’ ”   Now Harward has apparently said no to the offer, and Trump has   asked him to return to the White House to see if his mind can be   changed, according to FT’s sources. ” ”   CBS News’ Major Garrett    confirmed the report. ” ’   The White House did not immediately respond to a request for   comment. ’ ’’ ”   Two administration officials  to The Washington Post that Harward   was at the top of Trump’s   short list to replace   Michael Flynn, who abruptly resigned from the role  that he had discussed sanctions   with Russia’s ambassador to the US before Trump’s inauguration.   Flynn  the ambassador, Sergey Kislyak, not to   overreact to the latest round of sanctions imposed by the Obama   administration, indicating that incoming administration might be   more inclined to roll them back. ” ’   Harward, a former Navy SEAL commander  of US Central Command   before retiring in 2013, wanted to bring in his own staff   for a ”housecleaning” of the National Security Council, according   to Ricks. ’ ’   One of FT’’s sources said Harward was concerned about whether he   could carry out his ”housecleaning” of NSC staff, many of whom   were loyal to Flynn. ’ ’   In that role, Harward would have had a close ally in Defense   Secretary Jim Mattis, whom he served under at Central Command. He   also has NSC experience, having served on the council during the   George W. Bush administration. ’ ’   Retired Army Gen.  ’ ’The retired admiral President Donald Trump. ..’ ’’ ’’ ’’
