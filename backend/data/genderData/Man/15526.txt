@AnnCoulter Jan. 1 (one year ago) HAPPY NEW YEAR! Highlights: The Obamas hire a moving company the   lawsuit, Donors v Jeb and of course   …       Trump!  @AnnCoulter Jan. 12  …     even GOP response to Obama’s SOTU is a paean to immigrants. And GOP can’t figure out why Trump is sweeping the country. @AnnCoulter Jan. 12Trump should deport Nikki Haley. @AnnCoulter Jan. 15Bush campaign lands the coveted Lindsey Graham endorsement, bringing an additional 0. 0% support to the juggernaut that is Jeb! @AnnCoulter Jan. 26Recall: Rubio was not asked about his single legislative accomplishment  —   amnesty bill  —   until the SIXTH debate. @AnnCoulter Jan. 30Sweaty little liar Rubio sucks up to Iowans with Jesus talk, but he tried to replace them with 30 million Mexicans. @AnnCoulter Jan. 30Rubio’s immigration bill issued 33 MILLION green cards in 10 yrs  —   or 271 new immigrants for every 1 GOP   in Iowa. @AnnCoulter Feb. 1Trump is the leading GOP   tonight, among    candidates. @AnnCoulter Feb. 6Assume Fox News is declaring Rubio “winner!” @AnnCoulter Feb. 9MSNBC reporting Trump won EVERY SINGLE DEMOGRAPHIC in NH: conservatives, independents, Repubs, college ed, no college ed, religious, etc. @AnnCoulter Feb. 17Hey South Carolina! The woman who ripped down your Confederate symbols  demands no pause in Muslim immigration just endorsed Marco Rubio. @AnnCoulter Feb. 20Tonight is the night Trump won the nomination. I love you Iowa, but you embarrassed yourself again. @AnnCoulter Feb. 24Everyone’s asking Rubio if there are any states he could actually WIN. You bet there are! Sinaloa? Chiapas? Jalisco? Maybe even Oaxaca. @AnnCoulter Feb. 26BREAKING NEWS! LUNTZ FOCUS GROUP SAYS RUBIO WON DEBATE!? DRUDGE POLL: TRUMP 60. 63% CRUZ 18. 72% RUBIO 14. 42% @AnnCoulter Feb. 26Meanwhile, the “bombshell” in Trump’s tax returns appears to be his paying for Mitt Romney’s sex change operation. @AnnCoulter March 1So far, Marco Rubio has won precisely the same number of GOP primaries all year as Evander Holyfield. @AnnCoulter March 2New   PAC hires former Bush campaign flack Tim Miller. That’ll do the trick   …     especially if he brings Jeb! ’s exclamation point. @AnnCoulter March 11For those who like their daily Hitler analogy: Lefty brownshirts just forced cancellation of a peaceful Trump rally in Chicago. @AnnCoulter March 11Anyone else notice the Mexican flags being waved by the   Chicago mob? @AnnCoulter March   fascists violently shut down a peaceful Trump rally last night  Cruz + the entire media took the animals’ side. @AnnCoulter March 12Kasich’s threat not to support Trump as nominee has left America puzzled. On street corners everywhere you hear: “Who’s John Katich?” @AnnCoulter March 15To beat Rubio, Trump had to beat: Fox, entire MSM, National Review, Salem Radio, every major GOP donor   …     MAYBE VOTERS WANT LESS IMMIGRATION! RT @tedcruz March 22Our hearts break for the men and women of Brussels this morning. @AnnCoulter reply:Civilization could use a little less heartfelt sentiment and a lot more  . GO TRUMP! @AnnCoulter March 29Like Americans everywhere, I know I’ll always remember where I was when news arrived of the tragic assault on Michelle Fields. @AnnCoulter March 31Romney lost the white vote to Obama, or barely won whites in 10 swing states. Trump only needs a few of them to win. @AnnCoulter March 31Trump’s working class white vote gives him a number of paths to electoral victory. Other GOPs have no path. @AnnCoulter March 31True, I’ve gone from supporting Trump to wildly supporting Trump. Report: “Coulter appears to sour on ‘mental’ Donald Trump” @AnnCoulter April 8@DailyCaller: GOP Establishment Money Funding Mark Levin, Glenn Beck, Erick Erickson to Attack Trump, @AnnCoulter April 8In Massachusetts alone, 20k Dems switched to R to vote for Trump. I think we can lose the pundit class. @AnnCoulter April 25If new   axis fails to stop Trump, isn’t next chess move Jeb! ? Or maybe  !  .  ? @AnnCoulter April 2561, 500 Democrats have switched their registration to Republican in PA, so far in 2016. GO TRUMP! @AnnCoulter April 26This campaign is far from over. Still need to choose the theme of Trump’s inaugural ball, and which high school bands to invite. @AnnCoulter April   in Earthling suit discusses basketball: Cruz calls hoop a ‘basketball ring’ (Cruz announces Carly Fiorina as his VP) @AnnCoulter April 27Guess we best stay glued to the TV today, in case Cruz decides to give his inaugural address or appoint a new Secretary of the Interior. @AnnCoulter April 28DRUDGE: TRUMP MOST VOTES IN REPUBLICAN HISTORY! It’s beginning to look like the wall is more popular than “Hispanic outreach. ” @AnnCoulter April 29What I like most about immigrants is their gratitude. “TRUMP SUPPORTERS BEATEN, BLOODIED BY ‘  WAVERS’” @AnnCoulter May 3Jake Tapper just claimed Trump has offended every single group “from Muslims to Hispanics. ” One group he hasn’t offended: AMERICANS. (House Speaker Paul Ryan Refuses to endorse Trump) @AnnCoulter May 12So far, Trump has received 10, 994, 897 votes  counting. Monumentally irrelevant whether or not Ryan chooses to make it 10, 994, 898. @AnnCoulter May 27GUARANTEE: Next Memorial Day weekend won’t find President Trump in an Axis country, groveling. @AnnCoulter Aug. 21NYT   tally since Trump clinched nomination: 102   0   22   7  . (Trump Phoenix immigration speech) @AnnCoulter Aug. 31After Trump’s triumphant visit with the Mexican president today, he should skip this speech  start putting together his transition team. @AnnCoulter Aug. 31Wow. This doesn’t sound like “softening. ” GO, TRUMP! !! @AnnCoulter Aug. 31Trump: “Our greatest compassion must be for our American citizens. ” @AnnCoulter Aug. 31I hear Churchill had a nice turn of phrase, but Trump’s immigration speech is the most magnificent speech ever given. @AnnCoulter Sept. 18Trump has really stepped in it this time: He called NYC explosion a “bomb” 24 hours before it was confirmed to be a bomb. DISQUALIFYING! @AnnCoulter Oct. 4I tuned in an hour late. Has Tim Kaine interrupted Pence’s every syllable with, “Will Donald Trump release his taxes? ”! @AnnCoulter Oct. 12ABC lies: “Trump boasts of grabbing women without their consent. ” What he actually said: “They let you do it. ” That’s not assault, morons. @AnnCoulter Oct. 19Finally a debate topic that has any effect on Americans’ lives. Heroin problem is 100% a result of our open border. THANK YOU, MR. TRUMP! !! @AnnCoulter Oct. 19Trump doesn’t need to cut entitlements  —   he’s going to stop dumping 3d world immigrants on the country sucking up those entitlements. @AnnCoulter Nov. 6Brett Baier show on Coyote News is reporting  —   as fact  —   that Trump “insulted” Khizr Khan’s wife. CAN SOME MEDIA OUTLET QUOTE THIS “INSULT”? @AnnCoulter Nov. 8Is it too late to impeach him? @NYMag: George W. Bush and Laura Bush Did Not Vote for Trump, @AnnCoulter Nov. 9Proposed Trump victory speech: “I still say he was born in Kenya.

Next time, we must be allowed to vote for Trump twice. @AnnCoulter Dec. 19Bill Clinton says Trump knows how to get angry white men to vote for him. What angry white men? They’re all happy now.
