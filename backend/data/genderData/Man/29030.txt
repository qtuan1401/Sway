GOP frontrunner Donald Trump distributed only $2. 4 million of the reported $6 million he raised for disabled veterans, according to The Wall Street Journal (WSJ). [WSJ notes that 19 of the 22 organizations that Trump’s campaign listed as potential recipients of the funds have received $2. 4 million dollars.  “Of the three other charities, one declined to disclose how much it had received, another said it needed to submit more paperwork before receiving any money, and the third didn’t respond to questions by the Journal,” Fox News reports. Instead of attending Fox News’s debate in Iowa prior to the Iowa caucus, Trump held a fundraiser for disabled veterans where he claimed to have raised $6 million dollars. Trump’s spokesperson Hope Hicks said Trump has “given to the 22 groups we originally announced and many others. ” “Additionally, we are continuing to distribute the money raised as it comes in and we are expanding the list of groups receiving contributions,” Hicks stated. “If the media spent half as much time highlighting the work of these groups and how our Veterans have been so mistreated, rather than trying to disparage Mr. Trump’s generosity for a totally unsolicited gesture for which he had no obligation, we would all be better for it. He has raised millions of dollars for the Vets, and rather than being thanked, he is attacked. As Mr. Trump said, ‘No good deed goes unpunished. ’”
