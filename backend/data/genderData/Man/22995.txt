On Saturday, GOP presidential   Donald Trump gave his victory speech after coming out on top in the South Carolina primary.  Trump took the podium to “USA!” chants. He joked there was a hospital ready in case his daughter, Ivanka Trump, goes into labor. The GOP   took a shot at South Carolina Gov. Nikki Haley. “We have a wonderful lieutenant governor who backed us really early in the process. You know Henry, right? The lieutenant governor of South Carolina. I will take him over the governor anytime, because we won,” he said. After letting his daughter and wife speak, Trump said, “We’re gonna do the wall, and by the way, who’s gonna pay for the wall?” The crowd responded in unison, “Mexico!” He added that Hispanics love him and he loves them. Trump then promised to end Obamacare, as well as common core math. He also addressed the police and the military, saying he loves them both. “We love our military. And by the way, we love our police. Our police are terrific. We love our police. They are not being treated properly. We’re going to build our military so big, so good, so strong, so powerful, that nobody is ever going to mess with us, folks,” he said. Towards the end of his speech, Trump noted the amount of people attending his events, joking only the walls could stop his crowds. The crowd then chanted “USA!” again. He concluded, “Let’s put this thing away and let’s make America great again!” Follow Trent Baker on Twitter @MagnifiTrent
