Sunday on NBC’s “Meet the Press,” moderator Chuck Todd pressed Republican presidential   on an incident involving a protester at his Fayetteville, NC rally and    John McGraw, who punched that protester as he was being escorted out of the Crown Coliseum.  Trump insisted he didn’t condone violence at his rallies, but said he wanted to see more about that particular incident. “I want to see,” Trump said. “The man got carried away, he was 78 years old, he obviously loves his country, and maybe he doesn’t like seeing what’s happening to the country. ” Todd went on to ask him to if he an earlier statement pertained to this situation in which he said he would pay for the legal fees of punching anyone threatening to throw tomatoes at him at an earlier rally. Trump did not rule the possibility out of paying McGraw’s legal fees. “Well, I’m going to look at it,” he replied. “I’m going to see, you know, what was behind this because it was a strange event. ” “I’ve actually instructed my people to look into it, yes,” he added.
