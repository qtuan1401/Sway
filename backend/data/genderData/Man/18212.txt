Trump’s speech:  Effective enough.  1) Reagan’s famous   “The Speech” was all facts like Trump’s opening. Can be very effective. 2) Smart decision to implicitly praise Obama (for putatively regretting appointing Hillary!) 3) “Americanism not Globalism”  —   This section kind of skimpy. Trump seems to have chosen the more conventional    template. Not so interesting, but he’s not trying for tenure. 4) “Things will never change” vs. “things have to change. ” Auspicious   theme! “The Democrats have explained the economy in various ways.   …    ” 5) Hillary’s “Terrible, terrible crimes”  —   a bit overstated, no? Terrible judgment, yes. 6) Not sure I like the “I’m the strong man who can defend you powerless people” posture. In a democracy, people aren’t powerless. Why not say that? 7)  “Abandon policy of   …     regime change. ” Can’t say it’s substanceless. 8) “Decades of record immigration have produced lower wages and higher unemployment for our citizens, especially for   and Latino workers. ” OK, I’m happy. But he quickly goes back to talking about violence. Would prefer mockery of   economic Polyannaism, like that of   …     Paul Ryan. 9) “Not alone any longer. ” OK, that resonates. 10) Any sellout on The Wall just got a bit harder, 11) Visa overstay issue is important to Latino voters  —   i. e. it’s not just the people (mainly Latinos) sneaking across the Mexican border who can bid down wages and take U. S. jobs. 12)  “Americans want relief from uncontrolled immigration.   …     Hillary Clinton is proposing mass amnesty, mass immigration, and mass lawlessness. Her plan will overwhelm your schools and hospitals,”  !  13) OK, the Steve Miller section’s over. Time to wrap it up.   …     14) The promise to appoint “a person of similar views” to Scalia seems way more significant than Trump’s previous list of judges (a list that could be added to later)   15: “I will fight for you. ” Bob Shrum wins again.
