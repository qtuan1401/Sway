[Gingrich confronted Kelly for her “bias” in constantly talking about Donald Trump’s alleged sex acts, challenging Kelly to call Bill Clinton a sexual “predator. ” Kelly did not rise to the challenge.  Lets get this straight  …    Megyn Kelly isn’t for all women  …    she hates Trump, so she’s only for those so called victims! NEVER for me!  —   PJGirlie (@ThePaulaJones) October 26, 2016,  Gingrich, who was in the running for vice president on the Trump ticket, took a decisive blow at Kelly, who was reportedly integral in knocking Roger Ailes out of Fox News in favor of increased power by Rupert Murdoch’s sons Lachlan and James.  Paula Jones is the former Arkansas state employee who famously sued Clinton for sexual harassment. Jones received a settlement of $800, 000.
