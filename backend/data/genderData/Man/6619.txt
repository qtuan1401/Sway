(Want to get this briefing by email? Here’s the  .) Good evening. Here’s the latest. 1. The focus in Orlando was on comforting the bereaved. President Obama met with families of the scores of people killed and injured in the attack on a gay club early Sunday. “Their grief is beyond description,” Mr. Obama said after he and Vice President Joe Biden met privately with mourners for two hours. _____ 2. A new analysis of federal data shows that gay, lesbian, bisexual and transgender people are the most frequent targets of hate crimes in the U. S. That was true even before the attack in Orlando. One analyst suggested that, as society becomes more tolerant of L. G. B. T. people, some opponents become more radical. _____ 3. A   Democratic filibuster led by Senator Christopher Murphy of Connecticut, above, forced the Senate majority leader, Mitch McConnell, to allow a vote on two   amendments in coming days. But our congressional correspondent writes that, given   politics, neither is likely to pass. _____ 4. British campaigning over the   Brexit vote next week was halted after a rising member of Parliament was killed in her district of northern England. Jo Cox, 41, was wrapping up a meeting with constituents at a library near Leeds when she was stabbed and shot, a rarity in a country where guns are tightly controlled. A    man was arrested, but the authorities did not immediately comment on a motive. _____ 5. Donald J. Trump’s campaign is so focused on   for the general election that his appearances are being mostly kept to southern, heavily Republican states where he is already popular. That puts him at a disadvantage in battleground states, where Hillary Clinton has been campaigning vigorously. In a sign that a small, but growing, crowd in the financial world is warming up to the idea of backing Mr. Trump, a who’s who of financiers will host a   for the candidate on Tuesday at an undisclosed location in New York City. _____ 6. Senator Bernie Sanders spoke to his supporters via videoconference. He didn’t drop out of the race or endorse Mrs. Clinton, choosing instead to deliver a shortened version of his stump speech. Mr. Sanders pledged to make certain that Mr. Trump is defeated but added that defeating him cannot be the only goal. _____ 7. It was a busy day in sports. The the United States men’s national soccer team, above, beat Ecuador,   advancing to the semifinals of Copa América. LeBron James scored 41 points, leading the Cleveland Cavaliers in a rout of the Golden State Warriors,   and sending the N. B. A. finals to a decisive Game 7. And rain halted play at the U. S. Open as Jordan Spieth began defending his title. This year, the golf tournament is at Oakmont, in Pennsylvania, one of the toughest courses in North America. _____ 8. Microsoft became the first major U. S. corporation to plan a role in the burgeoning marijuana industry, announcing a project to create   software. The announcement of the new   offering came just days after Microsoft signaled its intent to diversify with a $26. 2 billion deal to buy LinkedIn. _____ 9.   Miranda, the creator and star of “Hamilton,” confirmed that he would leave the Broadway blockbuster on July 9 (and get a haircut). Among his more immediate projects: working on a Disney film and preparing for a   sequel to “Mary Poppins,” with Emily Blunt. He said he would rejoin “Hamilton” or its touring arms from time to time. “This is a role I am going to be going back to again and again,” he said. _____ 10. Gone from Lake Wobegon: Garrison Keillor hosts his final official “Prairie Home Companion” on July 1. One of our   stories today looks at how he flourished on the radio show for four decades, known for a garrulous persona that is, in fact, a far cry from his introverted own. “His gaze is often floating and takes you in from a strange distance,” the writer Roger Angell said. “He is certainly the strangest person I know. ” Above, Mr. Keillor in the 1970s. _____ 11. Investigators recovered the cockpit voice recorder from EgyptAir Flight 804 after locating wreckage on the Mediterranean floor. The recorder was in “a damaged state,” an official said, but may still be able to provide valuable clues as to why the Airbus 320 veered off course a month ago and plunged into the sea, killing all 66 aboard. Above, a diving robot at work. _____ 12. Finally, Orlando got an infusion of unconditional love from specially trained experts. Lutheran Church Charities sent 12 golden retrievers from its   Comfort Dogs team to make the rounds of hospitals, churches and vigils. “We’ve had a lot of people here that start petting the dog, and they break out crying,” a charity official said. _____ Your Evening Briefing is posted at 6 p. m.
