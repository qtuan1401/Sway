On this weekend’s broadcast of “Fox News Sunday,” Republican presidential nominee Donald Trump campaign manager Kellyanne Conway pledged the campaign will be doing minority outreach events in inner cities.  Conway said, “I pledge to you and everybody who is watching, Those events are actually being planned. And we are very excited about them. Look, John McCain and mitt Romney are fine  —   they’re wonderful human beings, great Americans. they were fine presidential nominees. John McCain got 4 percent of the   vote, and Mitt Romney improved that to a whopping 6 percent. We’re fighting for every single vote. We’re going to leave it all on the field. that includes going where the voters are and taking the case directly to them. ” (  WFB) Follow Pam Key on Twitter @pamkeyNEN
