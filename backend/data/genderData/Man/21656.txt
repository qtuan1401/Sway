On this weekend’s broadcast of “Fox News Sunday,” Washington Post columnist George Will explained why he left the Republican Party over presumptive Republican presidential nominee Donald Trump.  Will said, “I left it for the same reason I joined it in 1964 when I voted for Barry Goldwater, because I was a conservative. I leave for the same reason, I’m a conservative. To give you a time line, shortly after Trump became the presumptive nominee he had a summit meeting with Paul Ryan where they stressed their vast shared ground, which is more important than their differences. I thought that was puzzling because Paul Ryan still didn’t endorse him. After Trump went after the Mexican judge, then Paul Ryan endorsed him. I decided that, in fact, this is not my party anymore. I changed my registration to unaffiliated 23 days ago. I hardly made an announcement. I mentioned this in a meeting with the Federalist Society. The long and the short of it is, as Ronald Reagan said when he changed his registration, I did not leave the Democratic Party, the Democratic Party left me. ” Responding to Trump’s tweet about his party departure Will added, “He has an advantage on me. He can say everything he knows about any subject in 140 characters and I can’t. ” George Will, one of the most overrated political pundits (who lost his way long ago) has left the Republican Party. He’s made many bad calls,  —   Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) June 26, 2016,  Follow Pam Key on Twitter @pamkeyNEN
