Vice President Joe Biden accused Donald Trump of lying for saying he cared about working people, calling it a “bunch of malarkey” and thrilling the audience at the Democratic National Convention in Philadelphia by using the same slogan he employed against Republican vice presidential nominee Paul Ryan in 2012.  “He’s trying to tell us he cares about the middle class?” Biden asked. “Give me a break! That’s a bunch of malarkey!” Biden reminded the crowd of his middle class roots growing up in Scranton, Pennsylvania and said that Trump didn’t understand them. He also questioned Trump’s love of the phrase “You’re fired!” asserting that he had no empathy for ordinary Americans. “He has no clue about what makes America great,” Biden roared. “Actually, he has no clue, period. ” The crowd repeatedly shouted “not a clue” as they held red signs that read “Joe. ” Biden was spoiling for a fight, as he jogged on stage to the Rocky theme music, but his eyes glistened with tears as he delivered one of his last remaining significant speeches in office. The Vice President, who has been criticized by a member of Obama’s own administration for being “wrong on nearly every major foreign policy and national security issue over the past four decades,” asserted that Trump was unfit to lead the country as commander in chief. “No major party nominee in the history of this nation has ever known less or has been less prepared to deal with our national security,” he said.
