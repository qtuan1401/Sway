George Will, television pundit and columnist at The Washington Post, said he has left the Republican Party, and he spelled out the   Clinton strategy he thinks will allow the establishment Republicans to regain control of the party after this presidential election. [“This is not my party,” Will said at a fancy luncheon at the Federalist Society in Washington, D. C. where he took the party line in the nation’s capital and said that Trump would be worse than Clinton.  “Make sure he loses. Grit their teeth for four years and win the White House” in 2020, Will said, referring to what Republicans should do about Trump. The bespectacled baseball aficionado has mostly been a   this election cycle, as Trump’s populist nationalist campaign has galvanized voters and taken over Will’s   party. Trump has failed to lock up the support of some Beltway and establishment conservative types, despite the fact that he is running on an extremely   platform based on    tax cuts, immigration control, and a tough stance on terrorism. Will, who has been known to talk about baseball, and frequently compares politics to the sport, appears to now be a Democratic   free agent. It is unclear whether he will —  or should —  return to the Republican Party at any point in the future.
