In recent interviews with The New York Times, Mr. Trump sketched out what he meant to be a reassuring vision of his early presidency, including rapid action on a wall with Mexico and halting Muslim immigration. _____ 2. Bernie Sanders holds a lead on Mr. Trump even wider than Hillary Clinton’s, according to a new national poll.
