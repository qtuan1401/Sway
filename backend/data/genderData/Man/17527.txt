Donald Trump sent out two messages on his Twitter account Tuesday defending campaign manager Corey Lewandowski, which led Michelle Fields to post her own retort. [Trump suggested the criminal charges filed Tuesday morning against Lewandowski for allegedly assaulting Fields would not lead to a conviction  —   stating that CCTV footage of the altercation showed “nothing. ”  He then implied Fields told a different story “before she found out that episode was on tape. ” Fields responded to this tweet, insisting her story had not changed and that the presidential candidate should “stop lying. ” Wow, Corey Lewandowski, my campaign manager and a very decent man, was just charged with assaulting a reporter. Look at   there!  —   Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) March 29, 2016,  Why aren’t people looking at this reporters earliest statement as to what happened, that is before she found out the episode was on tape?  —   Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) March 29, 2016,  Because my story never changed. Seriously, just stop lying.  https:  .   —   Michelle Fields (@MichelleFields) March 29, 2016,
