 (CNN)  Donald Trump will stay at the presidential guest house Blair House in the nights before the inauguration, according to transition spokesman Jason Miller. Earlier Saturday, two sources with knowledge of the planning confirmed to CNN what The New York Times first reported: that Trump was considering staying at the Trump International Hotel in downtown Washington. In his reaction to the story, Miller on Saturday evening tweeted: ”Not accurate. The   is staying at Blair House.” If Trump had decided to stay at his hotel, it would have broken with modern tradition, since many recent incoming presidents have stayed at Blair House, which is across the street from the White House. Asked earlier about Trump’s plans, the inaugural committee’s director of communications, Boris Epshteyn told CNN: ”We are planning a uniting and exciting inaugural, a true celebration of freedom and democracy. We will be releasing additional details at the appropriate time.”
