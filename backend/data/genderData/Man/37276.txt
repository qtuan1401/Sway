 (CNN) Hillary Clinton holds a   edge over Donald Trump, according to a new national poll released Thursday.  The latest findings from Quinnipiac University found Clinton claiming the support of 45% of likely voters, with Trump garnering 38%. Ten percent of likely voters back Libertarian candidate Gary Johnson, according to the Quinnipiac poll, while Green Party candidate Jill Stein has the support of 4% of voters.  It continues what has been a strong month of polling for the former secretary of state, as Trump continues to look for a spark following his latest campaign shakeup.  Johnson is hoping to become the first   candidate since Ross Perot in 1992 to qualify for the presidential debates. In order to join Clinton and Trump on stage this fall, Johnson will need to average 15% in five national polls chosen by the Commission on Presidential Debates.  Clinton’s lead over Trump swells without the   candidates included, Quinnipiac found. In a    with the Republican nominee, Clinton garners 51% and leads by 10.  The Quinnipiac poll was conducted by phone, cellular and landline, August   among a sample of 1, 498 likely voters. It has a margin of error of 2. 5 percentage points.
