Thursday on MSNBC, while discussing Speaker of the House Rep. Paul Ryan’s ( ) meeting with presumptive Republican presidential nominee Donald Trump, Bill Kristol, editor of The Weekly Standard, told members of the Republican Party that reunifying the party would mean “capitulation. ”  Kristol said, “It is so depressing as a Republican and a conservative to be seeing Donald Trump making this triumphal procession  —   pretty triumphal I think honestly  —   through Washington with Republican leadership, of the Republican National Committee, and the Republicans and the House and the Senate basically capitulating to him. Unification means capitulation here. Paul Ryan hasn’t endorsed him yet but he has certainly laid the predicate for endorsement. Others are rushing to get aboard the train. As Chris Matthews said, they now think he might win. They want to be a part of the winning team. They’ve totally forgotten all the objections they made to Trump’s fundamental character and judgment. ” Follow Pam Key on Twitter @pamkeyNEN
