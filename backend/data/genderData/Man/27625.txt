Tuesday on the campaign trail, Republican presidential hopeful Sen. Ted Cruz ( ) reacted to the news that Corey Lewandowski, the campaign manager for his opponent Republican presidential   Donald Trump, was charged with misdemeanor battery for allegations of grabbing former reporter Breitbart News Michelle Fields at a Jupiter, FL campaign event on March 6.  Cruz declared that it was a “consequence” of the “abusive culture” of Trump’s campaign. Cruz said, “It’s a very sad development. This is the consequence of the culture of the Trump campaign. The abusive culture. When you have campaign that is built on personal insults, on attacks, and now, physical violence, that has no place in a political campaign, and it has no place in our democracy. ” Follow Pam Key on Twitter @pamkeyNEN
