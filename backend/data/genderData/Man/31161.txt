During a June 13 speech, presumptive Republican presidential candidate Donald Trump said he will be “meeting with the NRA” to discuss how Americans can best defend themselves in the wake of the Orlando terror attack. [He said this after stressing the dangerous situation Americans now face here at home, as illustrated by the bloody and “savage” attack on Pulse Orlando which left approximately 50 dead and 53 wounded.  Trump talked about Hillary Clinton’s response to Orlando —  a response which avoids the phrase radical Islamic terror, includes stepping up outreach to Muslims, and places more gun control on the backs of   Americans. He said, “She wants to take away Americans’ guns and then admit the very people who want to slaughter us. ” He countered: I will be meeting with the NRA —  which has given me their earliest endorsement in a presidential race —  to discuss how to insure Americans have the means to protect themselves in this age of terror. I will be always defending the Second Amendment. The NRA endorsed Trump for president on May 20. In so doing, the NRA’s Wayne LaPierre stressed the need to stand strong to preserve a future for our children. He said, “We will elect our next president, we will save our freedom, and America will be great again. ” AWR Hawkins is the Second Amendment columnist for Breitbart News and political analyst for Armed American Radio.
