’  ’ ”   Thanks to MSNBC’s Rachel Maddow and investigative reporter David   Cay Johnston of DCReport. org, America got to see two more pages   of President Donald Trump’s tax returns. ” ”   And while the pages don’t tell us much about where his money   comes from, what we do know from looking at them is that  —   in   2005 at least  —   Trump wasn’t making money like the billionaire   people thought he was. ” ”   In 2005, Forbes put Trump’s  and Trump was trying to convince   people he was worth a lot more. That year, a journalist  —   Tim   O’Brien  —   reported that Trump’s wealth was probably less than   $250 million. ” ”   The claim got O’Brien sued by Trump, but the suit was dismissed,   and O’Brien  —   then a reporter for The New York Times and now a   boss at Bloomberg News  —   has spent the past year or so beating   Trump up over his claims of fabulous wealth. ” ”   The tax return doesn’t entirely settle the matter because we got   to see only two pages of the document, but we did learn some   things about where Trump’s earnings came from that year.  ” ’’ ’   The return shows he earned about $110 million from his   investments. That included a   $32 million gain that came   from selling off assets, while the rest came from income earned   from rental real estate and ownership of businesses, and in the   form of interest. ’ ’   The second chunk  —   about $78 million  —   basically suggests   what he’’s earnings from all his assets. On $2. 6 billion, it is a   return of just 3%. That’’s not great, but it’’s not all Trump   earned that year. Trump disclosed another $42 million of   ”business income,” but we don’’t know what this is or if some of   it was from his role as a star and owner of ”.” ’ ”   Now, anyone can have a lousy year as an investor. But remember   that we’re talking about 2005. The        bubble was still inflating, stocks were rising, and   interest rates were high. You could get 4% just from     Treasury bonds back then, meaning you’d be netting $40 million   just by parking $1 billion in the safest investment out there. ” ”   Then there’s the matter of the $103 million loss. When it came to   paying taxes, all that income was whittled down by this huge   loss, leaving him with adjusted gross income of $48. 5 million.   Where the loss comes from also isn’t clear, but some tax experts   told CBS News that it could be lingering from the huge     Trump took in a 1995 tax filing that was released by The New York   Times during the campaign. ” ’   About $32 million of that is the   sale of assets taxed at   a lower rate, which leaves another $16 million to be taxed at a   regular rate. So that means that with all the losses folded in,   Trump is claiming he earned $16 million in 2005. ’ ’   The reason his tax bill is much higher than that of someone who   earned just $16 million is the alternative minimum tax. This is a   tax on people or entities that take a lot of deductions. In fact,   the way the law was  sounds as though it had a businessman   like Trump in mind: ’ ’   This is the government’’s way of saying, ”We know you lost money   doing business, but you still have to pay on whatever it is you   made.” Without the AMT kicking in, Trump would have paid taxes of   only about $5 million. ’ ”   That’s not billionaire money. ” ”Thanks to MSNBC’s Rachel Maddow and. ..” ’’ ’’ ’’
