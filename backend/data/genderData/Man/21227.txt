Saturday on her Fox News Channel show “Justice,” host Judge Jeanine Pirro lit into Democratic presidential nominee Hillary Clinton for calling Republican nominee Donald Trump supporters “deplorable,” which she later apologized for.  “Hillary, you bow to and take money from countries who throw gays off buildings. You take money for your   charity from countries that don’t allow women to drive, a   feminist who supports countries that force women to cover every part of their bodies but their eyeballs, and you want to call us Islamophobes?” Pirro said. Pirro then followed Clinton’s lead and did some name calling of her own, using insults like “liar,” “dishonest” and “condescending. ” “Hillary, since you started the name calling, Hillary, you are a liar, and a pathological one at that. You’re a cheat. You’re dishonest. You are condescending. You are arrogant, contemptuous, and if you think that your   apology will wipe the slate clean, you are wrong. It takes you 17 hours to figure out that you had to apologize? The ordinary people, Hillary, the people who have to follow the law, who have no choice but to pay their taxes, who have to work two and three jobs, who fight for all of us, many of whom come back with fewer limbs, don’t want a president who hates us. we don’t want a president who thinks that we’re deplorable. ” Follow Trent Baker on Twitter @MagnifiTrent
