’  ’ ’   WASHINGTON (Reuters)   The heads of the Pentagon and the U. S.   intelligence community have recommended to President Barack Obama   that the director of the National Security Agency, Admiral   Michael Rogers, be removed from his position, sources familiar   with the matter said on Saturday. ’ ’   The recommendation by Defense Secretary Ash Carter and Director   of National Intelligence James Clapper, first reported by The   Washington Post, was delivered to the White House last   month.    ’ ’   Obama chose Rogers to take over at the NSA in 2014 and tasked him   with repairing the damage after the huge leaks about its   electronic spying program by contractor Edward Snowden. ’ ’   But there have been other security lapses, the sources said,   including the one that led to the arrest of NSA contractor Harold   Martin earlier this year.     ’ ’   Rogers is being considered as a potential new director of   national intelligence by   Donald Trump, a post   that oversees all 17 U. S. intelligence agencies. ’ ’’ ’   The Washington Post reported that a decision by Rogers to travel   to New York to meet with Trump on Thursday without notifying   superiors caused consternation at senior levels of the   administration, but the recommendation to remove him predated his   visit. ’ ’   The White House, Pentagon, NSA and office of the Director of   National Intelligence declined to comment on the matter. A Trump   campaign spokesman had no immediate comment. ’ ’   The Obama administration wants to split leadership at the   National Security Agency and U. S. Cyber Command, arguing that the   job of leading two agencies with differing missions is too much   for one person. ’ ”   But some members of Congress, led by Republican Senator John   McCain, the Senate Armed Services Committee chairman, oppose that   plan, saying that Cyber Command needs access to the NSA’s   resources to do its job effectively.          ” ’   (Reporting by Phil Stewart; Additional reporting and writing by   Patricia Zengerle; Editing by Alistair Bell) ’
