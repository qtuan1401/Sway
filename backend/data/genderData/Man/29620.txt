Kid Rock has released a line of   Trump merchandise that has sent some offended social media users into a frenzy. [The   rocker’s new merchandise includes a replica of the   Trump campaign hat that reads “MAKE AMERICA BADASS AGAIN,” and a   bearing the slogan “GOD GUNS  TRUMP. ”  One   depicts an electoral map of America, with red states labeled “United States of America” and blue states labeled “Dumbf*ckistan. ” Due to overwhelming demand, we decided to go ahead and actually make this  other current event merch: https:  .  pic. twitter.   —   Kid Rock (@KidRock) December 5, 2016,  Another   shirt from the singer’s store reads “_onald Trump,” with the  : “The ‘D’ is missing because it’s in every hater’s mouth. ” A note next to the items on the official Warner Bros. merchandise store includes a disclaimer citing “overwhelming demand” as the reason why they “actually made” the shirts. Posts featuring the singer in photoshopped     had gone viral on social media before the shirts were actually manufactured. While some applauded the musician’s latest move, other weren’t as thrilled with the new merchandise. “No longer a fan of yours  …    shoulda kept your politics quiet,” one Twitter user tweeted, while another called Kid Rock a “bigot. ” @KidRock What a ”D”ick you’ve become over the past couple of years.

You embody patriotism and that’s what elect him.  —   red (@kotuzak) December 5, 2016,  Kid Rock remained silent for most of the presidential campaign, but did deliver a resounding endorsement of Trump earlier this year. “My feeling: Let the motherf*cking business guy run it like a f*cking business,” he said of Trump in an interview with Rolling Stone. “I’m digging Trump. I feel like a lot of people, whether you’re a Democrat or a Republican, feel like if you get Hillary or Bernie, or you get Rubio or Cruz or whoever, there’s going to be the same sh*t. ”   Follow Jerome Hudson on Twitter @jeromeehudson
