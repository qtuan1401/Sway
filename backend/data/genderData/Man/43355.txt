’  ’ ”   Mike Pence, the vice president of the United States, has said he   doesn’t believe smoking kills people. ” ’   He made that case in  and has made no public   effort to update his position since. ’ ’   ”Time for a quick reality check,” Pence wrote. ”Despite the   hysteria from the political class and the media, smoking doesn’’t   kill. In fact, 2 out of every three smokers does not die from a   smoking related illness and 9 out of ten smokers do not contract   lung cancer.” ’ ’   Those statistics are  largely because   we keep discovering new ways that smoking is deadly. Those   statistics would still be worrisome, however. About 40 million   people smoke in the US, .   One out of every three current smokers dying from a     illness would therefore translate to about 13. 3   million people dead. One out of 10 smokers developing lung cancer   means 4 million sick people. ’ ’   Pence added the caveat ”news flash: smoking is not good for you,”   which further raises the question of why he felt the need to   write a piece in the first place downplaying tobacco’’s dangers. ’ ’’ ’   To be clear: The year 2000 was a while ago, but it also came 36   years after Surgeon General Luther Terry published . ’ ”   Pence was selected to be a stable, mainstream running mate for   Donald Trump, and to settle the nerves of the Republican Party  —     apparently . Now he’s just one of the   many reasons . ”
