Presumptive Republican nominee Donald Trump calls President Barack Obama’s appearance on the campaign trail with presumptive Democratic nominee Hillary Clinton “a carnival act. ”[“We have a person in the White House that’s having a lot of fun. I watched him today, it’s like a carnival act,” Trump stated during his campaign rally in North Carolina on Tuesday night. “He should be home working on ISIS, where the threat is getting worse and worse, he should be working on trade, he should be working on the borders. ”  Trump also mocked Obama’s concern over climate change and carbon emissions, as the president so frequently uses Air Force One. “This guy  —   he gets on this plane. Flies to Hawaii. He’s there for a long time. Golf, golf, golf, golf. More, more. Learning how to chip, learning how to hit the drive, learning how to putt,” Trump jabbed. “ISIS is laughing at us, they’re chopping off heads, they’re drowning us in steel cages, and he’s out there playing golf. ” Trump’s comments came after Obama criticized the Republican in North Carolina. “This isn’t a reality show. This is reality. And being president of the United States means you have to deal with reality. When a crisis hits, you can’t just walk off the set. You can’t fire the scriptwriter. You can’t be reckless. You don’t have the luxury of just saying what’s in your head. You’ve gotta actually do your homework,” Obama jabbed.
