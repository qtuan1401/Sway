On his Monday broadcast of “The 700 Club,” host televangelist Pat Robertson declared Republican presidential nominee Donald Trump the winner of Sunday’s debate, calling him the Phoenix because he came back when everyone thought he was dead.  Robertson said, “Let’s face it. A guy does something 11 years ago. There’s a conversation in Hollywood where he’s trying to look like he’s macho. And 11 years after that, they surface it from The Washington Post or whatever, bring it out within 30 days or so of the election, and this is supposed to be the death blow and everybody writes him off, ‘OK, he’s dead. Now you’ve got to get out of the way and let Mike Pence run the campaign,’” “The Donald says no,” he went on to say. “He’s like the Phoenix. They think he’s dead. He’s come back. And he came back strong. So, he won that debate. ” (  The Hill) Follow Breitbart. tv on Twitter @BreitbartVideo
