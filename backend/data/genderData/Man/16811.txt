My central supposition about this election is that Donald Trump will lose because most regular middle Americans just won’t vote to make that man their president. This has nothing to do with ideology. It’s just about Trump. Not everyone out there adores Hillary Clinton by a long shot, and I understand well that for a lot of people this is a choice between beef liver and lumpfish, but I just think at the end of the day most people will say, No, I just can’t —  I just can’t help make that crude, boorish, vindictive, childish man the president of the United States. I think this is what will save Clinton —  and the country —  in the end. But as soon as I think that, I think: But what if I’m wrong? What could make people change their views on Trump, become sympathetic to him? In theory, a number of things. Trump could stop being crude, boorish, vindictive, and childish. (I said “in theory. ”) Clinton could be indicted. The economy could tank. I think those are unlikely —  and yes, I saw the jobs report, but it’s early days to start talking about a recession, and it may be a silver lining of the report that it makes the Fed wait longer to raise rates, which most economists I talk to think it should do anyway. But here’s one thing that’s not a long shot —  and is in fact happening right now —  that I fear will make Trump a more sympathetic figure to the kinds of Americans I’m talking about:   protestors turning violent and throwing eggs at Trump supporters and burning hats and flags.
