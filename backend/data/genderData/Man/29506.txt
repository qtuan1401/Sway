I’m worried about the name calling that’s going on in the Middle East. I’m worried about the name calling that’s going on at homes at night because somebody can’t have a job because the economy is so rotten and all those things are what we need to be focused on in this country rather than, you know  —   listen, I get it, this is reality TV. We’re in a totally different time in our country’s history when it comes to this whole electoral process, but at the end of the day, we’ve got some really serious issues. ” When asked if he would vote for Trump against Clinton said, “I will, I will, at the end day that I will. I will. Listen, Hillary  —   Senator Clinton has a different philosophical view than I do about what government’s role is. She believes the government and Washington D.
