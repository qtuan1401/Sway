Conservative commentator Pat Buchanan discussed Sunday on New York AM 970 radio’s “The Cats Roundtable” what a Hillary Clinton presidency with a Republican Congress would look like.  According to Buchanan, the country would be divided if Clinton gets elected president. He told host John Catsimatidis,“If Hillary wins, she’s going to move to the left. But the country will not be united because the Republicans will really go into the stall  —   the defense. ” If Trump is elected, Buchanan believes Republicans would be able to work together. “There’s no reason why the Republicans can’t get together if Trump wins. There is a common agenda there,” Buchanan said. “The problem I see is the personal differences, and a lot of them dating back to some pretty rough primaries. ” Follow Trent Baker on Twitter @MagnifiTrent
