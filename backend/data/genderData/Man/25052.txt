Friday at the Conservative Political Action Conference in National Harbor, MD, Republican presidential candidate Sen. Ted Cruz ( ) joked about his opponent Donald Trump canceling his scheduled appearance at the national conservative gathering.  Cruz said, “So Donald Trump is skipping CPAC. I think someone told him Megyn Kelly was going to be here. Or even worse, he was told there were conservatives that were going to be here. Or even worse, he was told libertarians were going to be here. Or even worse, he was told young people were going to be here. Now none of you all have a degree from Trump University?” He added, “The men and women here love liberty. And let me tell you as dire as things are, people are waking up all over this country, and help is on its way. ” Follow Pam Key on Twitter @pamkeyNEN
