New York Attorney General Eric Schneiderman’s office announced Monday that it issued a notice to Donald Trump’s charitable foundation that it must stop soliciting donations due to not having the proper certification in accordance with state law. [The head of the attorney general’s charities bureau James Sheehan said if the Trump Foundation doesn’t file the proper paperwork and stop fundraising, it would be committing “a continuing fraud upon the people of New York. ”  Trump’s foundation was ordered to hand over the required legal paperwork for charities within 15 days, according to the Washington Post. Trump’s spokesperson Hope Hicks reacted to the order on Monday, saying, “While we remain very concerned about the political motives behind A. G. Schneiderman’s investigation, the Trump Foundation nevertheless intends to cooperate fully with the investigation. ” Hicks added,“Because this is an ongoing legal matter, the Trump Foundation will not comment further at this time. ”
