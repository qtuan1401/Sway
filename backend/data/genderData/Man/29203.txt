Trump became   Mexico’s Foreign Relations Minister Claudia Ruiz Massieu said her country was willing to “modernize” the North American Free Trade Agreement, AFP reported.  Trump has claimed NAFTA has taken American jobs and has been one of the worst deals signed by the United States.  Ruiz Massieu said the government of that country would be meeting with the Trump administration in the coming months in order to discuss NAFTA. The Mexican politician said they were open to modernizing the agreement in order to make it more beneficial for Mexico, the U. S. and Canada.
