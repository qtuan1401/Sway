Andrews and Burley suggested that Trump had a problem with “hurtful” statements about women and minorities but Yiannopoulos pointed out that Trump is polling strongly with blacks, Hispanics and women.  “Is he a misogynistic racist?” asked Burley. “Of course not,” responded Yiannopoulos, who went on to say: “You can’t stump the Trump. He’ll make America fabulous again. ” Follow Milo Yiannopoulos (@Nero) on Twitter and Facebook, or write to him at milo@breitbart. com.
