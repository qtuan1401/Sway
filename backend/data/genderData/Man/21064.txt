Friday on “CBS This Morning,” host of the network’s “Face the Nation” John Dickerson said at this point in the Republican presidential primary “it seems awfully hard” to see how   Donald Trump would be stopped form winning the nomination.  Dickerson said, “It seems awfully hard to see how he would get stopped. Even if he doesn’t get to 1, 237 that would give him a majority. Every one of these big wins is a chance for him to come out and make a claim for fairness. He’s turned into the fairness candidate who is saying if I go to the convention and have the delegates and votes, I should get the nomination regardless of this threshold. That’s a huge moment for him to make that argument in the debate, he’s been in with the Republican party. Every one of these victories he gets, he’s building momentum toward that number he needs to get but also building points in an argument. ” Follow Pam Key on Twitter @pamkeyNEN
