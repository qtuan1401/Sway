’  ’ ’   Sen. Claire McCaskill of Missouri on Friday brought the Senate   closer to a ”nuclear” fight over President Donald Trump’’s   nomination of Judge Neil Gorsuch to the Supreme Court. ’ ’ McCaskill,   a moderate Democrat, said she would vote no on a procedural vote   for Gorsuch, indicating that she would join a Democratic   filibuster against the 10th Circuit Court of Appeals judge. ’ ’   ”This is a really difficult decision for me,” McCaskill wrote. ”I   am not comfortable with either choice.” ’ ’   ”While I have come to the conclusion that I can’t support Neil   Gorsuch for the Supreme Court  —   and will vote no on the   procedural vote and his confirmation  —   I remain very worried   about our polarized politics and what the future will bring,   since I’m certain we will have a Senate rule change that will   usher in more extreme judges in the future,” she continued. ’ ”   McCaskill’s announcement  of North Dakota and Joe Manchin of   West Virginia announced they would support Gorsuch’s nomination   and vote in favor of the judge.  ” ’’ ’   That brought the total number of votes to confirm Gorsuch to 54.
