Sunday on CNN’s “Reliable Sources,” journalist Carl Bernstein, known for his reporting on the Watergate scandal, said   Donald Trump “lives and thrives in a   environment.  “No president, including Richard Nixon, has been so ignorant of fact and disdains fact in the way that this   does,” Bernstein said. He continued, “It has something to do with the growing sense of authoritarianism he and his presidency are projecting. the danger of it is obvious. And he’s trying to make the conduct of the press the issue, not his own conduct. ” He added, “I would just take his bullying approach to the union leader instead of going into the facts of what the Carrier deal was and what the unions in that institution have done. Everything that he controverts he doesn’t go to a   argument. He goes to an emotional argument. What we have seen throughout the campaign is pathological disdain for the truth. A kind of lie and easy with lying that we have not seen before. ” Follow Pam Key on Twitter @pamkeyNEN
