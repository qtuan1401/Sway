On this weekend’s broadcast of  “Fox News Sunday,” host Chris Wallace asked Republican presidential candidate Donald Trump if he was “in the process of blowing” his campaign.  Trump said, “I don’t think so. I just got great polls from NBC nationwide. I think that we’re doing very well. Don’t forget, you have been thinking about that or asking me that question numerous times over the last  —   since June 16th. That statement was made many times. Did he blow his campaign, only to have higher poll numbers?” He added, “All I can do is do what I do. I’m   my campaign. I’m not a politician that is being controlled by the people that give them money. Believe necessity, they’re totally controlled. I think I’m doing very well. Was this my best week? I guess not. I could have done without the Retweet, et cetera, et cetera. ” Follow Pam Key on Twitter @pamkeyNEN
