MILO has released a video warning to America, encouraging people to vote for Donald Trump so the country avoids making “Europe’s mistake. ”[The video features audio from Milo’s speech in June at Pulse Nightclub in Orlando, Florida, after nearly fifty people were shot and killed by a Muslim at the venue, along with a video of a rainbow flag being set on fire by a lighter decorated with Hillary Clinton’s campaign logo.   “America, don’t let this happen to you” concludes Milo at the end of the video. “Before it’s too late, vote for Donald Trump. ” Charlie Nash is a reporter for Breitbart Tech.
