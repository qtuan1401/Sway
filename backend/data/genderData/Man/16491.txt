Hillary Clinton campaign surrogate Ed Rendell said that Donald Trump will be hurt by the fact that there are more “ugly” women in America than “attractive women. ”[Rendell, the former Pennsylvania governor, told the Washington Post that Trump’s comments on the fairer sex will hurt him among ugly women.  “Will he have some appeal to   Dems in Levittown or Bristol? Sure,” Rendell said. “For every one he’ll lose 1½  two Republican women. Trump’s comments like ‘You can’t be a 10 if you’re ’ that’ll come back to haunt him. There are probably more ugly women in America than attractive women. People take that stuff personally. ” Trump owned the Miss USA and Miss Universe beauty pageants from 1996 to 2015.
