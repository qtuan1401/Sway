Sen. Tom Cotton won’t rule out or “rule in” the possibility of joining presumptive Republican nominee Donald Trump’s general election ticket as a candidate for Vice President, he reveals in a new interview. [From U. S. News  World Report:  Would you accept an offer to be Trump’s running mate? (Laughs) I haven’t seen it floated out there. Like I said I’ve been focusing my political work on making sure that we hold the Senate and focus the rest of the time on my son. So that’s not ruling it out? I wouldn’t rule it in either. So you’ll be voting for Donald Trump in November? I’ve said all along, I’ll support the nominee, because we can’t afford another term of the   foreign policy or for that matter, economic policy at home. And now Donald Trump’s the presumptive nominee. So we obviously need to do some work to unify around our common and shared principles and Donald’s got the responsibility and opportunity to do that in the coming weeks.     …     And those that are out there saying there should be a   movement for conservatives. You would say what to them? I think it’s important that the Republican Party remain the home of conservatives and that the best way to advance conservative principles is to elect Republicans, up and down the ballot.
