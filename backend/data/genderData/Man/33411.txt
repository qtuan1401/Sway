 (CNN) President Donald Trump’s job approval rating has dropped to 37% while 58% of Americans disapprove of his performance so far as president, new Gallup figures show. The approval ratings, Trump’s worst since taking office two months ago, come as FBI Director James Comey is expected to tell lawmakers that there is no evidence for the President’s unverified claim that former President Barack Obama wiretapped Trump Tower during the election. Trump’s approval rating hovered in the    40s in the weeks following the beginning of his presidency. Aside from the controversy over Trump’s wiretapping claim, the latest poll numbers suggest growing dissatisfaction with his performance following the chaotic rollout of Republicans’ plan to replace the Affordable Care Act and reaction to his travel ban that has faced stiff legal opposition. Gallup tracks daily the percentage of Americans who approve or disapprove of Trump’s job performance. The daily results are based on telephone interviews with about 1, 500 national adults and have a margin of error of 3 percentage points.
