The Trump campaign is running a national television ad going after Hillary Clinton and the alleged    scheme with the Clinton Foundation. [“The Clintons: from dead broke to worth hundreds of millions  …    So how did Hillary end up filthy rich?” the ad’s voice over says.  It continues: Pay to play politics. Staggering amounts of cash poured into the Clinton Foundation from criminals, dictators, countries that hate America. Hillary cut deals for donors. Sold out American workers, exploited Haitians in need, She even gave American uranium rights to the Russians. Hillary Clinton only cares about power, money and herself. The   ad titled, “Corruption,” will be heavily aired in battle ground states. “Hillary Clinton knows nothing about creating jobs, but knows a lot about how to make money by abusing her and her husband’s government positions. The Clintons have made a living out of selling government access to Wall Street donors and special interests in exchange for donations to their slush fund conspicuously disguised as the Clinton Foundation,” Trump’s senior communications advisor Jason Miller stated. “Hillary Clinton might be the single most corrupt candidate to ever seek the Presidency and should be disqualified for her inability to tell truths to the American people. ”
