’  ’ ’   Sean Spicer, White House press secretary for President Donald   Trump, told reporters on Thursday that the administration is   considering a 20% border tax on Mexican imports. ’ ’   ”When you look at the plan that’s taking shape now, using   comprehensive tax reform as a means to tax imports from countries   that we have a trade deficit from, like Mexico,” Spicer said,   according to a White House pool report. ’ ’   Spicer said the border tax would be part of a broader tax   reform package and would help pay for the proposed wall along the     border, according to the report. ’ ’   ”It clearly provides the funding and does so in a way that the   American taxpayer is wholly respected,” Spicer said. ’ ’   ’ ’’ ’  ’ ’  ’ ’   The announcement comes the same day that Mexican president   Enrique Pena Nieto  ’ ’   Trump has long said that Mexico will pay to build the wall, which    will cost between $12 billion   to $15 billion. Nieto has said Mexico will not pay for the wall. ’ ’   Spicer said that the administration has been in contact with   Congress about the tax, but Trump also could also possibly use   the International Emergency Economic Powers Act (IEEPA) to   pass the tax without congressional approval. ’
