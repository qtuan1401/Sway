I can’t stop accidentally doing wrongthink 😢😢 pic. twitter.   —   BLAIRE WHITE 💋 (@MsBlaireWhite) February 21, 2017,  White told Breitbart News, “Facebook has repeatedly shown their dedication to censoring libertarian and conservative pages. They’ve also shown that their claim to want to protect minorities is disingenuous, as they have no problem booting minorities from their website if they have the wrong opinion. ” Facebook has previously temporarily suspended other   justice figures for going against the mainstream leftist narrative. Libertarian commentator Lauren Southern was also suspended for 30 days for questioning the ban of another Trump supporter. After reaching out to Facebook for comment on the situation, a representative stated that “this was a mistake. Her account should be restored and she should be able to use it normally. ” Many other pages and people have had their permanent bans or suspensions lifted following Breitbart reporting most recently, the popular comedy page Polandball, which faced permanent deletion, was reinstated after Breitbart coverage.
