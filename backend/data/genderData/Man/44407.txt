’  ’ ’   A    girl from Tucson slammed Arizona Republican senator   Jeff Flake during a town hall on Thursday, grilling him over   his support for a law that will give states the right to   deny Title X funds to   centers that also provide   abortions, like Planned Parenthood.  ’ ”   President Trump signed the bill into law on Thursday, the same   day as Flake’s town hall, and it was seen by many as a strike at   Planned Parenthood, which uses Title X money to provide   healthcare to millions of   women across the   country.  ” ’   ”Jeff Flake, my name is Deja Foxx and I’’m a    from   Tucson,” Foxx began. ”I just want to state some facts. So, I’’m a   young woman, and you’’re a   man. I’’m a person of color,   and you’’re white. I come from a background of poverty, and I   didn’’t always have parents to guide me through life. You come   from privilege,” she continued, amid shouts of support from the   crowd.  ’ ’   ”So, I’’m wondering, as a Planned Parenthood patient and someone   who relies on Title X, who you are clearly not, why it’’s your   right to take away my right to choose Planned Parenthood and to   choose    birth control, to access that,” Foxx said. ”So,   if you can explain that to me, I would appreciate it.” ’ ’   Her comments drew raucous applause from the audience, and Flake   waited for the noise to die down before addressing Foxx.  ’ ’   ”I’’m glad to hear of my privileged childhood,” Flake said, before   adding that he was one of 11 children and paid his own college   tuition.  ’ ’   ”Privilege comes in many forms,” Foxx shot back.  ’ ’   Flake acknowledged that and said, ”I’’ve had a lot of advantages   that others haven’’t.  ’ ’  ’ ’  ’ ’  ’ ’ ’ ’     ’ ’A    girl from Tucson slammed Arizona. ..’ ’’ ’’ ’’
