Former Blackwater CEO and U. S. Navy SEAL veteran Erik Prince joined Breitbart’s Milo Yiannopoulos during the latest episode of The Milo Yiannopoulos Show to discuss Prince’s gay fanbase. [“I threw a gays for Trump party at the RNC, and I had a conversation with a couple of people there  …     did you know you had quite the gay fanbase? Do you have any idea why that might be?” asked Milo.  “I have no idea why that must be,” laughed Prince. “I mean all these words tumble out of your mouth that sound like they’re directly from a casting call for a gay softcore movie, there’s so many,” joked Milo. “Battered, and bruised, and tanned  …    ” “I don’t know, maybe it’s the short hair,” Prince quipped. “Well listen, if nothing else, I’m happy to have introduced you to, I’m sure, a branch of your fandom that you probably didn’t know before today,” replied Milo. “I would love to get them all a Blackwater ” added Prince. “Well, I’m sure, I’m sure, there’s a certain sort of chiq about it” proclaimed Milo. “I’ve been thinking with some friends recently that we should do a sort of high fashion shoot, basically in   gear, with Trump militia on flags. ” “No, no Trump militia!” interrupted Prince.
