British singer Adele urged fans attending her concert in Miami Tuesday night not to vote for Republican presidential candidate Donald Trump, while Democratic candidate Hillary Clinton was in the audience on the eve of her 69th birthday. [“I am English but what happens in America affects me too,” the    “Hello” singer told the crowd at American Airlines Arena in Miami, according to Entertainment Weekly.  “Don’t vote for him,” she added, apparently referring to Trump. “I can’t vote but I am 100 percent for Hillary Clinton, I love her, she’s amazing. ” Local NBC reporter Adam Kuperstein posted video on social media of Adele’s endorsement: Adele with Hillary Clinton in attendance at Miami concert: ”Don’t vote for him!” @AAarena #Adele (via Aaron Resnick) pic. twitter.   —   Adam Kuperstein (@AdamNBC6) October 26, 2016,  Adele hadn’t previously weighed in on the 2016 presidential race, but the singer has become known for her   banter during concerts. It wasn’t immediately clear if Adele knew that Clinton was in the audience Tuesday night. According to the Associated Press, journalists covering Clinton’s campaign were not permitted to accompany the candidate inside the arena for the concert. Clinton was in South Florida earlier Tuesday for a series of events, including a fundraiser at a home in Pinecrest and an early voting rally at Broward College in Coconut Creek, according to CBS Miami. The AP described Clinton’s motorcade as having made a “surprise stop” at the American Airlines Arena following the last fundraiser. “It’s going to be a close election. Pay no attention to the polls. Don’t be complacent,” Clinton reportedly told   at Broward College. “I’m asking you most importantly to vote for yourselves because that is what is at stake. ” Trump was also in Florida this week as polling stations across the state opened for early voting on Tuesday.
