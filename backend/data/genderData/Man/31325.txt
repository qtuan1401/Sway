Democratic presidential nominee Hillary Clinton is detailing her plans for her final campaign rally. [She says she’ll make a last visit to Philadelphia, Pennsylvania on the day before Election Day.  But Clinton will not be alone. President Obama and Michelle Obama will join her on stage as well as her husband Bill Clinton and her daughter Chelsea Clinton. This will be the first time that Bill Clinton and Hillary Clinton have campaigned together since they were at the Democratic National Convention in Philadelphia. The Obamas have been acting as surrogates for Clinton, as the president has campaigned tirelessly for her in the final week of the campaign. First Lady Michelle Obama joined Hillary Clinton for a rally in North Carolina. Throughout the campaign, Clinton has relied on more popular surrogates including Sen. Bernie Sanders, Sen. Elizabeth Warren, Vice President Joe Biden, and former Vice President Al Gore, to try to energize Democratic voters. Her final rally, therefore, will be less about change, and more about continuing the same policies sought by the Obama administration and the first Clinton administration. It also suggests that the campaign sees Pennsylvania as the most important state to keep Democratic, as they face more difficult odds against Donald Trump in Florida and North Carolina. Clinton will spend Election Day in New York City at Manhattan’s Javits Center.
