GOP frontrunner Donald Trump says it was “pretty unusual” that Justice Scalia  —   who passed away on Saturday  —   was found with a pillow over his face. [During an interview with talk show host Michael Savage on “Savage Nation,” the host asked: “Donald, I need to come back to the topic we’ve all been screaming about here, which is Scalia, was he murdered,” Savage questioned. “I know it’s pretty brutal to say that, and I’m not wanting to drag you into this, but this is going to be bigger and bigger and bigger. ”  “I went on the air and said we need the equivalent of a Warren Commission, we need an immediate autopsy before the body is disposed of,” Savaged added. “What do you think of that?” Trump avoided giving a straight answer, saying he didn’t know enough. “Well I just heard today  …     you know I just landed and I’m hearing it’s a big topic,” Trump responded, not giving a direct answer. “But they say they found a pillow on his face, which is a pretty unusual place to find a pillow,” Trump added. “I can’t tell you —   I can’t give you an answer. ”
