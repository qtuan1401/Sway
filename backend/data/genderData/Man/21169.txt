Earlier this week on Fox Business Network’s “Cavuto: Coast to Coast,” Home Depot   Bernie Marcus said to his fellow Republicans if you’re not behind Republican presidential nominee Donald Trump, you’re electing Democratic nominee Hillary Clinton.   Marcus said, “If you’re going to stay neutral, you might as well vote for her because your lack of vote for Donald means she’s going to get elected anyway. ” He added, “When I listen to Hillary Clinton and I listen to the economists who never in their life ever hired a human being or trained a human being, I say, I don’t know the world that they belong in. I know that when you have high taxes that you kill off jobs. Killing off jobs means hurting America. It means hurting the economic wealth of America  —   and that’s not good for anybody. ” Follow Pam Key on Twitter @pamkeyNEN
