Hillary Clinton has sunk to new lows even for her, by trying to tie the Ku Klux Klan and other hate groups to Donald Trump and his historic run for President. [As an   and an enthusiastic supporter of Trump I am deeply offended by this but can’t say I am surprised.  The Clintons are the undisputed “masters of media manipulation and misdirection” as they try to cover up their illicit activities at the Clinton Foundation and her questionable dealings at the State Department. Hillary Clinton hopes that the media will chase this phony story so that they will cease from covering the real story which is the corruption, cronyism and “pay to play” environment she allowed while she was America’s top diplomat. She also wants to mislead   voters into believing that Trump’s sincere and heartfelt outreach to minority communities’ is not real. In all honesty, the real bigots are the people who cynically take our votes for granted and pay lip service to the challenging issues that face our communities every day. For years,   have been told to vote for Democrats and things would get better. They haven’t and in some cases things have gotten worse. Trump has challenged   voters to question their unfaltering allegiance to the Democratic Party. We should accept his challenge. After all, the definition of insanity is doing the same thing over and over and expecting a different outcome.  The African American community deserves better than the failed Democrat policies of the last 50 years. Aaron T. Manaigo, Great America PAC   and Senior Adviser
