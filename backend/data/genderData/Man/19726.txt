Former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton is blaming internet websites for eroding her trustworthiness poll numbers. [“A lot of what people read about me in certain corners of the internet and a lot of what Donald Trump says about me is just that same nonsense,” she said during a speech at the International Women’s luncheon, referring to a long history of political attacks.  Clinton said she was troubled by polling numbers which show that voters didn’t trust her, and she put the blame on political opponents and conspiracy theories about her. “I could say that political opponents and conspiracy theorists have accused me of every crime in the book over the years,” she added. “None of it’s true, never has been. ” Clinton grew reflective, admitting that she had “work to do” to convince voters that she was trustworthy. “You know, you hear 25 years worth of wild accusations, anyone would start to wonder,” she said. “And it is certainly true that I’ve made mistakes. I don’t know anyone who hasn’t. So I understand why people have questions. ” Clinton insisted that she wasn’t hiding anything. “I can say the reason I sometimes sound careful with my worlds is not that I’m hiding something  —   it’s just that I’m careful with my words,” she said. She lamented that more Americans had lost their trust in government and other professional institutions like the media, businesses, religion, and even professional sports. “It is crucial for this country to get this back,” she said. “I will do everything I can to rebuild our trust in our government. ”
