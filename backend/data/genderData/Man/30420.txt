On the Sunday broadcast of “The Cats Roundtable” on New York City’s AM 970, host John Catsimatidis spoke about the upcoming 2016 presidential election with economist Arthur Laffer, a former member of President Ronald Reagan’s economic policy advisory board.  Laffer not only predicted a victory for the GOP, but he would be “surprised” if they did not take as many as 47 of the 50 states. “I would be surprised if the Republicans don’t take 45, 46, 47 states out of the 50,” he said. “I mean, I think we’re going to landslide this election. ” “I think Donald Trump is phenomenal, I think Rand Paul has done a great job, I even like Jeb Bush. I think Jeb Bush is great, he did a wonderful job in Florida. Chris Christie  —   phenomenal,” Laffer added. He later said Democratic candidate Hillary Clinton’s “day is over. ” “I don’t think Hillary’s going to win this election no matter whom she runs against. I mean, Hillary’s day is over. ” Follow Trent Baker on Twitter @MagnifiTrent
