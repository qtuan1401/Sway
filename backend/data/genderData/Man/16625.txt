On this weekend’s brodcast of “Fox News Sunday,” when asked about being considered for the post of   Donald Trump’s White House press secretary, conservative radio talk show host Laura Ingraham said, “I’m always open to new adventures. ”  When asked if she is still under consideration to be the White House press secretary Ingraham said, “Yes and I guess so. I really don’t have anything new to say about it other than the fact that, you know, it’s an intriguing idea. It really is a great privilege to be considered. they have a really good team. You know Kellyanne obviously is phenomenal, first woman to run a presidential campaign. I know Sean Spicer is over there doing great stuff  —  if you like Jason Miller. So they have a lot of good people over there. It’s nice to be considered. I’m always open to new adventures. ” Follow Pam Key on Twitter @pamkeyNEN
