Presumptive Republican presidential nominee Donald Trump couldn’t resist some fun at President Barack Obama’s expense after the shocking vote by the United Kingdom to leave the European Union. [Trump recalled Obama’s trip to London in April, urging British citizens to vote to stay in the European Union.  “I actually was actually very surprised that President Obama would have come here and he would have been so bold as to tell the people over here what to do,” Trump said during a press conference at his golf course in Scotland today. He said that Obama’s comments probably did more damage to the side that wanted to stay in the EU. “He came in and really tried to convince people to stay,” Trump said. “And I thought it was inappropriate. ” He also criticized Obama for trying to control world affairs. “He’s constantly dictating to the world what they should do,” Trump said. Trump also mocked Hillary for advocating that the United Kingdom remained in the EU, suggesting that she was only following orders from Obama. “She has misread this,” Trump said. “And I was surprised that she was so bold   …     the only reason she did it is because Obama wanted it. You know, if Obama wanted it the other way, if he said leave, she would have said leave. ” “She does whatever he wants her to,” Trump added. “Now, you know why, but that’s OK, we don’t have to get into that. ”
