Presumptive GOP nominee Donald Trump reacted to James Comey’s statement that the FBI Director won’t recommend criminal prosecution against presumptive Democratic nominee Hillary Clinton on her use of a private email server during her time as Secretary of State. [Trump blames Comey’s recommendation against filing criminal charges on a rigged system.  The system is rigged. General Petraeus got in trouble for far less. Very very unfair! As usual, bad judgment.  —   Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) July 5, 2016,  FBI director said Crooked Hillary compromised our national security. No charges. Wow! #RiggedSystem,  —   Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) July 5, 2016,  Trump has often talked about the rigged political system while on the campaign trail. Although Comey suggested there shouldn’t be any criminal charges against Clinton, he did note her careless actions, which did involve top secret information at the time emails were sent and received.
