GOP frontrunner Donald Trump tells Breitbart News Daily on SiriusXM with host Stephen K. Bannon that Bill and Hillary Clinton have a net worth of more than $100 million dollars, referencing Breitbart News editor Peter Schweizer’s book, Clinton Cash. [“To get to the numbers, they made speeches, they got paid a fortune for the speeches,” Trump said of the countries and companies that paid for the Clintons to speak, pointing to “the way they got treated in government. ”  In Clinton Cash, Schweizer investigates the Clintons’ paid speeches and foreign donations made to the Clinton Foundation, arguing that several of the donations came in from groups bidding for government contracts during Hillary Clinton’s time as Secretary of State. “I think we’ll whip out that book because that book will become very pertinent. I’m surprised it hasn’t been used by Sanders,” Trump added, saying Clinton Cash was   and factual. Breitbart News Daily airs on SiriusXM Patriot 125 weekdays from 6 a. m. to 9 a. m. EST. LISTEN:
