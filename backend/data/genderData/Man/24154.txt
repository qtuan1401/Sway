Tuesday in an appearance on FBN’s “Lou Dobbs Tonight,” former U. S. Navy SEAL Team Six Leader Rob O’Neill pointed to the timing of Khizr Khan’s participation in presidential election politics and declared him to be “part of the Clinton machine. ”  “It is unfortunate,” O’Neill said. “They shouldn’t be politicizing it. And there was no mistake he came out for the Clintons. He’s worked for the Clintons before and there have been three presidential elections since his son was killed. They could have come out for  —   this is one he decided to come out for. This is part of the Clinton machine. There’s no mistake that Mr. Trump was interviewed by George Stephanopoulos. He’s in the Clinton camp as well and this is how Clinton politics work as opposed to going on Hillary’s record we’re just going to how bad you are. ” (  RCP Video) Follow Jeff Poor on Twitter @jeff_poor
