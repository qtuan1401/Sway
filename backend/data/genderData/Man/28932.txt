David Brock issued a statement Tuesday through a   Clinton Super PAC asserting that Donald Trump should fire his campaign manager Corey Lewandowski. [Correct The Record founder David Brock released the following statement after Trump campaign manager Corey Lewandowski was charged with battery against former Breitbart reporter Michelle Fields. “Donald Trump’s campaign has come to be known for his outrageous lies and violent rallies, violence encouraged by the candidate himself,” said David Brock. “Now Donald Trump’s campaign manager, who has a history of aggressive behavior, has lied about his own violent behavior toward a reporter —  violence which is now available on tape for the world to see. Not only is this a direct reflection on Trump, but it also demonstrates the consequences of his hateful, divisive and violent rhetoric. “Unless he wants the violence to continue, Trump needs to end the reality TV show that his campaign has become and tell Lewandowski, ‘You’re Fired. ’” Lewandowski was charged with misdemeanor battery by police in Jupiter, Florida for allegedly yanking on Fields’ arm as she asked Trump a question at the Trump National Golf Club on March 8th.
