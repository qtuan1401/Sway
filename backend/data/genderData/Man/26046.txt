Thursday on MSNBC while discussing Green Party presidential nominee Jill Stein raising enough money online to initiate recounts of the presidential vote in the swing states of Michigan, Pennsylvania and Wisconsin, host Craig Melvin said it was his “own personal theory,” that this could be an early effort to “delegitimize”   Donald Trump before he is sworn in.  Melvin said, “I would like to float another theory out there  my own personal theory perhaps, that this could be an effort, an early effort to try and delegitimize a president before he’s sworn in. If you can create this idea, plant this seed with a significant number of people in the country, that it was rigged —  oh, the irony —  then, perhaps, maybe that’s  —   maybe that’s part of it. ” Follow Pam Key on Twitter @pamkeyNEN
