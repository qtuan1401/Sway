Pat Caddell spoke to Breitbart News Daily SiriusXM host Alex Marlow Thursday morning about Wednesday night’s    Forum on NBC, saying, “I don’t think she has a narrative to capitalize on, other than, ‘Trump is dangerous, unfit to be  ’ which is hard to make when you’re not showing that you’re in total command yourself,” said Caddell. [Caddell also said:  I thought as I watched it, I thought, every time she [Hillary Clinton] can’t answer a question —  which is almost every time —  in one sentence or two, she rambles on, and you can tell she’s lying, she’s lying, she’s lying. Whether it has to do with knowing the facts or not, it’s just what comes across as she’s trying to make things up and throw them in. “She was on the defensive last night,” Caddell said, continuing: She was hit by all sides by different points of the audience, who were very polite to her. Even the man who suggested he would be in prison for doing what she did  —   the first question out of the box. But everything was, “I was wrong and so was Donald Trump, and he hasn’t taken responsibility. ” Caddell stated, “By the way, the new argument that ‘I used a classified server for classified documents,’ where the hell did that come from? I mean, that was just out of left field. ” He went on to say, “I was on my heels listening: ‘Oh, my gosh, what are you talking about?’ She keeps going back to the same lies, and she gets away with it because Lauer doesn’t follow up. ” “She looked defensive and sounded defensive, and the mainstream media is just flipping out because they don’t know what to do,” Caddell concluded.
