’  ’ ’   President Donald Trump attacked three prominent members of the   conservative House Freedom Caucus on Twitter Thursday for their   opposition to the Republican healthcare bill. ’ ’   Trump went after Rep. Mark Meadows, chair of the Freedom Caucus,   Rep. Jim Jordan, its deputy chair, and Rep. Raul Labrador for   opposing the American Health Care Act  —   the plan to repeal and   replace Obamacare that stalled in the House last week. ’ ’   The resistance from conservative members forced Trump and House   Speaker Paul Ryan to pull the AHCA from the House floor roughly   30 minutes before it was scheduled for a vote. ’ ’   ”If @RepMarkMeadows, @Jim_Jordan and @Raul_Labrador would get on   board we would have both great healthcare and massive tax cuts   & reform,” Trump wrote, directly tagging the official   accounts of the three lawmakers. ’ ’   Most of the Freedom Caucus rejected the AHCA because they felt it   did not go for enough in its repeal of Obamacare, officially   named the Affordable Care Act. ’ ’   Trump insisted in the tweetstorm that the AHCA was not only meant   as a repeal bill, but also as a replacement for the ACA. ’ ’   ”RepMarkMeadows, @Jim_Jordan Raul_Labrador? #RepealANDReplace #Obamacare,” Trump   tweeted. ’ ’ ’ ’ ’t’t’tWhere are   and ?  ’ ’   The tweets continued a broader assault from Trump on   the Freedom Caucus since the AHCA debacle. He tweeted about   the group  ’ ’   Labrador responded to the earlier tweets on Thursday by defending   the Freedom Caucus, many of whose members were early supporters   of Trump. ’ ’   ”Freedom Caucus stood with u when others ran. Remember who your   real friends are. We’’re trying to help u succeed,” Labrador   wrote. ’ ’   Divisions between the Freedom Caucus and moderate members of   the House GOP conference helped sink the legislation. ’ ’President Donald Trump attacked three prominent. ..’ ’’ ’’ ’’
