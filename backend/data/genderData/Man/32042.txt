Washington (CNN) An imam will issue the Muslim call to prayer at an interfaith service on Saturday to mark   Donald Trump’s inauguration, according to the inaugural committee. Imam Mohamed Magid of the All Dulles Area Muslim Society Center, also known as the ADAMS Center, in Sterling, Virginia, will be one of 26 people offering prayers and reading from Scripture at the National Prayer Service that follows the   ceremony. The service occurs at the Washington National Cathedral. Trump has cast himself as a fierce opponent of ”radical Islam,” and some Muslim groups have taken offense in his rhetoric that they say targets all adherents of Islam. In response, Trump has maintained that he has deep ties to the Muslim community. One of Trump’s most controversial policies has been a plan to temporarily end all Muslim immigration to the United States, though he has since said he only want to ban immigration from unspecified countries with heavy terrorist activity. Magid has worked to   Muslim youths recruited by Islamic militant groups such as ISIS, and the ADAMS Center has earned praise from the FBI ”for their leadership role in building partnerships between law enforcement and the Muslim community to enhance mutual cooperation and public safety.”
