Hillary Clinton leads Donald Trump by six points in New Jersey, according to a Stockton poll published Friday. [Ten percent of the likely voters said they would vote for “nobody,”   a candidate, or possibly vote for a   candidate.  The first presidential debate on Monday occurred during the polling period, but according to the results, Clinton led Trump by four points before the debate. Her lead increased to six points after Monday night’s debate. The poll questioned 638 likely voters in New Jersey from Sept. 22 to Sept. 29 and has a margin of error of plus or minus 3. 9 percent. “New Jersey is a blue state, so it’s not surprising Clinton is ahead,” said Hughes Center Executive Director Sharon Schulman, which conducted the poll. “But there are still 14 percent who are undecided or not choosing either Clinton or Trump at this point. ”
