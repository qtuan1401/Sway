President Barack Obama headed out for another round of golf Sunday prior to ending his 16 day Martha’s Vineyard vacation on schedule. [Obama hit the links with investor Glenn Hutchins, Robert Wolf, the former CEO of UBS investment bank and Washington lawyer Cy Walker this afternoon, at Farm Neck Golf Club.  This is the tenth and final round of golf for the president as he wraps up his vacation. Obama drew criticism for refusing to end his vacation prematurely to visit the devastation caused by historic flooding in Louisiana. After Republican presidential candidate Donald Trump drew attention to the area by visiting on Friday, the White House announced that the president would also visit the disaster area on Tuesday  —   once his vacation was over. Hillary Clinton has also spent the weekend on Martha’s Vineyard attending fundraisers and hosting a birthday party for her husband Bill Clinton.
