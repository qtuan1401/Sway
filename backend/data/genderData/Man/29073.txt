As the dramatic campaign to replace him continues, President Barack Obama appears to be enjoying his golfing vacation in Martha’s Vineyard. [The president went golfing again on Friday afternoon  —   the fifth time in six days. His golfing partners include prominent NBA stars: Stephen Curry of the Golden State Warriors, Chris Paul of the Los Angeles Clippers, and retired players Alonzo Mourning and Ray Allen.  Obama has also spent late nights at restaurants with friends and family and an evening at the home of Robert Wolf, a former UBS executive. The only day so far that the president didn’t golf, he spent on the beach with his family and taking a walk on his expansive vacation property with his daughter Malia Obama. Although Republican presidential nominee Donald Trump accused the president of being the “founder of ISIS” the White House has not responded, releasing only his Summer Spotify playlists and his Summer reading list. Next week the president will host a DNC fundraiser at a private home on Martha’s Vineyard. This is Obama’s last August summer vacation as president.
