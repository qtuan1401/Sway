Wednesday night on CNN, political commentator Bob Beckel said that Democratic presidential   Hillary Clinton could beat Republican presidential   Donald Trump even if she ends up in prison as a result of the FBI investigation into her handling of classified material on an unsecured email server in her home, during her tenure as secretary of state.  Beckel  said “In the end, the   Halloween mask this October will be Donald Trump’s face. You go onto a college campus and mention Donald Trump, and people flee for the wood work. Remind me I said this. She will crush him. I mean she could crush him from jail. ” Follow Pam Key on Twitter @pamkeyNEN
