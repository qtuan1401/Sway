As a planned Donald Trump rally in Chicago was canceled Friday night, leftist protesters online wasted no time in taking a victory lap for the   shutdown. [Way to go Chicago! Someone finally shutdown a Trump rally!  —   Pat Fuller (@bannerite) March 12, 2016,   The alliance of   protesters included illegal immigration activists working with their comrades in Black Lives Matter. The social justice warriors seem to take special delight in the idea that Americans who had showed up to hear Trump speak now had to face protesters. Chicago just shut Donald trump rally down! !! #BlackLivesMatter and all other groups !! Thank you,  —   MARCH 23rd (@PrincessKenKen2) March 12, 2016,  #DumpTrump protesters: you are heroes and sheroes. bless you all. #STL #TrumpChicago #BlackLivesMatter,  —   thereisno (@peaceshesaid) March 12, 2016,  Hey, #Chicago!

Protesters were being abused @ these #Trump   KKK rallies. NOT GOING TO STAND FOR THAT BS! #BlackLivesMatter @MSNBC @cnn,  —   Jon E (@financejonE) March 12, 2016,  Other online activists mocked Donald Trump and compared his event cancellation to the Bernie Sanders event cancellation sparked by two Black Lives Matter activists last year. Remember how Trump mocks Bernie for allowing the #BlackLivesMatter protestors to speak?  #TrumpRally,  —   Earth Muffin (@EarthMuffinHugs) March 12, 2016,  Trump ridiculed Bernie for giving #BlackLivesMatter his microphone. Trump gave them the entire #TrumpRally.  —   Carmine Sabia (@CarmineSabia) March 12, 2016,  More ominously, others hailed the protesters’ victory against Donald Trump and his supporters as an indication of things to come. Some referenced a planned rally in Cleveland. It is time for a new movement. We must focus our attention to shut down Trump #ShutDownTrump #BlackLivesMatter,  —   Jerry Ford, Jr. (@JerryFordJr) March 12, 2016,  #TRUMP RALLY HAS BEEN POSTPONED IN #CHICAGO#CLEVELAND BE SAFE!

A group that condones violence against those that don’t agree with them. #TrumpRally,  —   Josh Mills (@JG_KB24fan) March 12, 2016,  I think the violent #BlackLivesMatter goons swayed a lot of voters over to voting Trump today. Ppl are fed up with these racist thugs,  —   JakeBradford (@jake_bradford_1) March 12, 2016,  A statement by the Trump campaign said, “Mr. Trump just arrived in Chicago and after meeting with law enforcement has determined that for the safety of all of the tens of thousands of people that have gathered in and around the arena, tonight’s rally will be postponed to another date. ” It is unclear at press time how much of a role the Chicago police played in the Trump campaign’s decision.
