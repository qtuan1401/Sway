’  ’ ’   A video taken in 2011 has surfaced of Donald Trump joking   that former Miss Universe Jennifer Hawkins is ”not very   bright” in front of a crowd of thousands before grabbing and   kissing her. ’ ’   The video,  showed a corporate speech   Trump gave in Sydney, Australia in which he called Hawkins to the   stage to demonstrate a point about using revenge to succeed in   business. ’ ’   He first explained to the audience that he had been angry with   Hawkins because he thought she had declined to introduce him at   the event. ’ ’   ”I’’ll give you an example: Jennifer Hawkins. Where’’s Jennifer?   Where’’s she sitting? Get over here, Jennifer,” Trump said. ”This   is about getting even.” ’ ’   Hawkins, laughing, explained there was a ”miscommunication with   her management.” ’ ’   ”Of course I wanted to come here,” she said. ’ ’   Trump continued: ”I was actually going to get up and tell   you that Jennifer is a beautiful girl on the outside, but she’’s   not very bright. That wouldn’’t have been true, but I would have   said it anyway.” ’ ’   He then explained, using a sexual pun, that Hawkins attended the   event after all. ’ ’   ”You know what? She came tonight. She came  —   came, she came, she   came,” he said, adding that ”they have some filthy minds in   Australia” after the audience laughed. ’ ”   Trump then put his arm around Hawkins’ waist and kissed her, as   she turned her head and put her forearm against his chest to push   him away. ” ’ ’ ’   Hawkins has not commented on the video, and  to answer questions about Trump. ’ ’   The video followed several weeks of sexual misconduct accusations   levied against Trump. Women started coming forward after a 2005   video surfaced of Trump boasting about grabbing and kissing women   without their consent. ’ ’   Trump has denied the allegations and said he will sue his   accusers after the election. ’
