On Saturday’s broadcast of MSNBC’s “AM Joy,” Senate Minority Leader Senator Harry Reid ( ) argued Russia’s involvement in the 2016 election is a thousand times worse than 2000’s hanging chads and that   Donald Trump “lost the election, actually by about 3 million votes, but we have the system we have here, which, by the way, should change very soon. ”  Reid responded to a question on whether he thought about Russian intervention in the 2016 election undermined Trump’s incoming administration by saying, “Well, Trump’s the president. He was elected, you know, this is a hanging chad 1, 000 times over. He lost the election, actually by about 3 million votes, but we have the system we have here, which, by the way, should change very soon. ” Follow Ian Hanchett on Twitter @IanHanchett
