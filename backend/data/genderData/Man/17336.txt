Just days after making fools of themselves with dire warnings about how jeers from Trump supporters could lead to mob  violence and Nazi Germany, our lying, corrupt DC Media is back to clutching their pearls and demanding safe spaces after Donald Trump told a crowd of supporters that he would like to punch a protester in the face.  The   Washington Post: Donald Trump said he wanted to punch a protester “in the face” after the man disrupted a campaign rally in Las Vegas on Monday night. “Here’s a guy, throwing punches, nasty as hell, screaming at everything else, when we’re talking,” Trump told the crowd, although CNN reported the man did not appear to be fighting with security officers. “The guards are very gentle with him. He’s walking out, like, big   smiling, laughing,” Trump continued, before saying to loud cheers: “I’d like to punch him in the face, I tell ya. ” As I wrote just yesterday: Keep in mind that this is the exact same made that ensured President Obama paid no political price after his team accused Mitt Romney of murder in 2012 the exact same media that looked the other way when Obama said, “If they bring a knife to the fight, we bring a gun” and “argue with neighbors, get in their face“ the exact same media that downplayed the beating Kenneth Gladney just hours after a top Obama official called on supporters to “Hit back twice as hard. ” When Obama’s base riots and loots in Ferguson and Baltimore, the media asks us to “understand. ” When Trump supporters jeer, the media warns of The Apocalypse. Because our political media is nothing more than an arm of the Democrat Party, Obama was never made to pay a political price for any of that. In fact, the media loved it. After 8 years of covering for Barack Obama endless sins, our media has absolutely zero credibility when it comes to issues like this. And we must never stop reminding them of that fact.
