’     This extremely long and detailed nightmare I’m having in which     Donald Trump has been elected president of the United States is     getting darker. My very fertile, very thorough imagination has     now produced a Time cover —  which, given the     internal and inexorable logic of the fantasy,     features . I am not going to litigate whether or not this choice     was appropriate, because everyone involved in the decision is a     figment of my overheated brain, but Ben        that Time has long selected     distasteful individuals, including Hitler, Stalin, and Putin,     for POY honor. (Not to mention that in election years, the     magazine typically opts for the  .)   ’ ’     Anyway, here’s the image.   ’ ’  ’ ’     Creepy, no? On Twitter, Helen Rosner observes that       photographer Nadav Kander incorporated aesthetic flourishes     from 1940s studio portraiture: a “Kodachrome palette,”     “   physicality,” lots of shadow, and luxurious     props.   ’ ’     Maybe the point of these ’40s tropes is to suggest that Trump,     as promised by his hat, out of which he talks, will renew the     “Greatest Generation. ” Maybe it’s to imply the opposite: that     the PEOTUS is a Nazi. (Certainly something about the chair and     the   angle of his head —  what one colleague terms his     “evil coquette look” —  evokes Time’s     1938 Mensch of the Jahr.)   ’ ’     But even if the   references are accidental, or just     intend to communicate solemnity, the coldness and darkness of     the image seem notably menacing. Equally scary are     four that present Trump’s inner circle —  Bannon,     Conway, Priebus, and Pence —  unsmiling and sunk in gloom.   ’ ’     Over email, Kander declined to answer specific questions about     the photo shoot, but he did release the following statement     through his publicist:   ’ ’  ’ ’     This is a pretty diplomatic hedge for a creature born from my     subconscious. Not so diplomatic? The   devil horns     protruding out of the presidential pate.   ’ ’     Is it possible that Time’s editors did this     without realizing it?   ’ ”Slate designer Derreck Johnson     expressed skepticism. “The alignment with Trump’s head is just     too perfect,” he said. Noting that Time has     weaponized its pointy “M” in the past, he added that “this is     the first one I’ve seen where it’s not an extreme  .     It’s a full body thing. So it makes it stand out even more. ”   ” ’     Meanwhile, Trump took umbrage at the least offensive thing     about this Time cover, from his perspective:     the magazine’s  of him as     “President of the Divided States of America. ”   ’
