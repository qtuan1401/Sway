Friday from Plattsburgh, NY, Republican presidential   Donald Trump said when his rival Sen. Ted Cruz ( ) used the term “New York values,” he did so with “hatred toward New York. ”  Trump said, “During a debate, Cruz talked about New York values, oh New York values. Boy, he wished he didn’t say that, right? That was a bad thing. And he said it with hatred toward New York because he said it was hatred toward me. But me I don’t care about. But he said it with a lot of anger and a lot of hatred, and he was taking about everything that you know he was talking about. Now he is trying to make excuses saying ‘well I meant liberal, I meant liberal.’ He doesn’t mean liberal. ” Follow Pam Key on Twitter @pamkeyNEN
