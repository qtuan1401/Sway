’  ’ ’   House Speaker Paul Ryan responded to news that  by   encouraging voters to cast their ballots on Election Day for   Donald Trump. ’ ’   ”Let’’s bring the Clinton era to an end by voting for Donald Trump   on Tuesday,” Ryan said in a statement. ’ ”   The Wisconsin Republican’s direct mention of Trump was notable. ” ’   Ryan has criticized Trump throughout the 2016 election and said   last month that he  for the   Republican nominee. ’ ”   The House speaker’s relationship with Trump has been lukewarm at   best. He initially refused to endorse Trump’s candidacy and later   did so only in a tepid fashion. ” ’’ ”   But while Ryan has been a critic of Trump, he has been an even   stronger detractor of Clinton. His Sunday statement on the FBI’s   announcement zinged the former secretary of state for her   handling of classified information while she served as secretary   of state. ” ’   ”Regardless of this decision, the undisputed finding of the FBI’’s   investigation is that Secretary Clinton put our nation’’s secrets   at risk and in doing so compromised our national security,” he   said. ’ ’   Ryan added: ”She simply believes she’’s above the law and always   plays by her own rules. This is a pattern with the Clintons, and   the American people should not have to endure four more years of   their scandal and baggage.” ’ ’   With just two days to go until Election Day, both Clinton and   Trump were furiously crisscrossing the US in a frantic     push to turn out the vote in key battleground states. ’ ’   Polls in recent days have  though analysts still   favor Clinton to emerge as the victor Tuesday night. ’
