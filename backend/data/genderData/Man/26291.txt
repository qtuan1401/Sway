Sunday on NBC’s “Meet The Press,” Sen. Cory Booker ( ) said praised the protesters of   Donald Trump.  Booker said, “I’m sitting here right now having this conversation with you because of the tradition of American protest. I have my rights, not because of Washington, Strom Thurmond and others, suddenly deciding let’s give people rights but because of the voice of protesters. So when you have a president that in his campaign who ran saying things that not aren’t just contrary to fact but literally threatening to use presidential power in a way that would erode the rights and privileges and equality of large sections of Americans, God bless the protesters. But I will tell you this. i caution anyone who in their protest becomes the very thing that they’re protesting against. Meaning, turning to hateful speech, violating principles and ideals that are sacred in this country. We need to raise our voices, but we do not need to indulge in hate. ” Follow Pam Key on Twitter @pamkeyNEN
