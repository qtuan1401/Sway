At the third presidential debate, Donald Trump spoke of   abortions ripping babies apart.[ : TRUE,  Hillary Clinton was very uncomfortable with Donald Trump’s gruesome description of the   abortion procedure, but Trump was correct.   activists don’t like the term “  abortion,” preferring the more sanitized medical term “dilation and extraction. ” The basic idea behind the procedure is to remove the fetus partially from the womb, where it is most commonly killed by puncturing the skull with scissors or a similar implement.  However, there is a “dismemberment abortion” variation on the procedure, which does indeed involve ripping the fetus apart, to reduce the danger to the mother from the hazardous   abortion procedure.  As to how common such procedures are, there is some uncertainty about how often the procedure is used, but 500 to 1, 000 per year is often cited as an estimate. The Congressional Budget Office has estimated there are about 10, 000   abortions (20 weeks or later) per year, but the vast majority of them are not   abortions.
