[The show’s star,   Miranda, posted a photo of Clinton and her husband hanging out after the performance.  “Next president @HillaryClinton @HamiltonMusical   @Lin_Manuel  President @billclinton Luz @ltmphd  I happy 2 host,” Mirnada’s Twitter post read.

Miranda, Jr. (@Vegalteno) July 3, 2016,  Both Clintons also took a photo with the entire cast. The   Tony   cast of Hamilton is set to host a fundraiser for the Clinton presidential campaign and the Democratic National Committee later this month, with tickets for the July 12 show ranging from $2, 700 for general admission to $100, 000 for prime seating and an invitation to the Democrat National Convention. Breitbart News previously reported that DNC officials have in recent weeks courted Miranda to be a featured star at their national convention in Philadelphia in July. The    actor recently announced his departure from the hit Broadway musical. In addition to finishing the score for forthcoming Disney film Moana and rehearsing for a role in a   sequel to Mary Poppins, Miranda will contribute to a Latino voter registration effort aimed at preventing presumptive GOP presidential nominee Donald Trump from winning the White House in November.
