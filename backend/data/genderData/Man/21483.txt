Donald Trump campaigned against the Trans Pacific Partnership (TPP) trade deal during a rally in Michigan on Friday, vowing to rebuild Detroit. [“I’m going to bring back the jobs that have been stripped away from you and from our country,” Trump told thousands of people packed into the Suburban Collection Showplace in Novi, Michigan. “We’re going to rebuild Detroit. ”  Trump attacked his rival, Hillary Clinton, for calling the TPP the gold standard and charged that she will pass it because her donors want the deal. The Republican nominee alleged that Clinton praised TPP on 45 separate occasions and alleged that one in three companies, which lobbied for the TPP, donated to the Clinton Foundation. “She doesn’t believe in protecting American jobs or American sovereignty,” Trump charged about Clinton, saying she “only believes in protecting her special interests and her donors. ” “On Nov. 8, we are going to end Clinton corruption. We’ve had enough,” he declared. “We are going to put America first. ” Thousands of people waited in the rain for hours to get into Trump’s rally.
