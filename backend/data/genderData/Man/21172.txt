A new USA Today poll reveals that Hillary Clinton’s lead over Donald Trump has dropped to 5 points, 45. 6% to 40. 4%. Clinton had led Trump by 11 points in May, 50% TO 39%. [Her lead drops even further, to four points (39% %) when   candidates Gary Johnson (Libertarian) and Jill Stein (Green) are added into the mix.  The poll was conducted among 1, 000 likely voters, with a margin of error of 3%. USA Today adds: Clinton commands more positive allegiance than Trump.

Trump’s backers are more evenly divided on their motivation: 48% are mostly voting for him 39% are mostly voting against her. Still, Trump supporters are a bit more likely to say they’re “excited” about the election, 27% compared to 24%. Clinton supporters are a bit more likely to say they’re “alarmed,” 62% to 56%. And those in both camps vow their views are set in stone: More than nine of 10 of Clinton supporters and of Trump supporters say they is no chance they would switch to the other side. Just 12% of those surveyed are undecided, a smaller percentage than in the Suffolk Poll taken during the summer of the presidential race four years ago. In the survey, 53% have an unfavorable opinion of Clinton 60% have an unfavorable opinion of Trump. Nearly one in five respondents hold a negative view of them both  —   a swing group whose     choice could determine the outcome of a competitive election, says David Paleologos, director of the Suffolk University Political Research Center. (For some reason, USA Today claims: “Rounding would make the lead six points. ” However, the difference between Clinton’s and Trump’s poll numbers, 5. 2% would still be rounded down to 5.)
