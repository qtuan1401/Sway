’  ’ ’     Donald Trump told the New York Times  that his stance on   taking climate change action will depend on what it costs US   corporations.  ’ ’   In response to a question from the Times’’ editorial page editor,   James Bennet, about whether Trump thought ”human activity” is   connected to climate change, Trump replied that there is ”some”   connectivity, but that action from his administration depends on   ”how much it’’s going to cost our companies.”  ’ ’   ”You have to understand, our companies are noncompetitive right   now,” Trump said, adding that the US has lost 70, 000 factories   since George W. Bush’’s administration, and implied that it was   because of bad trade deals with other nations. ’ ’   ” ’ ’  ’ ’’ ’  ’ ’     ’ ’   ’
