Friday on Fox News Channel’s “The Kelly File,” Washington Post columnist Charles Krauthammer declared the legacy of President Barack Obama “toast” after the election Donald Trump, who will be backed by a   Congress.  “Obama’s legacy is toast,” Krauthammer said. “Obama’s legacy is gone. Which explains why he’s so desperately and unusually in American history campaigns so roughly against Donald Trump. He knew that so much of his accomplishments had been built on ramming stuff through the House and the Senate with very little consensus, in fact none on ObamaCare coming from the Republicans, on executive orders that are reversible with the stroke of a pen, on regulation that is easily reversible, that it collapses if and when his successor turns out to be a Republican. ” “And that’s what happened,” he continued. “And I think he’s going to end up as a parenthesis in American history in the sense that he thought when he came into office, he thought he was the Ronald Reagan of the left, meaning Reagan came in, he changed the ideological trajectory of the country, he turned it into a conservative country where that was sort of the underlying consensus. Obama thought he was going to change all of that and begin a liberal ascendency the way that Reagan began. A conservative ascendency. Well, it did not turn out that way. The country rejected his policies. Remember what Obama said when he was campaigning, I’m not on the ballot but my legacy is on the ballot. It was on the ballot and the country has rejected it. The idea that he would be the beginner of a new liberal ascendency is now dead and Obama I think understands that very well. ” Follow Jeff Poor on Twitter @jeff_poor
