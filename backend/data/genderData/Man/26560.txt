Amy Chozick of the New York Times stops listening to her heart and writes with her head about why Hillary Clinton lost Tuesday’s presidential election to Donald Trump. [From the New York Times:  Last year, a prominent group of supporters asked Hillary Clinton to address a prestigious St. Patrick’s Day gathering at the University of Notre Dame, an invitation that previous presidential candidates had jumped on. Barack Obama and Joseph R. Biden Jr. had each addressed the group, and former President Bill Clinton was eager for his wife to attend. But Mrs. Clinton’s campaign refused, explaining to the organizers that white Catholics were not the audience she needed to spend time reaching out to.

Though she would never have won this demographic, her husband insisted that her campaign aides do more to try to cut into Mr. Trump’s support with these voters. They declined, reasoning that she was better off targeting   suburban voters by hitting Mr. Trump on his temperament. Instead, they targeted the emerging electorate of young, Latino and   voters who catapulted Mr. Obama to victory twice, expecting, mistakenly, that this coalition would support her in nearly the same numbers. They did not. Read the rest of the story here.
