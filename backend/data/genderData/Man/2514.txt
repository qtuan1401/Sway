The British actor Jude Law, whose recent screen incarnations include playing a   warlord (the forthcoming “King Arthur: Legend of the Sword”) and the pope (in HBO’s “The Young Pope”) can now add wizardry to his oeuvre: He’ll play a young Albus Dumbledore in the next installment of “Fantastic Beasts and Where to Find Them,” J. K. Rowling’s prequel series to the Harry Potter tales. Played in the Harry Potter films by Richard Harris and then, after Mr. Harris’ death, Michael Gambon, Dumbledore is the beloved headmaster of the wizarding school Hogwarts. In the next “Fantastic Beasts,” Mr. Law’s Dumbledore will be the school’s professor of transfiguration. Released last November, the first “Fantastic Beasts” starred Eddie Redmayne and Katherine Waterston, and was a lucrative hit for Warner Bros. drawing $234 million domestically at the box office. It was Ms. Rowling’s first screenplay, and she has also written the second. David Yates, who directed the last four Harry Potter films as well as the first “Fantastic Beasts,” will return as director. The film is scheduled for a November 2018 release.
