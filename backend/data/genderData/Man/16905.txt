HBO host Bill Maher reacted to the uproar by students at Emory University over   Trump chalk writings by stating, “I so badly want to dropkick these kids” on Friday’s “Real Time. ”  After reading some of the negative reactions from the students to the writings, which caused former Michigan Governor Jennifer Granholm (D) to react negatively towards the students who were complaining, Maher stated, “I so badly want to dropkick these kids, into a place where there is actual pain and suffering. What happened in this country?” Comedian Jerrod Carmichael then reacted that he had “never felt more confident” in his decision to skip out on going to college. Maher added, “Everything seems to take a back seat to their feelings, and their sensitivity. Democracy, they don’t give a sh*t about. Free speech doesn’t matter. ” Follow Ian Hanchett on Twitter @IanHanchett
