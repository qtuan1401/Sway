Donald Trump has jumped into a   lead over Hillary Clinton, according to a new national poll of 800 likely voters by Emerson College. [Trump scored 43 percent to Clinton’s 41 percent. The poll’s margin of error is 3. 4 percent, so the apparent lead is basically    but Emerson has a good rating among pollsters. The poll was conducted from Sept. 11 to Sept. 13, amid rising public concerns over Clinton’s health.   Libertarian candidate Gary Johnson got 9 percent of the national vote, and Green Party’s Jill Stein got 2 percent, said Emerson. A separate poll by Emerson’s polling also gave Trump a   lead in Colorado, 42 percent to 38 percent. Trump holds the lead, partly because Johnson gets 13 percent in the state. Emerson also showed Trump ahead in Georgia by 6 points, by 13 points in Missouri, and by 28 points in Arkansas.  Each state poll included 600 likely voters, and each had an error margin of 3. 9 percent. The four state polls were conducted from Sept. 9 to Sept. 13.  Emerson’s new polls also show that more voters think Trump can win the race. “Only 45% of the national electorate [are] saying Clinton will win, compared to 43% who say Trump will” win, said Emerson.
