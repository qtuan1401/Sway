Caitlin Yilek at The Hill writes of conservative commentator Ann Coulter’s reaction to the reports that GOP presumptive nominee Donald Trump has chosen Indiana governor Mike Pence as his running mate. [As reports emerged that the presumptive GOP presidential nominee had chosen Indiana Gov. Mike Pence as his running mate, Coulter voiced her disappointment.  “Withholding comment until it’s official, but if claims about Pence as VP are correct, boy was I right about this being Trump’s first mistake,” Coulter wrote amid a series of tweets on Thursday.

Pence signed the measure into law but then asked the Legislature to water it down after widespread outrage.
