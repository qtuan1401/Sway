Trump touted former New York City Mayor Rudy Giuliani’s policies that he says brought down the crime rate by 76 percent and murder rate in New York City by more than 80 percent. “We need a national   agenda to make our cities safe again,” Trump stressed. “Safety is the foundation of the ladder to American success. ” He also praised law enforcement, saying they need support. “They are the line separating civilians and civilization from total chaos. ”
