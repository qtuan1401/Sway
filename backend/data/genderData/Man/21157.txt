Thursday on CNN’s “Wolf,” Sen. Rand Paul ( ) said Republican presidential nominee Donald Trump is more qualified than Democratic presidential nominee Hillary Clinton be    of the United States.  Partial transcript as follows: BLITZER: Very quickly, who’s more qualified to be commander in chief?  Hillary Clinton or Donald Trump? PAUL: Without question, I think Hillary Clinton would more likely get us involved in another war in the Middle East. She’s been for sending arms into Syria. From the very beginning, Donald Trump has said that he questioned the Iraq War. So that gives me some consolation that Donald Trump would be a better commander in chief because he at least had the foresight to see that the first —  the Iraq War led to a destabilization of the area and Hillary Clinton was on the other side of that.
