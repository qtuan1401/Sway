On Friday, HBO’s “Real Time” host Bill Maher argued that in many parts of the Muslim world, saying that you would protect gay people wouldn’t get applause like it did at the RNC, and that he disagrees with the Obama administration’s plan to bring in refugees from Syria, Afghanistan, and Iraq.  Maher said that of Tea Party is “a more bloodthirsty, less empathetic group of people, you can’t find in the world and even they, when Trump said he would protect LGBT people, and these are a lot of Christians who think gay is a sin, they cheered.   …     This does not happen in a lot of parts of the Muslim world. The idea that you would protect gay people.   …     And that is the difference between our cultures, and it’s important that we do recognize the difference. ” Maher then expressed his opposition to banning Muslims, but added that he disagrees with the Obama administration bringing in refugees from Syria, Afghanistan, and Iraq, “Unless we’re talking about  —   women and children are different. It’s the men who are the problem. Just like in this country. ” He later stated that, when it comes to Germany, “You either clean the country of all Muslims, or you live with some of this [terrorism.] Some people, but I don’t think in America we’d have to worry about that. ” Follow Ian Hanchett on Twitter @IanHanchett
