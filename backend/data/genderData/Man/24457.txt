Independents accounted for 19 percent of the survey, while 42 percent of those polled identified as Democrats and 36 percent identified as Republicans. The Free    poll questioned 600 likely voters and has a plus or minus four point margin of error. A Fox 2   poll shows Clinton with a six point lead over the Republican nominee. She held a 13 point lead in   before the final presidential debate in Las Vegas, Nevada. The results reveal Clinton’s edge with female voters decreased, as well as her support from Democrats. “For the first time, Clinton is weaker with Democrats (89% in the  ) than Trump is with Republicans (92% in the  ). Trump continues to have a strong lead with Independents (50% %),” notes the poll’s press release. The poll questioned 1, 030 likely voters on Oct. 25.
