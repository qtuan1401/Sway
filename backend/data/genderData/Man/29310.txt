On July 12, Hamilton creator and star   Miranda stood up at his show and welcomed Democratic presidential nominee Hillary Clinton to his show. [“This November, the difference could not be more stark, who do you think is going to get closer to those ideals?” he asked, referring to the Constitution and the founding fathers. “Are you going to vote for the guy who wants to build a wall, or for someone who’s building bridges?”  Miranda introduced Clinton as “the   president of the United States” as she took the stage to address the crowd. Why? Because it was a private fundraiser. Miranda hosted a special performance of the show exclusively for donors to Clinton’s presidential campaign. Tickets ranged from $2, 700 to a whopping $100, 000. “I have now seen it three times, first at the Public and twice here, and I cry every time,” Clinton said. Miranda tweeted a photo of himself with both Bill and Hillary Clinton urging America to “include women in the sequel” of the American story. Include women in the sequel. #WORK @HillaryClinton pic. twitter.   —     Miranda (@Lin_Manuel) July 12, 2016,  Clinton even quoted the play during her acceptance speech at the Democratic National convention. “Though ‘we may not live to see the glory,’ as the song from the musical ‘Hamilton’ goes, ‘let us gladly join the fight.’ Let our legacy be about ‘planting seeds in a garden you never get to see,’” Clinton said. Miranda has fiercely opposed Trump, even referring to him as “First National F*ckface,” and repeatedly criticizing his rhetoric on illegal immigrants. During his appearance on Saturday Night Live in October, Manuel suggested that Trump was a “piece of shit” and said that Trump was “never gonna be president. ” But that’s not all. Miranda also helped Clinton host a “Broadway for Hillary” event that raised even more money for her campaign as tickets ranged from $45 to $100, 000. He performed a parody of the song Ten Duel Commandments, changing into a   anthem. Lyrics below:          are ten things you need to do (number one!)

Look them in the eye, clear your throatSummon all the time you can devoteThen count (           paces, vote!) Since the hot Broadway show debuted, every liberal politician has struggled for a piece of the show and Miranda’s celebrity. President Barack Obama and First Lady Michelle Obama filmed a video lavishing praise on the show at the Tony Awards. Manuel, who visited the White House in 2009 to perform beat poetry for the Obamas, also performed a   music video with Obama at the White House. It’s no surprise, therefore, that Manuel chose to insert his politics into his hit Broadway musical. After the crew learned that Pence would attend, Manuel wrote the speech that criticized Vice   Mike Pence, delivered on the show by actor Brandon Victor Dixon. “You know, we have a guest in the audience this evening  —   Vice   Pence, I see you walking out but I hope you hear just a few more moments,” Dixon said, encouraging everyone to pull out their phones and tweet the speech to the world. Dixon warned Pence that “the diverse America” was “alarmed and anxious” the the Trump administration would not protect them. Manuel is currently on a widespread media tour to promote the Disney movie Moana, as he wrote the music for the film that opens in theaters on November 23.
