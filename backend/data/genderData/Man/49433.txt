’  ’ ”     Ohio congressman Tim Ryan is campaigning to replace Nancy     Pelosi as the House minority leader. In  he argued that Democrats need a     strategy for appealing to voters that doesn’t rely on .   ” ”     Indeed, Barack Obama can’t run again . .. OR CAN HE? ?? ” ’     Such is the question posed by      which was . .. well, it was posted by a friend of mine. It’’s     called ”President Obama: Run for Speaker of the House in 2018,”     and it outlines a practical and eminently constitutional path     by which Obama could become the    elected     official in America two years from now.   ’ ”     Here’s the whole deal: The  is in Illinois’ 1st Congressional District, which     is represented by . If Rush were to step aside in     2018 —  not entirely implausible, as he  and has served in the House since     1993 —  Obama could run for Rush’s seat while campaigning     nationally for other Democratic House candidates on the premise     that he’d be selected as Speaker if the party won a majority.   ” ”     The Dems will need to flip either  or  districts to take the 218     seats necessary to control the   chamber, and that     currently seems like a long shot —  but it’d be less of one with a     popular national figure to rally around. Current House Dem     leader Nancy Pelosi’s national favorability rating is  according to     Huffington Post’s poll aggregator; Obama’s approval     rating by the same measure is . As the     petition notes:   ” ”     Donald Trump, of course, lost the national popular vote and is     . Speaker     Obama would be a formidable national foil to President Trump,     and not just for the attention he’d command from the public and     the press.   ” ’  ’ ’     An Obama who occasionally  while mostly, like, working on his     memoirs is one thing. An Obama with  is another thing altogether, and the prospect of     putting such a trusted figure in a   position would     likely motivate midterm Democratic turnout more than anything     Obama may be planning to do as a civilian.   ’ ”     This plan wouldn’t be guaranteed of success even if Obama were     interested in it. (For what it’s worth, he reportedly does plan     to become involved on  in     organized efforts to improve the Democratic Party’s fortunes in     local races.)   ” ”     In 2012, Obama only beat Mitt Romney in  and his current     relatively high approval rating reflects the reality that, as a          he’s no longer involved in contentious     advocacy for specific policies. He’d likely become less popular     the minute he stepped back into the political fray. But the     hypothetical Obama for Speaker campaign would still pretty     clearly be the Democrats’ best chance at swinging Congress.   ” ’     There are also precedents in American history for both the     continued involvement of   in national government     and for the linkage of local House campaigns to a national     agenda. William Howard Taft became the chief justice of the     Supreme Court after his term in the White House, while John     Quincy Adams served in Congress for 17 years after leaving the     presidency.   ’ ”     More recently, Newt Gingrich organized the Republican Party’s     successful 1994 congressional takeback attempt around his own     potential Speakerdom and advocacy for the party’s  manifesto.     An Obama run for Speaker would be extremely surprising, but     there’s nothing stopping it from happening apart from his own     presumable interest in taking a break from the spotlight after     eight stressful years.   ” ”     On that note, though, it’s worth pointing out that Obama has     actually had a very short national political career thus far.     He was only elected to the Senate in 2004, and he’s only 55     years old today. That’s pretty young! In an era of shorter life     expectancy, John Quincy Adams ran for Congress at age 64 —  and,     as it happens, he did so after the election as president of a     with      who     engaged in  and had . Does history ever repeat itself as     neither tragedy nor farce, but as a reason for ?   ”
