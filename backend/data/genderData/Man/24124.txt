Donald Trump’s campaign is hitting Hillary Clinton over recent revelations that there were emails pertaining to Benghazi on her private email server. [“Today’s disclosure that 30 additional emails about Benghazi were discovered on Hillary Clinton’s private server raises additional questions about the more than 30, 000 emails she deleted,” stated Trump’s senior communications advisor Jason Miller. “Hillary Clinton swore before a federal court and told the American people she handed over all of her   emails. If Clinton did not consider emails about something as important as Benghazi to be   one has to wonder what is contained in the other emails she attempted to wipe from her server. ”  Miller’s statement comes after the Washington Examiner reports, “State Department attorneys said Tuesday the agency had discovered 30 emails among the records recovered from Hillary Clinton’s private server that discussed Benghazi. ” According to the report, the 30 emails about Benghazi were within the 15, 000 uncovered from Clinton’s private server by the FBI.
