During this week’s “Saturday Night Live” cold open, Alec Baldwin as   Donald Trump and Kate McKinnon as Trump senior adviser Kellyanne Conway took shots at the actual Trump for his “Thank You” tour and tweeting out “unpresidented” instead of “unprecedented. ”  Beck Bennett playing Vladimir Putin entered through the chimney dressed as Santa Claus, and John Goodman later came in as Trump Secretary of State pick Rex Tillerson. Bennett’s Putin got in a few Russian hacking references, even putting an Elf on the Shelf with a recorder on the mantle. “Tillerson” and “Putin” caught up and discussed business plans in Russia.
