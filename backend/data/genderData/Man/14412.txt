President Donald Trump revealed that the shooter who attacked the Congressional Republican baseball practice in Alexandria had died after he was shot by capitol police.  “Authorities are continuing to investigate the crime, and the assailant has now died from his injuries,” Trump said. The gunman was reportedly James T. Hodgkinson, a    Illinois man. Trump announced the news during a statement to the press at the White House where he praised the heroism of two Capitol police officers who were shot during the attack. “Many lives would have been lost if not for the heroic actions of the two Capitol Police officers who took down the gunman despite sustaining gunshot wounds during a very, very brutal assault,” Trump said. The president specifically recognized House Majority Whip Steve Scalise, who was wounded in the shooting, as a “patriot” and a “fighter. ” “Steve, I want you to know that you have the prayers not only of the entire city behind you, but of an entire nation and, frankly, the entire world,” he said. “America is praying for you. ” He also paid tribute to the congressional aides, the members of congress, as well as the first responders. “We may have our differences, but we do well in times like these to remember that everyone who serves in our nation’s Capitol is here because, above all, they love our country,” he said. Trump called for unity, and urged Americans to pray for the victims. “We can all agree that we are blessed to be Americans, that our children deserve to grow up in a nation of safety and peace, and that we are strongest when we are unified and when we work together for the common good,” he said.
