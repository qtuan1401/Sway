In an interview with New York radio host Charlamagne Tha God, boxing star Adrien Broner endorsed Republican Presidential candidate Donald Trump, saying, “Everything he’s saying is correct. ”[“He gon’ lower them taxes. And that’s what I’m with, for real, because taxes been kicking my ass,” the      world champion said on Wednesday.  At a record of 34 fights, 32 wins, and two losses, Broner has made many millions of dollars in just a few years. In 2014, the Ohio native began making celebrity   at night clubs, bagging $10, 000 per appearance. And last January, Broner turned a   $40 million deal from Jay Z’s Roc Nation Sports, noting that he’s worth more money and that he’s #AboutBillions. When asked if Donald Trump’s lack of policy knowledge or his bombastic remarks concern him, Broner said: “Man, I don’t care. Let that rich ni**a be president. ” “At the end of the day, the rich are going to get richer and the poor are going to stay poor,” Broner added. Ironically enough, Broner turned himself in to police in his hometown Cincinnati on Monday morning where he booked and released in connection with felony assault and aggravated robbery charges. If he is convicted, Broner would not be able to vote for the real estate developer. WATCH:  Follow Jerome Hudson on Twitter: @jeromeehudson
