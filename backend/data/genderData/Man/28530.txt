A tech    in Canada is inviting U. S. tech workers who fear a Donald Trump presidency to emigrate northwards and work for the company. [Sortable, an ad software company based in   Ontario, have conducted polling which shows that a large number of U. S. workers would consider moving to Canada if Trump were elected. In a post on their website, Sortable explained their findings.  31% of Americans would consider moving to Canada if Donald Trump was elected president, and for 15% of survey respondents, a move North isn’t completely off the table. This sentiment is strongest held amongst the younger age brackets, with 42% of   year olds saying they would move to Canada, compared to 20% of   year olds. The    blog post went on to invite any future refugees from a Trump presidency to apply for work at the company. Now, while we don’t think Americans will actually move en masse to Canada if the election doesn’t go their way, we do want to extend an offer. Because it’s the polite, Canadian thing to do. Sortable’s polling data is in line with previous reports of rising interest in emigration from the U. S. As Breitbart Tech previously reported, there was a massive spike in Google searches for “moving to Canada” following Donald Trump’s strong performance on Super Tuesday early last month. Vows to emigrate if one’s preferred candidate loses are, of course, commonplace in election years. Nevertheless, the level of animosity generated by Trump’s candidacy, as measured by his unfavourability ratings, are unprecedented. Should the businessman and reality TV star make it to the White House, it’s not hard to imagine some of America’s liberal tech workers following through on their hyperbolic pledges.
