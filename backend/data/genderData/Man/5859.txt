(Want to get this briefing by email? Here’s the  .) Good evening. Here’s the latest. 1. Wells Fargo, one of the nation’s biggest banks, will be fined $185 million for widespread illegal practices that targeted its own customers. Federal regulators said that employees opened fake accounts in clients’ names, issued credit cards without consent and charged people late fees on accounts they never even knew they had. Compensation policies that rewarded workers for drumming up new business may have prompted the fraud, officials said. _____ 2. “What is Aleppo?” was a question asked by Gary Johnson, the Libertarian Party presidential nominee, on an MSNBC morning show. His lack of knowledge about the   Syrian city prompted a torrent of criticism and saw the question become a trending topic on Twitter. Also heavily criticized on Thursday: Matt Lauer, over his handling of a   forum with Donald Trump and Hillary Clinton on Wednesday. “He performed like a soldier sent on a mission without ammunition,” wrote our TV critic. _____ 3. Mrs. Clinton attacked Mr. Trump for his remarks at the forum, including his assertion that Vladimir Putin, the Russian president, was a better leader than President Obama. She spoke in front of her campaign plane before leaving New York on Thursday, and again at a rally in North Carolina to register   voters. Mr. Trump was also criticized by lawmakers and military experts for defending his suggestion that the integration of women in the armed forces led to sexual assaults. On Thursday, he gave a speech about education in Ohio. _____ 4. Navy SEALs were unsuccessful in freeing an American and his Australian colleague from the Taliban in a raid in Afghanistan last month, officials said. Kevin King, an American university professor, and Timothy Weeks, the Australian, were taken at gunpoint on Aug. 7 from their vehicle near Darulaman Road in Kabul, above. President Obama personally authorized the raid, and officials said the SEALS are believed to have missed the men by hours. _____ 5. After lawsuits and complaints that Airbnb hosts can easily reject potential renters based on race, religion, gender, ethnicity, age or disability, the company announced several changes. It is instituting a new nondiscrimination policy, asking users to agree to a “community commitment” starting on Nov. 1, and planning to experiment with reducing the prominence of user photos. _____ 6. While states across the country have faced lawsuits over whether poor school districts are fairly funded, a judge’s decision in Connecticut went beyond the issue of money to essentially order an overhaul of the state’s education system. The current system “has left rich school districts to flourish and poor school districts to founder,” Judge Thomas Moukawsher said in the ruling. He has ordered the state to rethink nearly every major aspect of its public education. _____ 7. As the N. F. L. kicks off its season with a Super Bowl rematch between Denver and Carolina tonight (8:30 Eastern, NBC) players across the league are looking to rein in the power of its commissioner, Roger Goodell, above. He’s accused of being meddlesome and   with discipline, sidelining some of the game’s top stars and affecting the quality of play. Goodell and his deputies are unapologetic. One former N. F. L. player, Tim Tebow, is trying a different sport: He signed a minor league contract to play baseball with the Mets. _____ 8. In tennis, Serena Williams lost to Karolina Pliskova, ending her bid for the singles title at the U. S. Open. Caroline Wozniacki is pitted against Angelique Kerber in the other women’s semifinal ( ESPN). The American swimmer Ryan Lochte continues to be haunted by the troubles he had in Rio. He was given a   suspension for his drunken night out and the   story that resulted. _____ 9. It is Day 2 of New York Fashion Week. The city will host 279 shows and presentations over the next week, and about 54 percent of the audience at each will be made up of editors and members of the news media (here are more statistics about NYFW). Here’s a rundown of Day 1: Our fashion critic wasn’t terribly impressed with Kanye West’s show, above a lot of   showed up to Tom Ford’s first   collection, and another designer made his debut with garbage. Yes, garbage. _____ 10. Hungry? It may be all in your head, or at least caused by it  —   and exercise might be the key to diminishing those cravings. Researchers think that strenuous mental activity makes the brain sense it will soon need more calories, so it asks for food. But in a new study, college students who were given pizza after tackling exam questions ate less of it if they had exercised just after finishing the test. _____ 11. Lastly, we’ve been busy launching some new endeavors. Two of our writers, Wesley Morris and Jenna Wortham, above, introduced a new culture podcast called “Still Processing. ” In the first episode, they talk about Colin Kaepernick, Leslie Jones and the repercussions of public patriotism and dissent. We also published a detailed guide on how to meditate and, each morning, we’re putting out a briefing on stories that matter to Californians  —   and anyone else interested in the state.
