Sunday on NBC’s “Meet the Press,” host Chuck Todd said to Republican presidential candidate Donald Trump that if he goes after former President Bill Clinton’s sexual indiscretions while married to the Democratic   Hillary Clinton, then his “ugly” divorce will be on the table as well.  Partial Transcript as follows: TODD: You’ve said you’re willing to bring up Bill Clinton’s past with women if Hillary Clinton attacks you for being a sexist. So is that a threat to her? Is that essentially what you’re saying is, hey, you want know go down that road, you go down that road, I go down this road. TRUMP: I don’t want to say this is a threat but it’s a threat   …     of course, I can call her a nicer name. she was saying he has tendency towards being sexist   …     talking about me. She’s married to an abuser  —   a woman claimed rape, horrible things. ” TODD: You know if you bring it up people will bring up your  —   your first divorce was ugly  —   all over the tabloids. TRUMP: But I wasn’t the president of the United States and I wasn’t dealing in the Oval Office, all right? A big difference. I wasn’t the president. And my first wife thinks I’m great and my second wife and  —   and I have a great marriage. I mean, I have a great marriage. So  —   I mean, it’s fine. I’m not saying don’t bring anything up with me. But when she says that, I had to bring it up. And by the way, they’ve become very unresponsive since then.
