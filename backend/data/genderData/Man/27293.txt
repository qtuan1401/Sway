Tuesday on MSNBC’s “Morning Joe,” former Gov. Jeb Bush ( ) a candidate for the 2016 Republican nomination, discussed a report from The Washington Post that in a private meeting he had with Mitt Romney, the 2012 GOP nominee. In that meeting, Romney had reportedly said he thought Jeb Bush was “unfairly burdened” by his brother former President George W. Bush’s legacy.  Bush downplayed that critique, calling his brother “probably the most popular president” among Republicans and that he was honored to be a part of that family. “Look, Mitt Romney is a great guy and I do consider him a friend,” Bush said. “In that private conversation we talked about the campaign because he was thinking about running. I went out the see him. I wanted him to know that I was all in and that I had a plan to win this. And I still do. So my brother, if you did the polling and actually looked at it, he’s probably the most popular president amongst Republicans in this country. So the whole idea that somehow he’s a burden  —   any mistakes I make, they’re my own. My brother and my family, I’m honored to be part of that family. I love them dearly. And all the psychobabble that goes along with it, I’ve gotten over it. You guys can meditate on your navels about that. I’m not. ” Later in the segment, Bush was asked if he would like to see his brother take on Trump, to which Bush replied it was his job to do so. “I think that’s my job,” he replied. “I think that’s my job. You got to take on the bully head on and that’s what I’m doing. Everybody else is in the witness protection program, I’ve noticed. But look, you got to stand up for a guy  —   when he says the things he says and guarantees a conservative is not going to be elected president, that’s wrong. I’ve been a conservative all my adult life and that’s what I’m fighting for is to make sure the conservative cause is allowed to actually govern. And when we do, great things will happen for our country. ” Follow Jeff Poor on Twitter @jeff_poor
