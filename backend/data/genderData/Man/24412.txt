The Daily Beast’s Eleanor Clift argued Republican presidential candidate Donald Trump “has tapped into a vein of misogyny, and hate, and white supremacy” and Republicans have “been flirting with racial divisions way back to the days of the Southern Strategy” on Friday’s “McLaughlin Group. ”  Clift said, “He has tapped into a vein of misogyny, and hate, and white supremacy here, that makes a lot of people uncomfortable. But all these Republicans getting on their high horse, saying we can’t support someone who divides the country by race, they’ve been flirting with racial divisions way back to the days of the Southern Strategy, and on up. Trump is just doing explicitly what that  —   what the party has practiced implicitly, and now, it’s all coming apart. ” When asked by host John McLaughlin, “What’s this misogyny business?” Clift responded, “Misogyny is things he says about women. Things he says about refugees. ” After McLaughlin asked her to give examples, Clift stated, “You want me to repeat what he’s been saying? I prefer not to. ” McLaughlin then gave Clift permission, to which she responded, “No, I’d prefer not to. ” She added, “Wanting to ban all Muslims from entering the country, for example, is a good one. ” Follow Ian Hanchett on Twitter @IanHanchett
