’  ’ ’   Former House Speaker Newt Gingrich, a top ally to     Donald Trump, criticized the   magnate Tuesday for   baselessly tweeting over the weekend that ”millions of people”   voted ”illegally” in an election he won. ’ ’   In an interview  Gingrich said such a tweet   ”makes you wonder about whatever else he’’s doing.” ’ ’   ”The president of the United States can’’t randomly tweet without   having somebody check it out,” Gingrich said, later adding, ”It   undermines much more than a single tweet.” ’ ’   The former House speaker said later that Trump should not give up   tweeting, however. ’ ’   ”He should tweet, but he ought to have an editorial board     the first draft and sending it,” he suggested. ”But he   shouldn’’t give it up, and he shouldn’’t give up being Donald   Trump. He got elected being this unique, charismatic,   entrepreneurial guy who breaks lots of rules. . .. If he starts   getting to be normal, he’’ll cease being Donald J. Trump.” ’ ’’ ’   Top    by Trump in his tweets  —   California, Virginia, and New   Hampshire  —   called Trump’’s assertion that massive voter fraud   occurred in each ”unfounded” and ”unsubstantiated.” ’ ’   Gingrich also described a recent meeting he held with Trump,   saying the   told him that ”this is really a   bigger job than I thought.” ’ ’   ”Which is good,” Gingrich said. ”He should think that . .. you   have war and peace, you have enormous powers . .. and it all comes   down to the Oval Office and it all comes down to you.” ’
