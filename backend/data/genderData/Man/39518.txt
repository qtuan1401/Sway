(but) not in the face of an active attack on the country! Cyber war is real war,” he said. Jones criticized   Trump’s failure to categorically condemn Russian hacking. ”So you have an active attack on our country and the   cannot find it in himself to say this is wrong and it needs to stop?” Jones, exclaimed, aghast. ”Listen, he can respond personally to an attack,” he continued. ”He can respond as a partisan to an attack, but he can’t respond as a patriot to an attack? This is an attack on our country. ”Everybody sitting here, trying to pretend this is normal? It’s not normal and it’s dangerous,” Jones added.
