’  ’ ’   The reception for German Chancellor Angela Merkel at the White   House on Friday seemed less than warm. ’ ’   President Donald Trump sat next to Merkel   facing photographers and video cameras before their joint   press conference later Friday afternoon. When photographers asked   for a handshake, Merkel leaned over to Trump and seemed to ask   him if he wanted to do a handshake. ’ ”   Trump didn’t appear to respond to the question, and he didn’t   look over at Merkel as she leaned over to speak to him. It’s   unclear if it was a deliberate snub or if it was unintentional. ” ’   During his campaign, Trump accused Merkel of ”ruining   Germany” with liberal refugee policies, which some critics argue   could make countries more susceptible to terrorism. ’ ’   Before the awkward handshake interaction, Trump said to those   gathered in the room, ”Send a good picture back to Germany,   please, make sure.” He was asked how his talk with Merkel went,   and he replied, ”Good.” ’ ’   There are photos from earlier in the day showing Trump and Merkel   shaking hands. ’ ’   Watch the awkward interaction below: ’ ’ ’ ’The reception for German Chancellor Angela. ..’ ’’ ’’ ’’
