Speaker Paul D. Ryan treads a fine line between disavowing some of the Republican presidential nominee Donald J. Trump’s more inflammatory remarks and disavowing Mr. Trump himself. We mapped out Mr. Ryan’s rhetorical footwork: A statement from Donald Trump’s campaign on barring Muslim immigrants: “Donald J. Trump is calling for a total and complete shutdown of Muslims entering the United States until our country’s representatives can figure out what is going on. ” He added, “Until we are able to determine and understand this problem and the dangerous threat it poses, our country cannot be the victims of horrendous attacks by people that believe only in jihad, and have no sense of reason or respect for human life. ” Mr. Ryan: “This is not conservatism. What was proposed yesterday is not what this party stands for and, more importantly, it’s not what this country stands for. ” _____ Mr. Ryan, on endorsing Mr. Trump: “I’m just not ready to do that at this point. I’m not there right now. And I hope to, though, and I want to. ” _____ Mr. Ryan, on a   meeting with Mr. Trump: “It was important that we discussed our differences that we have. But it was also important that we discuss the core principles that tie us together. ” _____ Mr. Ryan on when he might give his endorsement:  “I don’t have a timeline in my mind, and I have not made a decision. Nothing has changed from that perspective, and we’re still having productive conversations. ” _____ Mr. Ryan endorses Mr. Trump: “Through these conversations, I feel confident he would help us turn the ideas in this agenda into laws to help improve people’s lives. That’s why I’ll be voting for him this fall. ” _____ Mr. Trump, on a judge of “Mexican heritage” presiding over Trump University cases:  “I’m building a wall. It’s an inherent conflict of interest. ” Mr. Ryan:  “I disavow these comments  —   I regret those comments that he made. Claiming a person can’t do their job because of their race is sort of like the textbook definition of a racist comment. ” But not retracting his endorsement: “I believe that we have more common ground on the policy issues of the day and we have more likelihood of getting our policies enacted with him than with her. ” _____ Mr. Ryan, addressing the Republican National Convention: “Only with Donald Trump and Mike Pence do we have a chance at a better way. ” _____ Mr. Trump, on Khizr Khan’s remarks that he has not sacrificed:  “I think I’ve made a lot of sacrifices. I work very, very hard. ” Mr. Trump, on Ghazala Khan: “If you look at his wife, she was standing there. She had nothing to say. She probably  —   maybe she wasn’t allowed to have anything to say. You tell me. ” Mr. Ryan’s spokeswoman, AshLee Strong, after Mr. Khan called on Mr. Ryan to repudiate Mr. Trump:  “The speaker has made clear many times that he rejects this idea, and himself has talked about how Muslim Americans have made the ultimate sacrifice for this country. ” _____ Mr. Ryan, in a statement, on honoring military sacrifice:  “America’s greatness is built on the principles of liberty and preserved by the men and women who wear the uniform to defend it. As I have said on numerous occasions, a religious test for entering our country is not reflective of these fundamental values. I reject it. Many Muslim Americans have served valiantly in our military, and made the ultimate sacrifice. Captain Khan was one such brave example. His sacrifice  —   and that of Khizr and Ghazala Khan  —   should always be honored. Period. ”
