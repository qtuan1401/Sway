MogIA, an artificial intelligence system that has correctly predicted the outcomes of the last three U. S. presidential elections, predicts that Donald Trump will become the next president of the United States. [“If Trump loses, it will defy the data trend for the first time in the last 12 years since Internet engagement began in full earnest,” said MogIA’s developer, Sanjiv Rai.  “If you look at the primaries, in the primaries, there were immense amount of negative conversations that happen with regards to Trump,” he continued. “However, when these conversations started picking up pace, in the final days, it meant a huge game opening for Trump and he won the Primaries with a good margin. ” MogIA has successfully predicted the last three elections in the U. S. since its creation in 2004, as well as both the Democratic and Republican primaries this year, and the system is constantly becoming more intelligent, according to its creator. Rai also states that Trump’s engagement on social media this year has overtaken that of Barack Obama’s in 2008 by 25%. “Granularity of data will determine progressively lesser bias despite the weightage of negative or positive conversations,” explained Rai, adding, “While most algorithms suffer from  ’s biases, MogIA aims at learning from her environment, developing her own rules at the policy layer and develop expert systems without discarding any data. ” Charlie Nash is a reporter for Breitbart Tech.
