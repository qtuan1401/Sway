’  ’ ”   Incoming Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer said Saturday   that he and Republican colleagues would call for a congressional   investigation into Russia’s reported involvement in the election. ” ’     ’ ’  ’ ’   ”Reports of the CIA’s conclusion that Russia actively sought to   help elect Donald Trump are simultaneously stunning and not   surprising, given Russia’s disdain for democracy and admiration   for autocracy,” Schumer said in a statement Saturday. ’ ’    ’ ’’ ’   ”That any country could be meddling in our elections should shake   both political parties to their core,” Schumer said. ”Senate   Democrats will join with our Republican colleagues next year to   demand a congressional investigation and hearings to get to the   bottom of this.” ’ ’   Schumer said it is ”imperative” for the intelligence   community to hand over any information that Congress would   find useful to its investigation. ’ ’   The CIA told senators in private meetings last week that their   evidence demonstrated it was ”quite clear” Russia aimed to   help Trump win. ’ ’  ’ ’  ’ ’   Trump has not personally responded, although he has spoken   out on other news since this surfaced. Early   Saturday, he dismissed as ”” a report by CNN and others that he would retain an     role on ”Celebrity Apprentice.” ’ ’   Sean Spicer, a communications director for the Republican   National Committee, stressed Saturday there was no proof   that any Russian involvement affected the outcome of the   election. ’ ’   ”Donald Trump doesn’t think  —   no one thinks that a foreign entity   should be interfering with the US election,” Spicer   told CNN’’s Michael Smerconish in a tense    on Saturday.  ’ ’   ”What proof does anyone have that they affected the outcome?   Because I’ve heard zero. Show me what facts that actually show   that anything undermined that election,” he added. ’ ’    ’
