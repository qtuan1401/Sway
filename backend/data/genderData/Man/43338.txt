’  ’ ’   WASHINGTON  —    made a   Thursday night appearance at the ”DeploraBall”   —   the     party organized by some of Donald Trump’’s more   prominent   supporters. ’ ’   While addressing the boisterous crowd from the stage, Clarke, who   is a registered Democrat and has run as a Democrat in each of his   elections as Milwaukee County sheriff, said the only way he’’d   reach across the aisle to work with liberal politicians would be   ”to grab one of them by the throat.” ’ ’   ”You may know me, you may not,” Clarke told the crowd. ”I am one   of those   fighters. When I hear people say we need to   reach across the aisle and work with the Democrats, you know what   I say? The only reason I’’ll be reaching across the aisle is to   grab one of them by the throat.” ’ ’   Following his speech, Clarke was asked by Business Insider why he   so viciously slammed Democrats when he runs as one. ’ ’  ’ ’’ ’   The bombastic sheriff also said during his speech that he   asked President Donald Trump during the campaign to put him ”in   the trenches.” ’ ’   ”I play smash mouth politics,” Clarke said. ”To this day the left   does not know what to do with me.” ’ ”   The sheriff, who is a frequent guest of cable news hosts,   particularly Fox News’ Sean Hannity, said he visited 39 states on   behalf of Trump during the campaign. ” ’   ”If you know the left like I do, if you know liberals like I do,   they never quit and defeat is not in their vocabulary,” he said,   making note of protesters who were throwing eggs at attendees of   the ”DeploraBall” as they entered the National Press Club in   Washington. ’ ’   Clarke was also asked by reporters after his speech if he was   offered a job with Trump. ’ ’   ”I have a job and it is as sheriff of Milwaukee County,” he   replied. ’
