Republican presidential nominee Donald Trump is gaining ground in Colorado and Maine on Hillary Clinton, according to polls released on the eve of the first presidential debate. [Statewide, Clinton leads Trump by only three percent, according to a Portland Press   Sunday Telegram poll, which has Clinton leading Trump 40 percent to 37 percent in a   matchup including Libertarian and Green Party candidates Gary Johnson and Jill Stein.  In Maine’s first congressional district, Clinton leads Trump 50 percent to 28 percent. But in Maine’s second congressional district, Trump leads Clinton 48 percent to 34 percent. Only 59 percent polled said they had “definitely” decided who they’re voting for as president. The poll’s margin of error statewide is plus or minus four percent. Clinton’s lead in Maine since the end of August has collapsed from 10 percentage points ahead of Trump to only three as the Republican candidate’s numbers surge. In the critical swing state of Colorado, Clinton is eking out a tiny lead of only one and a half percent over Trump in RealClearPolitic’s polling average in a   race, 40. 8 percent to 39. 3 percent. In a   matchup in Colorado, Clinton suffered a devastating crash from a 9. 6 percent lead over Trump on Sept. 11, the day she collapsed during New York City’s   memorial ceremony and had to be dragged into a van. She now leads Trump by a mere 1. 5 percent, 42. 3 percent to 40. 8 percent. In a CBS   poll with a margin of error of 4. 4 percent, Clinton leads Trump in a   race only 40 percent to 39 percent among 991 likely voters. A Washington   News poll found the two candidates locked in a virtual tie as the first debate approaches, while the L. A. Times Daily Tracking poll has Trump four points ahead of Clinton.
