Thursday in South Carolina at the Politico event on the economy and the election, Gene Sperling, the former director of the National Economic Council under Presidents Bill Clinton and Barack Obama, slammed Republican presidential candidate Donald Trump and declared he was “reaching the worst instincts in people. ”  Sperling said, “This is a person who is running a campaign that is appealing to the worst instincts in people. He has mocked a person with disabilities openly and then asked the person with disabilities to apologize for it. He has maligned Latino Americans calling them rapists. He has had the most   of religion position with Muslim. ” He added, “Bernie Sanders should not be mentioned in the same breath with him and either should Hillary Clinton. ” Follow Pam Key on Twitter @pamkeyNEN
