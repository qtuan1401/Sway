’  ’ ’   President Barack Obama bashed Donald Trump on Sunday for   misrepresenting his interaction with a Trump supporter at one of   his rallies. ’ ”   Obama was campaigning for Hillary Clinton in Fayetteville, North   Carolina, on Friday when an audience member began waving a Trump   sign, eliciting loud boos from the crowd. Obama  and reminded spectators of the man’s   freedom of speech. ” ’   Trump gave a strikingly different account of the incident    later that night, telling his supporters in   Hershey, Pennsylvania, that Obama was ”screaming” at the   protester and ”became unhinged.” ’ ”   Obama lampooned Trump’s version of the story at a rally in   Kissimmee, Florida. ” ’   He ”just made it up,” Obama said. ”Didn’’t just make it up but   said the exact opposite of what had happened. With impunity.” ’ ’   ”But that says something about how unacceptable behavior has   become normal, and that’’s why he is uniquely unqualified to hold   this job,” he added, to applause from the crowd. ’ ’   Obama said the way Trump framed the incident showed that ”our   values are at stake” on Election Day. ’ ’   ”The point is that he thought it was OK just to lie in front of   all his supporters, on television,” he said. ”Wasn’’t even trying   to be sneaky about it.” ’ ’   With two days before Election Day, the Clinton campaign has   deployed Obama to the key battleground states of Florida, North   Carolina, Michigan, and Ohio, hoping his popularity will raise   voter turnout. ’ ’ ’
