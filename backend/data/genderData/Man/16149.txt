Donald Trump leads Hillary Clinton by two points, 45 percent to 43 percent, in Sunday’s USC   Angeles Times “Daybreak” poll. [The New York real estate mogul has not led the former Secretary of State by two points since the beginning of August. Saturday was the first day the poll showed Trump pulling slightly ahead of Clinton since Aug. 3.  Sunday’s results come from 2, 385 voters, who are tracked daily through election day, Nov. 8. The USC   Angeles Times “Daybreak” poll tracks roughly 3, 000 voters each day, asking them who they plan to vote for in November. The data is averaged daily based on responses from the week prior, so results may lag somewhat following major campaign events.
