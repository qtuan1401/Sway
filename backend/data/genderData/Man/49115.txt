’   CNN on Sunday incorrectly reported that Donald Trump encouraged   his supporters to vote multiple times, then quietly amended its   online story when it became apparent the claim was not true. ’ ’   At the center of the story was a quote from Trump in which he   told supporters to vote. Consistent with his exaggerated claims   that Democrats are guilty of election fraud, the Republican   nominee said that ”in some places, they [vote] four or five   times, but we don’’t do that.” ’ ”   CNN appeared to misinterpret Trump’s quote and reported that   Trump encouraged his own supporters to vote several times. The   story was later edited to reflect what Trump actually said, but   did not include an editor’s note. ” ’   The website Mediaite,  captured   screen grabs of the original CNN story and tweet: ’ ’  ’ ’  ’ ”   Only after Mediaite’s report did CNN insert an editor’s note   explaining to readers the changes that were made. ” ’   Matt Dornic, vice president of communications at CNN, told   Business Insider in an email that ”a correction note should have   been added immediately.” ’ ’   ”Our policy states that corrections must be accompanied by an   editor’’s note disclosing the change,” he said. ’ ’   Trump has repeatedly criticized CNN throughout the election   cycle, asserting that its coverage favors his rival, Hillary   Clinton, and is biased against him. ’
