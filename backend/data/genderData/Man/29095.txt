Omar Mateen’s second wife knew he was planning an attack, according to a report in People Magazine. [Salman told police that she was aware her husband had been “scouting Downtown Disney and Pulse [nightclub] for attacks. Unlike the four Disney World theme parks, Downtown Disney, which was recently renamed Disney Springs, doesn’t have security and bag check before entry,” a federal law enforcement source told the publication.  Mateen and Salman married in 2013 after a short marriage to his now   Sitora Yusufiy. The marriage lasted from 2009 to 2011. If correct, the admission of knowledge about the pending attack bolsters comments by GOP candidate Donald Trump that Muslims in America don’t do enough to warn cops about pending jihad attacks. Before the “San Bernardino [attack in December 2015] people knew what was going on, they knew exactly, but they used the excuse of racial profiling for not reporting it,” Trump said Monday, according to The Huffington Post. “These people need to have consequences, big consequences. ” I thought people weren’t celebrating? They were cheering all over, even this savage from Orlando. I was right. https:  .   —   Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) June 13, 2016,
