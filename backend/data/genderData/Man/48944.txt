’  ’ ’   Michael Cohen, an attorney for Republican presidential nominee   Donald Trump, implied on Tuesday that the more than a dozen women   accusing Trump of various forms of sexual misconduct were not   attractive enough to grope. ’ ’   ”Beauty is in the eye of beholder . .. these aren’’t even women   he’’d be attracted to,” Cohen said in a CNN interview with Wolf   Blitzer. ’ ”   That line follows a recurring argument of Trump’s on the campaign   trail  —   that some of the women who have accused him of groping,   kissing, and manhandling them were not attractive and therefore   are not telling the truth. ” ’   ”Look at her  —   look at her words,” the Manhattan businessman    in West Palm Beach, Florida, last week. ”I   don’’t think so.” ’ ’   Cohen, who described himself as a registered Democrat, attempted   to give credence to the ”beauty” argument: ”I think what Mr.   Trump is really trying to say is that they’’re not somebody that   he would be attracted to, and therefore, the whole thing is   nonsense.” ’ ’   Cohen also said, however, that regarding the beauty argument, ”I   don’’t think it’’s relevant to the conversation at all.” ’ ’ ’ ’Michael Cohen says Trump was saying accusers are ”not someone he would be attracted to” so that makes the claims ”nonsense” ’ ’   Earlier on Tuesday, People magazine said  who say they can   corroborate allegations against Trump levied by journalist   Natasha Stoynoff. Stoynoff  accusing Trump   of physically attacking her in 2005. Her story was published   after the release of a recording from the same year in which   Trump bragged about groping women. ’ ”   Amid continued media scrutiny over the accusations against Trump,   his campaign and his surrogates have amplified their claims that   the election, by way of national media outlets and publications,    in favor of Trump’s Democratic counterpart,   Hillary Clinton. ”
