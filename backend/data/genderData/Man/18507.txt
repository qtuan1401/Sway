Eric Schmidt, the executive chairman of Alphabet, Google’s parent company, offered a presidential campaign plan to Cheryl Mills, one of Hillary Clinton’s closest aides, as far back as 2014. [“I have put together my thoughts on the campaign ideas and I have scheduled some meetings in the next few weeks for veterans of the campaign to tell me how to make these ideas better,” Schmidt wrote to Mills all the way back in 2014.  Some of Schmidt’s ideas included the assembling of a sizeable campaign structure after the 2014 midterm elections, setting up a large campaign headquarters outside of Washington, D. C. as well as the need to connect with voters using digital media and social networks. It was also revealed this week that Eric Schmidt wanted to be the “head outside advisor” to the Clinton campaign, with Clinton campaign chairman John Podesta adding that he was “ready to fund, advise, and recruit talent” for the Clinton campaign. WikiLeaks founder Julian Assange has also claimed that Google is “directly engaged” in the Clinton campaign. The collusion between Schmidt and the Democratic Party is just further evidence of the shocking level of   bias in Silicon Valley. Other examples include Facebook   Dustin Moskovitz pledging over $35 million to Hillary Clinton in order to defeat Donald Trump, whilst Apple CEO Tim Cook and Microsoft founder Bill Gates were both touted as possible vice presidential picks by Hillary Clinton.
