’  ’ ”   A CIA analyst has resigned, citing concerns over President Donald   Trump’s treatment of the US intelligence community. Edward Price,   who had worked for the CIA since 2006, left his position this   month. ” ’   ”I cannot in good faith serve this administration as an   intelligence professional,” Price said in a column  on Monday. ’ ”   In his column, Price expressed his disbelief with the manner in   which Trump  —   both as a candidate and as    —      over its findings   about Russia’s attempts to influence the US election. ” ’   Trump on several occasions accused US spy agencies of conducting   politically motivated investigations, and at times called out   specific agencies like the CIA in tweets railing against their   actions. ’ ’   Price pointed to one specific occasion  the day after he was inaugurated: ’ ’’ ’   Price insisted his decision to resign was not political, having   served ”with conviction,” he wrote, under President George W.   Bush. Price said Trump’’s decision to add White House chief   strategist Steve Bannon to the National Security Council’’s   Principals’’ Committee also contributed to his decision to leave   the CIA. Bannon is seen by critics as a champion of     politics. ’ ’   Price urged the Trump administration to rebuild trust with the US   intelligence community by acknowledging their contributions that   inform public policy. ’ ’A CIA analyst has resigned, citing concerns. ..’ ’’ ’’ ’’
