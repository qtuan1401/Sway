Thursday on MSNBC’s “Morning Joe,” filmmaker and liberal Rob Reiner accused hosts Joe Scarborough and Mika Brzezinski of not asking the presumptive Republican presidential nominee Donald Trump hard questions.  During that exchange, Reiner said the media has not scrutinized Trump because  “the words that have flung out from his mouth are insane. ” “If he was not a celebrity  —   if Donald Trump was not a celebrity   …     the words that come out of his mouth, you’d see a guy in a park, a lunatic on a soapbox in the park, and you’d walk right by him,” he continued. “But the fact that he is a celebrity all of a sudden we are all interested. ” When asked to explain the millions who vote for Trump, Reiner said, “There are a lot of people who are racist. ” Scarborough pushed back, “Oh, my God  —   did you just say that?   …     So you think people that vote for Donald Trump are racists?” Reiner said, “They’re not all. I said there are A lot of people who are. There’s racism in this country that’s been submerged for a long, long time and all of a sudden there’s a man  …    he’s unearthed a lot of it. ” Follow Pam Key on Twitter @pamkeyNEN
