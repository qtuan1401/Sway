GOP frontrunner Donald Trump took to Twitter on Tuesday afternoon to give advice to Sen. Bernie Sanders ( ) who is running against Hillary Clinton for the Democratic Party nomination. [Bernie Sanders has been treated terribly by the Democrats —  both with delegates  otherwise. He should show them, and run as an Independent!  —   Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) April 26, 2016,   Sanders’ wife, Jane Sanders, later responded to Trump’s advice during an interview on CNN with Wolf Blitzer. “We’ve been very clear right from the beginning that we will not play the role of spoiler,” Sanders stated, dismissing Trump’s advice. “The reason that he was active and he decided to run in the Democratic Party was just that: We cannot afford a Republican in the White House. We cannot afford a Republican appointing Supreme Court justices. So Bernie will not be running as an independent. ”
