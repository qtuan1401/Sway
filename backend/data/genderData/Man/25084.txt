Sunday on ABC’s “This Week,” FiveThirtyEight’s Nate Silver said Democratic presidential nominee Hillary Clinton was one state away from losing the election.  Silver said, “We show a   lead nationally for Clinton,   favorite. The electoral college map is less solid for Clinton than it was for Obama four years ago, where four years ago we had Obama ahead in states totaling 320 some electoral votes. Clinton has 270 so one state away from potentially losing the Electoral College. Rather be in her shoes than Donald Trump, but it’s not a terribly safe position. ” (  The Hill) Follow Pam Key on Twitter @pamkeyNEN
