Other Facts:Economy   Arabia possesses approximately 22% of the world’s oil reserves. It is the world’s largest exporter of petroleum liquids and relies on the oil industry for almost half of its GDP. Saudi Arabia was a founding member of OPEC (Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries) in 1960.  More than 30% of Saudi Arabia’s population is made up of foreign workers.  Foreign Relations   the end of World War II, Saudi Arabia and the United States have maintained a relationship based on an exchange of oil for security. Their mutual interests have included the free flow of oil, and fighting the spread of communism and extremist groups such as al Qaeda and ISIS. Saudi Arabia and the United States have not agreed on support for Israel or engagement with Saudi Arabia’s regional rival, Iran. Saudi Arabia was a founding member of the Arab League in 1945.  It currently maintains close ties with its neighbor, Bahrain, and helped the Sunni monarchy there put down an Arab Spring uprising in 2011.  Saudi Arabia was a longtime supporter of Egyptian leader Hosni Mubarak before his overthrow in 2011. It did not support the successor government of Mohamed Morsy and the Muslim Brotherhood. After Morsy’s overthrow in 2013, Saudi Arabia returned its support to new president Abdel Fattah  .  After many years of strained relations, Saudi Arabia began constructing a fortified fence along its   border with Yemen in 2003. This is in response to the ongoing unrest in Yemen due to Shiite Houthi rebels and terrorist group al Qaeda in the Arabian Peninsula.  It has also started work on a   barrier along the border with Iraq, to prevent border incursions by the terrorist group ISIS.  Religion   The Wahhabi, or Salafi, branch of Sunni Islam has been closely tied to the Saud family since the 18th century. When the Saud family established the modern country of Saudi Arabia in the 1930s, the Wahhabi interpretation of Islam become the country’s official   religion.  One of the five pillars of Islam is performing Hajj, by traveling to Mecca, Saudi Arabia, at least once. Approximately two million people a year make the pilgrimage.  Saudi Arabia bans public worship by   and severely restricts public displays of religion by   sect Muslims, including Shiites.  Women’s Rights   Saudi Arabia has a guardianship system based on strict Wahhabi interpretation of Islam. The system is not a formal law. Under the guardianship system, women in Saudi Arabia are prohibited from driving. In November 2014, King Abdullah’s advisory council recommended easing the ban. It is still under consideration. Under the guardianship system, women also cannot open bank accounts, work, travel or go to school without the express permission of a male guardian. In 2011, King Abdullah announced that women will be allowed to nominate candidates for the next set of municipal elections. In December 2015, women were allowed to vote for the first time, 979 women ran for office, and 17 were elected.
