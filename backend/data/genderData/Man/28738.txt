On May 31, presumptive Republican presidential candidate Donald Trump weighed in on Katie Couric’s “fraudulent editing,” tweeting that she “should be ashamed” of herself. [Katie Couric’s gun control film  —   Under the Gun  —   contains an   pause that was inserted in the editing process. That pause gives viewers the false impression that   proponents were unsure or stumped when Couric questioned them about gun control. Breitbart News previously reported that NPR called the edits “unfair and unwarranted” and made clear it never would have inserted the pause in the film because its journalistic standards are higher than those of Couric.  Now Trump is calling out Couric over the edits, tweeting that she “should be ashamed” and suggesting that she is “third rate,” at best, anyway. Trump tweeted: Katie Couric, the third rate reporter, who has been largely forgotten, should be ashamed of herself for the fraudulent editing of her doc. Katie Couric, the third rate reporter, who has been largely forgotten, should be ashamed of herself for the fraudulent editing of her doc.  —   Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) May 31, 2016,  In addition to the   pause, Breitbart News previously reported that Couric’s people interviewed gun scholar John Lott for four hours for the film but left the entire interview on the cutting room floor. Director Stephanie Soechtig told The Guardian they cut Lott because they decided to reserve time in the film for those they consider to be “responsible gun owners. ” AWR Hawkins is the Second Amendment columnist for Breitbart News and political analyst for Armed American Radio.
