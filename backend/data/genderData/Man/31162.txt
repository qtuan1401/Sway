Tuesday in West Bend, WI at a campaign rally, Republican presidential nominee Donald Trump said, “We reject the bigotry of Hillary Clinton. ”  Trump said, “We reject bigotry of Hillary Clinton which panders to and talks down to communities of color and sees them only as votes   —  that’s all they care about  —   not as individual human beings worthy of a better future. They have  taken advantage. She doesn’t care at all about hurting people of this country or the suffering she has caused them, and she meaning she and her party officials. There has been tremendous suffering because of what they have brought. The   community has been taken for granted for decades by the Democratic Party and look how they’re doing. ”
