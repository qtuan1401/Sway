’  ’ ”   Long before Donald Trump bashed China during Monday’s   presidential debate, the Republican nominee was already quite   famous in China. ” ’   Chinese people see Trump as an ”internet celebrity” on social   media, a phrase used to describe people who gained popularity   online by behaving in outlandish ways, and who oftentimes would   not be taken seriously. ’ ’   As Trump announced his candidacy last year, Chinese people   immediately gave him several nicknames, which all sound funny   with a disrespectful tone in Mandarin, mostly because, at the   time, they believed Trump was just a joke and had no chance of   winning White House. ’ ’   ” ” transliterated from ”Trump,” is an abbreviation of   ”Sichuan Putonghua.” The phrase literally means ”Mandarin with a   Sichuan accent,” which is usually used to mock someone from   Sichuan Province who may not speak standard Mandarin and have   some accented pronunciation. ’ ’   This supposedly mocking nickname has been adopted by many     news agencies outside mainland China,   including . ’ ’  ’ ’   ” ” also sounds similar to ”Trump,” and literally means   ”breaking bed.” ’ ’   The two nicknames above serve as first names, and the last name   Chinese people give to Trump is ”Tang,” which sounds similar to   ”Don. ”Because Chinese usually take what appears first as a   surname, when they see ”Donald Trump,” they would naturally take   ”Donald” as a last name and ”Trump” as a first name. ’ ’   Also, ”Tang” is a real surname that thousands of Chinese people   are using, so it makes ”  ” or ”  ” sound   more like a real name  —   except that few people would name   themselves after either ”Sichuan Putonghua” or ”breaking bed.” ’ ”   The last one is the official translation of Donald Trump, adopted   by  and Chinese mainstream media. The translation has   no special meaning in it. And internet users normally don’t use   such a formal name to refer to Trump on social media. ”
