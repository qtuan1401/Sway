’  ’ ’     Former New York City Mayor Michael Bloomberg will  Hillary Clinton     during a primetime speech at the Democratic National Convention     Wednesday night.   ’ ’     While Bloomberg has made it known he is against Donald Trump’s     candidacy, so much so that he  potentially splitting     the vote and enabling a Trump presidency as the primary reason     he chose not to launch an independent White House bid of his     own, the appearance at the DNC comes as a surprise in that     Bloomberg left the party in 2000. He ran for mayor as a     Republican and later registered as an independent.   ’ ’     Here’s more on the move :   ’ ’     Howard Wolfson, a Bloomberg adviser, told the Times     that the endorsement has been several weeks in the making and     the former mayor was enticed by the offer to give an address     that reflected his political beliefs, rather than strict     Democratic Party doctrine. Bloomberg is scheduled to appear on     Wednesday evening along with President Obama and Vice President     Biden.   ’
