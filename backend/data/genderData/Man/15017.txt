We said hello when a bunch of anarchist thugs began to descend on us screaming ‘hey Chachi are u fascist? ’” Gasparino explained. “One made an aggressive move toward us i shoved him away and he said ‘touch me again u little prick and I’ll smack u’ my response: ‘GFY asshole’ that’s when my producer Brian Schwartz intervened and crisis was averted. ” Baio has been silent on the matter. The    actor endorsed Trump last March in an interview with Fox News’ Judge Jeanine Pirro, and later spoke to support him at the Republican National Convention in Cleveland.
