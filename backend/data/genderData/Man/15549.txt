Retired Navy SEAL and former Blackwater CEO Erik Prince offered his insights on former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton’s close personal aide Huma Abedin on Thursday’s edition of Breitbart News Daily on SiriusXM. [“Huma Abedin, the person closest to Hillary Clinton in the world, connected to the Muslim Brotherhood, edited a journal with radical Islamic thought in it. Her family, she comes from a bizarre background  —   well, it’s not really bizarre, it’s kinda commonplace in the Muslim world. Talk to us about the Abedins,” Breitbart    Alex Marlow said Prince.  “Her parents, particularly her father, was very much a Muslim Brotherhood sympathizer or agent, originally from India,” Prince replied.  “The Muslim Brotherhood approach is a slow, creeping infiltration and takeover, with sharia law, so having an agent of influence very sympathetic to the Muslim Brotherhood, sitting right at the ear of Hillary Clinton for all these years, these decades, and then potentially in the White House, is absolutely unacceptable,” he warned. “She’d have a very difficult time passing any actual quality security background check on agents of influence,” Prince said. “It’s extremely troubling, and it’s amazing for Hillary, that purports herself to be a feminist and a great supporter of women’s rights, to at the same time have an adviser whose own view of the world is so  . ” He supported this assertion by describing the Muslim Brotherhood as “a paradigm that subjugates women, that believes it’s acceptable to murder and execute gays, female genital mutilation  —   just the list of awful things that we, in the West, consider barbaric and horrid to just talk about, it is central to their way of thinking. ” “And here she is, chirping in Hillary’s ear all these years,” he said of Huma Abedin.
