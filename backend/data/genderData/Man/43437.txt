’  ’ ”   Top Trump adviser Kellyanne Conway took to Twitter on Saturday to   praise the president’s executive actions halting refugee   admission to the United States.  ” ’   ”Get used to it. @POTUS is a man of action and impact,” Conway      along with a link to a Fox News segment in which she talked   about how Trump followed through on his campaign promise to   implement ”extreme vetting” of refugees and migrants from certain   countries.  ’ ’    ’ ’   ”Promises made, promises kept,” her tweet continued. ”Shock to   the system. And he’’s just getting started.” ’ ’   Donald Trump signed  that banned refugees   from entering the US for 120 days. Syrians have been banned   indefinitely, and   from six     countries  —   Sudan, Iraq, Iran, Libya, Somalia, and Yemen  —   have   been barred entry for at least the next three months. ’ ’’ ”   Critics of Trump’s refugee ban say it is discriminatory and   violates the Constitution’s religious freedom guarantees. ” ’   ” ’ ’  ’ ’  ’
