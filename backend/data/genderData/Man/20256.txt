[He’s urging the country to remember the 2, 403 Americans killed and the 1, 178 Americans who were wounded.  “Their shared sacrifice reminds us of the great costs paid by those who came before us to secure the liberties we enjoy, and inspires us to rise to meet the new challenges that stand before us today,” Trump said. He recalled Reagan’s use of the quote of Gen. Douglas MacArthur reminding Americans that “there is no substitute for victory” in war. “Today we are the bearers of the torch of freedom these brave Americans passed on to us,” he said. “In honor of their faithfulness, and for the sake of generations to come, we will never allow that flame to be extinguished. ”
