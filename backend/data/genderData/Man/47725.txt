’  ’ ’   Newt Gingrich said Thursday night in the aftermath of the    that the US should issue a   religious test to Muslims in the country and deport those who are   found to believe in Sharia Law. ’ ’   The former House speaker’s comments came on Fox News when host   Sean Hannity asked, “What does this tragedy, this evil attack   tonight, mean for that conflict and debate?” ’ ’   “Western civilization is in a war,” Gingrich said. “We should   frankly test every person here who is of a Muslim background, and   if they believe in Sharia, they should be deported. Sharia is   incompatible with Western civilization. Modern Muslims who have   given up Sharia, glad to have them as citizens. Perfectly happy   to have them next door. ” ’ ’ ’ ’   He added: ”Anybody who goes on a website favoring ISIS, or Al   Qaeda, or other terrorist groups, that should be a felony, and   they should go to jail. Any organization which hosts such a   website should be engaged in a felony. It should be closed down   immediately. ” ’ ’   The First Amendment to the US Constitution protects against “an   establishment of religion, prohibiting the free exercise   thereof. ” ’ ’   Gingrich, who was thought to be one of Donald Trump’s top picks   for vice president, said he was “sick and tired of being told   that the wealthiest, most powerful civilization in history, all   of Western civilization, is helpless in the face of a group of   medieval barbarians. ” ’ ’   “We’re told to be reasonable, to be passive, to not judge,” he   said. “Well I just want to tell you tonight, everybody who   watches this video, this is the fault of Western elites who lack   the guts to do what is right, to do what is necessary, and to   tell us the truth, and that starts with Barack Obama. ” ’ ’   At the end of Gingrich’’s lengthy statement, Hannity replied:   ”That’’s a powerful statement. I agree wholeheartedly.” ’ ’   The attack in Nice, France, Thursday left at least 80 dead and   more than 100 wounded. ’
