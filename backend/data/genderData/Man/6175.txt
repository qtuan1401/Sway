PHOENIX  —   Donald J. Trump won Arizona’s presidential contest and its 11 electoral votes on Thursday after the latest count put him over the top, extending a long Republican winning streak in the conservative state. Mr. Trump had a solid lead over Hillary Clinton on Election Day, but a winner was not declared because there were so many uncounted votes  —   over 600, 000. The latest batch of returns tabulated on Thursday made him the clear winner. It marks a   winning streak for Republican presidential candidates in Arizona. Bill Clinton was the last Democrat to take the state, in 1996. Before him, Harry S. Truman was the last Democrat to win here. Mrs. Clinton was closer to gaining Arizona than President Obama, who lost by nine or more percentage points during his two runs for president. She was losing by four points. Arizona was one of three races that had yet to be determined from Tuesday’s election, with Michigan and New Hampshire still too close to call. Mr. Trump made several swings through Arizona and capitalized on Republicans’ dislike of Mrs. Clinton and their frustration over illegal immigration, vowing to build a wall along the border. Sheriff Joe Arpaio and former Gov. Jan Brewer were some of his most vocal backers, especially on immigration issues. Gov. Doug Ducey was among those who introduced him at rallies and urged Arizonans to vote for him. Mrs. Clinton sought to tap into frustrations among Latinos over Mr. Trump’s   talk and a favorable ballot that included a   increase and Mr. Arpaio’s bid for a seventh term as sheriff of Maricopa County, which includes Phoenix. Many Hispanics reviled the sheriff over his immigration raids. Paul Penzone, a Democrat, beat the longtime sheriff handily.
