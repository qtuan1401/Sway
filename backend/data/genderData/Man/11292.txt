While not naming Trump directly, the pontiff called for building bridges and not walls, adding that it was not Christian to ask someone else to pay for it. [The statements b Pope Francis were made during his weekly general audience where he called for Christians to build bridges instead of raising walls and to overcome evil with good, The Guardian reported.   In February 2016, various news outlets reported that Pope Francis had stated that Trump was not a Christian over his desire to build a border wall. At the time, Trump denounced the statements and their apparent effort to influence the election. According to the Daily Mail, the Pope’s spokesman then walked back the statements, claiming that it was not a personal attack but the Pope was simply referring to his beliefs about helping immigrants and building bridges instead of walls. At the time, the Pope’s spokesman said that the pontiff had spoken only based on what he had been told about Trump. Ildefonso Ortiz is an award winning journalist with Breitbart Texas.
