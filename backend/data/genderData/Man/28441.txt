RNC Chairman Reince Priebus is praising Donald Trump’s selection of Indiana Gov. Mike Pence for his running mate, calling the pair the “America First ticket. ”[“Governor Mike Pence is a strong addition to the ticket. Governor Pence is an experienced public servant and a solid conservative whose policies have led to the longest period of uninterrupted job growth in Indiana’s history,” Priebus said in a statement.  This is a   America First ticket, whose wealth of knowledge and experience will get   families thriving again. Their winning ideas are in stark contrast to Hillary Clinton, whose plans are merely more of the failed Obama policies which have sent debt skyrocketing and paychecks slumping. Our ticket’s robust vision for prosperity and security makes it clear that the Republican Party is the only party prepared to lead an American turnaround. Similarly, the Republican Party of Iowa Chair, Jeff Kaufmann, released the following statement: “Governor Pence is a proven conservative leader,” Kaufmann wrote. He has been an outstanding Governor for the state of Indiana and was a successful member of Congress. As a fellow   Governor Pence understands many of the problems that everyday Iowans experience and will be a strong asset to Donald Trump to bring   solutions to Washington, D. C. Both Trump and Pence will campaign together on Saturday in New Jersey.
