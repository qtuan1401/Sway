GOP presidential candidates former Arkansas Gov. Mike Huckabee and former Pennsylvania Sen. Rick Santorum, who are participating in the earlier GOP debate on Thursday, say they want to attend GOP frontrunner Donald Trump’s event on Thursday night for veterans rather than the primetime GOP debate hosted by Fox News. [Huckabee was asked if he would attend, and the former Baptist minister admitted, “We’ve put in a call to [Trump’s] people and said that I’d be delighted to come. ”  Huckabee, who hasn’t heard back, said, “If they say that they would be happy to have me, I’ll be there. ” Santorum also expressed interest in Trump’s event, saying, “After the debate, I’m not going to be doing anything, so, I guess, if it’s a charitable thing for the troops and he invites other people to come, I certainly would attend to support the troops. ” Santorum has not yet received a formal invitation to join. Both Santorum and Huckabee showed willingness to join Trump at Drake University for the event during an interview on The Laura Ingraham Show. 2:30 EST   Santorum is now going too, according to the New York Times.
