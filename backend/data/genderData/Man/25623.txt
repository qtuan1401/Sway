GOP frontrunner Donald Trump defended Sen. Jeff Sessions ( ) against an attack from the National Review and touted that he, himself,  has more congressional endorsements than Sen. Ted Cruz ( ). [Conservative radio host Howie Carr of The Howie Carr Show told Trump that a National Review writer called Sessions, who recently endorsed Trump, a prostitute. “Wow! That’s terrible,” Trump responded to Carr’s news.  “Well, Sessions is highly respected. To have his endorsement, was such an honor,” he added, saying Sessions is “the best on the borders, the best judicially, and having him was fantastic. ” Trump added that it’s “incredible” Cruz has no Senate endorsements. On the National Review, Trump charged, “It’s failing. It’s going out of business, and they are nasty people. ” “They’re wrong on so many different things,” he added.
