Enigmatic pop icon Cher took to Twitter Monday to rip presumptive GOP presidential nominee Donald Trump  —   as she has done repeatedly in the past  —   by suggesting that terrorists around the world would be emboldened under a Trump administration.

IF UR SCARED OF TERRORISTS NOW, WAIT 4PRES TRUMP,” she added. The singer continued her recent practice of adding a toilet emoji to every instance of Trump’s name. Most of Cher’s tweeting these days appears to center on Trump, whom she apparently despises despite calling him a “giant” among his Republican rivals last October. (For comparison, the singer called Ted Cruz a “creature from the nether regions” a couple of years ago.) “TRUMPS LIPS MOVE=LIES,” the singer tweeted in a separate message on Monday, adding the obligatory toilet emoji. 🚽TRUMPS LIPS MOVE=LIES “LET EVERY1 HAVE NUKES”“LET WORLD FIGHT ITS OWN BATTLES“GO  KILL ALL OF ISIS CHILDREN”,NO, NEVER SAID THOSE THINGS,  —   Cher (@cher) June 14, 2016,  Monday was a particularly busy day on Twitter for the   as she repeatedly hammered Trump in her distinctive style.
