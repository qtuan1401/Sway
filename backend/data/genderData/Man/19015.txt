Florida deputies found graffiti that said, “Kill white people” and “Black Lives Matter”   on a wall facing a busy road. [Deputies from the Hillsborough County Sheriff’s Office painted over the phrases, but have no idea who did the damage, WFTS reported.  Cat D’Alessandro, who saw the vandalism and helped deputies cover it up with her own spray paint, was appalled at the hate message displayed on the road. “It’s uncalled for, there’s a way to protest, there’s a way not to, this is just, it hurts everybody,” D’Alessandro said to WFTS. A trailer was also hit with similar graffiti messages ten minutes away from the vandalism on Gornto Lake Road in Brandon. The Trump sign in the front yard was also vandalized. “Yeah I’m pissed off, very pissed, because this just ruined our paint job and it makes our neighborhood look like trash now,” Stacy Hatfield, a resident of the neighborhood, said to WFTS. Hatfield said its wrong to graffiti a house based on who the owner wants to vote for. “Vandalism, they got nerve to come and do that,” she said. “We didn’t know we was discriminating anybody,” but “obviously we offended somebody,” she added. D’Alessandro is saddened by the amount of hate displayed in the graffiti and hopes it does not happen again. “It makes me sad that it’s gotten to this much hate when we really should love and care about each other,” she said.
