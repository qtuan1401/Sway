  Donald Trump receives formal intelligence briefings at least three times a week, according to his transition team. [Republican National Committee (RNC) Chief Strategist and Communications Director Sean Spicer told reporters on Wednesday that Trump meets each day with his national security adviser, retired United States Army Lt. Gen. Michael Flynn.  “Every single day, he’s getting a briefing,” Spicer stated. “Three times a week” he receives the President’s Daily Brief, which ABC News calls “the   intelligence document produced in the United States. ” On Sunday, Trump told Fox News that he didn’t need to hear intelligence briefings daily if the information had not changed. “I get it when I need it,” Trump stated. “I’m, like, a smart person  …    I don’t have to be told the same thing in the same words every single day for the next eight years. ” The questions about Trump’s intelligence briefings come after Reuters reported on Friday that Trump only receives one intelligence briefing per week.
