In addition to the many millions of dollars in cash and stock Mr. Cohn received from Goldman Sachs that made up the lion’s share of his personal assets, he held a slew of positions in publicly traded stocks  —   many of which he has already said he plans to sell  —   and in various private entities. Those entities include a stake valued at more than $1 million in a consumer education and consulting business called Payoff, a position in a cosmetics retailer also valued at more than $1 million, investments in several   concerns in Ohio valued at $100, 000 or more each, and an investment in a venture capital fund run by Andreessen Horowitz, the Silicon Valley powerhouse, valued at $100, 000 or more.  —   Kate Kelly Mr. Bannon may be one of the best known figures in the Trump White House, but as the Trump administration goes, he’s probably not one of the wealthiest.

A PNC custodial account owned by Ms. Hahn is valued at $500, 000 to $1 million. And various stock funds listed on her financial disclosure are worth as much as $1. 5 million.

At his daily briefing on Friday, the White House press secretary Sean Spicer tried to put the best spin on the vast wealth that would be on display Friday night: The White House disclosures fit an   pattern in Washington of dumping mountains of documents on Fridays, when normal people have left work and are beginning to enjoy their weekend.
