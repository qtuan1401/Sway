Wednesday on CNN’s “New Day,” while discussing the controversy over Republican presidential nominee Donald Trump raising concerns in the Trump University case over U. S. District Court Judge Gonzalo Curiel’s Mexican heritage, Sen. Susan Collins ( ) said Republican presumptive presidential nominee Donald Trump needs to “own up to making a mistake” and “apologize to the judge and to the American people. ”  Collins said, “Well, first of all, I would love to be able to endorse Donald Trump, but he really has to change the approach that he has taken. If I were giving him advice, I would tell him he should own up to making a mistake. He should apologize to the judge and to the American people. And he should stop insulting people and groups of people. He is the one who needs to start acting more presidential and articulate clearly what a Trump presidency would look like.  So, frankly, I really think the burden is on him to put forward a far more positive message. ” Follow Pam Key on Twitter @pamkeyNEN
