Sunday on ABC’s “This Week,” “News One Now” host Roland Martin said Republican presidential   Donald Trump was a result of the GOP inviting “evil” and now it is taking over.  Martin said, “This is their problem. They invited evil in and now evil is taking over, OK.   …     The night of Obama’s inauguration, ‘We will stop him at every turn.’ They love the Tea Party anger. They took advantage of it in ’10, ’12, ’14. They said, we can control it and harness it. Now all of a sudden, Trump is taking advantage of it. The Republican establishment has to say, we played with fire. now it’s about to consume us. they have to accept some blame. ” Follow Pam Key on Twitter @pamkeyNEN
