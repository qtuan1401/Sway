The Presidential Inaugural Committee announced Friday that 8, 000 marchers from 40 bands and equestrian units accepted invitations for the parade after   Donald J. Trump and Vice   Michael R. Pence are sworn in at the Capitol on January 20. [“People from every corner of the country have expressed great interest in   Trump’s inauguration and look forward to continuing a salute to our republic that spans more than two centuries,” said Sara Armstrong, CEO of the Presidential Inaugural Committee.  “As participants follow in the footsteps of our new president and vice president down Pennsylvania Avenue, they will be adding their names to the long list of Americans who have honored our country by marching in the inaugural parade,” Armstrong said. In addition to the Border Patrol Pipes and Drums Corps, parade participants include high school and university marching bands, equestrian corps, first responders, and veterans groups, she said. Trump and Pence will be sworn in on the West Front of the United States Capitol. Joining them will be their families, members of Congress, the U. S. Supreme Court, Diplomatic Corps and other distinguished invited guests. The day before the January 20 transfer of power, a   ceremony at Arlington National Cemetery will take place, followed by  a concert by the Lincoln Memorial.
