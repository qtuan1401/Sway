’  ’ ’   President Trump appears to be getting impatient with the   infighting between his closest advisers.  ’ ’   The White House is becoming increasingly split between Steve   Bannon, who favors a more nationalist approach to domestic and   foreign policy, and Jared Kushner and senior economic adviser   Gary Cohn, both of whom have tried to bring the president   toward the center on key issues such as immigration   reform.  ’ ’      ’ ’   Tensions between the two camps had been simmering for some   time, and finally boiled over in the last week as a  engulfed the West   Wing. That included rumors of a staff   Bannon’’s removal   from the National Security Council, and  that Bannon called Kushner a ”cuck” and a ”globalist”   behind his back while the latter was on a trip to   Iraq.   ’ ’   Trump’’s order to his staff came on the heels of Bannon’’s removal   from the NSC, after which allies said Bannon had gone ”full honey   badger.” That’’s in reference to the motto of Breitbart News,   which Bannon once spearheaded: ”Honey badger don’’t give a    .” ’ ’’ ’   Nevertheless, Bannon, Kushner, Ivanka Trump, and Priebus met on   Friday, the day after the president ordered them to   work together. The meeting was ”100% focused” on pushing the   president’’s agenda forward, a source told Axios. ’ ’   And though Bannon, a hardline isolationist, had argued against US   intervention in Syria, his allies said on Saturday that incoming   domestic policies would be more aligned with his views.   Conversely, allies of Kushner and Cohn have said that the   president will put forth an agenda that favors more centrist   policies on key issues. ’ ’President Trump appears to be getting impatient. ..’ ’’ ’’ ’’
