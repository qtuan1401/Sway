’  ’ ”   Donald Trump’s Walk of Fame star in Hollywood was quickly   destroyed, and now it’s quickly being repaired. ” ’   A man identifying himself as Jamie Otis on Wednesday used a     and a sledgehammer to  which he   got for his show ”The Apprentice.” Otis said he’’d hoped to remove   the star and sell it to raise funds for women who have accused   Trump of sexual assault. ’ ’   A suspect in the destruction who may or may not be Otis . ’ ’   Now the Hollywood Chamber of Commerce is immediately fixing the   broken star, a process that will cost between $3, 000 and   $10, 000, . ’ ’   ”It’’s mostly the cost of the labor,” Leron Gubler, the president   and CEO of the Hollywood Chamber of Commerce, told ABC News. ”The   stars are composed of the brass symbols and the terrazzo is   concrete with marble chips, so it’’s a process. It takes quite a   bit of work  —   several hours worth. It’’ll take several days to   season before they can polish and restore it.” ’ ’   Gubler noted that only one other Walk of Fame star ever has been   destoyed in a similar manner, one for the composer Carmen Dragon.   He also said the Trump star will not be removed. ’ ’   ”Once a star is installed it becomes part of the historic fabric   of the Walk of Fame. We have never removed a star in the     history of the Walk of Fame,” he said. ’ ’   A tweet that went viral said, ”While you call Latinos ’’rapists   and murders [sic]’’ here’’s a #Latino repairing your star.” (It is   not clear if the man in the picture is in fact Latino.) ’ ’ ’ ’ ’t’t’tWhile you call Latinos ”rapists and murders” here’’s a  repairing your star.   ’
