Wikileaks’ Julian Assange said that the organisation plans to release a “lot more” leaked material on Hillary Clinton and the Democratic Party in the run up to November’s presidential election. [Assange, who is still currently hiding from extradition in the Ecuadorian embassy in London, told CNN that the leaks are “having so much political impact in the United States” after Wikileaks released 19, 000 classified emails from the Democratic National Committee.  The emails revealed tactics used by the DNC to derail Bernie Sanders’ campaign for the Democratic nomination. The findings have increased tensions at the Democratic National Convention this week as Hilary Clinton receives the nomination, with many Sanders even walking out in protest. Leaked   of DNC show plans to destroy Bernie Sanders. Mock his heritage and much more.   from Wikileakes, really vicious. RIGGED,  —   Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) July 23, 2016,  “What we have right now is the Hillary Clinton campaign using a speculative allegation about hacks that have occurred in the past to try and divert attention from our emails, another separate issue that WikiLeaks has published,” Assange said. “I think this raises a very serious question, which is that the natural instincts of Hillary Clinton and the people around her, that when confronted with a serious domestic political scandal, that she tries to blame the Russians, blame the Chinese, etc,” he continued. “If she does that when she’s in government, that’s a political, managerial style that can lead to conflict. ” Assange refused to confirm whether Russia was behind the hack, saying that Wikileaks likes “to create maximum ambiguity as to who our sources are. ” You can follow Ben Kew on Facebook, on Twitter at @ben_kew, or email him at ben@yiannopoulos. net.
