During Sunday’s Democratic presidential debate on NBC, Sen. Bernie Sanders ( ) argued he would be the best candidate of he and his opponent Hillary Clinton to take on Republican presidential   Donald Trump.  Sanders cited his rise from   in the polls to now being ahead of Clinton in polls. “As Secretary Clinton well knows, when this campaign began, she was 50 points ahead of me,” Sanders said. “We were all of 3 percentage points. Guess what, in Iowa, New Hampshire  —   the race is very, very close. Maybe we’re ahead in New Hampshire. In terms of polling, guess what we’re running ahead of Secretary Clinton in terms of taking on my good friend Donald Trump. ” Follow Jeff Poor on Twitter @jeff_poor
