’  ’ ’   Obviously,  has been a disaster for Donald   Trump and the Republican party. But the situation is even worse   for Republicans than it looks at first glance. ’ ’   Downballot Republicans face a grim choice: Repudiate   Trump and annoy the great many Republican base voters who   are big fans of his, or stick with Trump and alienate swing   voters (while also  down the toilet.) ’ ’   An ”undervote” is the term for when a voter casts a ballot but   does not vote in a particular race. As some Republicans stick by   Trump and others reject him, the party is at grave risk   of triggering what I’’ll call the triple undervote. ’ ’   When you combine those three effects, the result is that   Democrats can win up and down the ballot even if most of the   voters in a given state or district lean Republican. ’ ”   It’s a total nightmare for Republicans. And it’s a reason   rejecting Trump en masse may not help the   party protect its House and Senate majorities. ”
