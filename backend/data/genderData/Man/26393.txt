Likely Republican nominee Donald Trump responded to Speaker of the House Paul Ryan’s statement earlier Thursday that he’s “not ready” to support Trump. [“I am not ready to support Speaker Ryan’s agenda,” Trump said in an emailed statement. “Perhaps in the future we can work together and come to an agreement about what is best for the American people. They have been treated so badly for so long that it is about time for politicians to put them first!”  Trump’s comment mirrored Ryan’s earlier statement. “I’m just not ready to do that at this point. I’m not there right now,” Ryan said earlier on Thursday during an appearance on CNN about whether or not he’ll support Trump.
