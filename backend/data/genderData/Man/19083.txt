Sunday on CBS’s “Face The Nation,” Rep. Keith Ellison ( ) a candidate for the Democratic National Committee chair, said   Donald Trump was “not draining the swamp. ” Instead he claimed that he was “filling it up more and there’s going to be more swamp creatures than ever before. ”  Ellison said, “Well Donald Trump is already proven where he’s going with the thing. There was a political article entitled “Why Wall Street is suddenly in love with Donald Trump” He’s not draining the swamp. He’s filling it up more and there’s going to be more swamp creatures than ever before. I mean, he is  …     lobbyists and   investment bankers, he’s not doing what he said he with was going to do for average, working Americans. We have to be there to work with all those folks who may have not voted or even voted for him. They are our natural constituents. But we have to show them that we really care about them, that we respected their voice, and that we are going to be fighting for them tooth and nail. ” (  RCP Video) Follow Pam Key On Twitter @pamkeyNEN
