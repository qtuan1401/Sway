Friday on Fox Business Network’s “Varney  Company,” Milwaukee County, Wisc. Sheriff David Clarke said Democratic presidential nominee Hillary Clinton “will not get the volume of black voters that Barack Obama did and even her husband. ”  Clark said, “Look, black people are as diverse as any other demographic in the United States. They’re beginning to open their eyes to this monolithic voting for Democrats, especially a presidential time. Barack Obama was an aberration, a lot different than she is. Even her husband was more connected, mostly to black people, than she ever will be. She’s a   pony. Only thing she can play, the one word that comes to mind when I think of her, is sinister. He added, “I’m not putting a seismic shift back to Donald Trump. He made the appeal and that hasn’t happened. He went and talked to black people with respect. He understands that we can think our way through this thing and made it clear, give him a chance. Take a look around the American ghetto. Things have not gotten better. Look, she’ll get a high number of blacks because there will be a lag time between the time of his message and it takes effect. But she’s not going to draw the numbers. Think volume, not percentage. She will not get the volume of black voters that Barack Obama did and even her husband. ” Follow Pam Key on Twitter @pamkeyNEN
