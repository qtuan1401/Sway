During a June 15 speech in Atlanta presumptive Republican presidential candidate Donald Trump explained that concealed carry could have stopped or at least lessened the number of dead in the Pulse Orlando attack. [He explained that the Orlando nightclub was a   zone, saying it “was full of innocent people and you had no guns on the other side. ”  Trump said, “By the way, I’m going to save your Second Amendment. ” And once the applause subsided he added: If some of those great people that were in that club that night had guns strapped to their waist or strapped to their ankle —  and if bullets were going in the other direction, aimed at that guy [for whom this was just] target practice —  you would have had a situation which would have [been] horrible, but nothing like the carnage that we as a people suffered this weekend. Trump continued by pointing to France and talking about how the   concert venue ended with 130 persons shot dead on November 13, 2015.  Eight days after that attack Trump told George Stephanopoulos that an armed citizenry could have prevented the “horror show” in Paris.
