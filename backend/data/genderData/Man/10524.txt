Stores were closed, thousands of police were deployed and some residents were to be temporarily evicted from their homes, amid unprecedented security arrangements for US President Donald Trump’s walk through the Old City of Jerusalem on Monday afternoon. [Trump, due to arrive in Israel Monday for a   visit, is set to walk some 350 meters from Jaffa Gate to the Church of the Holy Sepulchre for a visit at 3:00 p. m. Monday.
