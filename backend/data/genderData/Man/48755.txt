’   Renowned statistician Nate Silver said on Sunday that a new poll   showing Libertarian nominee Gary Johnson with 24% support in his   home state of New Mexico made the chances of an Electoral College   deadlock ”plausible.” ’ ’   Silver wrote  that Johnson had a 2% or 3%   chance of winning the Land of Enchantment. If that were to   happen, and Trump and Clinton were to split on key swing states,   neither of the candidates could reach the necessary 270 electoral   votes needed to secure the presidency. ’ ’ ’ ’ ’t’t’tA new poll puts  at 24% in New Mexico, which makes this map plausible. Electoral College deadlock.   ’ ’   In such a scenario, the election would be thrown to the House of   Representatives, which would determine the fate of the election. ’ ’   Silver did caution that while it’’s ”plausible,” it’’s unlikely   that such a scenario would play out. ’ ’   ”It’’s not   to think the Electoral College would be   close enough that New Mexico would make the difference, and it’’s   not totally crazy to think that Johnson could win his home   state,” he wrote. ’ ’’ ’   Silver added: ”But for both to occur together is quite a parlay.   In 20, 000 simulations of our   model this morning, cases   in which neither Clinton nor Trump received a majority of   electoral votes and Johnson received at least one came up just 30   times, putting the chances at 0. 15%.” ’
