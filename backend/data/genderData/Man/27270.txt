Sunday on NBC’s “Meet the Press,” while discussing the controversy over a supposed registry of Muslim immigrants,   Donlad Trump’s incoming White House chief of staff Reince Priebus said, “We’re not going to have a registry based on a religion. ”  When asked if he could, “equivocally rule out a registry for Muslims?” Priebus replied, “Look, I’m not going to rule out anything. I wouldn’t  —   we’re not going to have a registry based on a religion. What I think what we’re trying to do is say there are some people  —   certainly not all people, Chuck  —   here are some people that are radicalized. And there are some people that have to be prevented from coming into this country. ” “President Trump’s position is consistent with bills in the House and Senate that say the following: If you come  —   if you want to come from a place or an area around the world that harbors and trains terrorists, we have to suspend that operation until a better vetting system is put in place,” he continued. “When that happens, when the better vetting system is put in place, then the radical folks  —   they will not be allowed in, but then others will be allowed in. But only until that is done. That’s what General Michael Flynn believes. That’s what President Trump believes. ” Follow Pam Key on Twitter @pamkeyNEN
