’  ’ ’   In 2013, Donald Trump repeatedly urged President Barack Obama   against taking action in Syria in retaliation for a chemical   weapons attack carried out by the regime of Bashar     warning that it would ”bring nothing but trouble” for the US. ’ ’   But President Trump, who recently said that he likes to be   ”flexible,” changed course this week when he  on Shayrat airfield and nearby Syrian   military infrastructure in response to a chemical attack   that killed at least 80 people in northwestern Syria on   Tuesday. ’ ”   White House press secretary Sean Spicer addressed reporters   wondering about Trump’s evolution in thought on Friday,   explaining that Trump was moved by footage of Syrians, including   children, dying of symptoms related to nerve   agent poisoning. ” ’   ”He was very moved and found the event extremely tragic, so I   think from the get go it was very very disturbing and tragic and   moving to him,” Spicer said. ’ ’   Spicer outlined the timeline for the   process. He   said Trump asked for more information on the chemical   weapons attack on Tuesday morning and was presented with military   options during a   meeting of National Security   Council deputies. The NSC principals met on Wednesday afternoon   and discussed three options for a response. ’ ’’ ’   Trump then met with Defense Secretary Jim Mattis, Secretary of   State Rex Tillerson, and National Security Adviser H. R. McMaster   and decided to act. ’ ’   Trump made a statement after the strike and noted that ”even   beautiful babies were cruelly murdered in this very barbaric   attack.” ’ ’   ”No child of God should ever suffer such horror,” he said. ’ ’   Earlier this week, Trump said that the attack had changed his   calculus on Syria and Assad. ’ ’   ”That attack on children yesterday had a big impact on me. Big   impact,” Trump said. ”That was a horrible, horrible thing. And   I’’ve been watching it and seeing it and it doesn’’t get any worse   than that.” ’ ’   But Tillerson was careful to portray the strike as a carefully   calculated move rather than an emotional reaction on behalf of   the president. Spicer said at the Friday press briefing that   Trump was presented with several different options earlier this   week and considered each with his national security team before   deciding on the strike. ’ ’   ”I do not view it as an emotional reaction at all,” Tillerson   . He said Trump decided that the US   ”could not yet again turn away, turn a blind eye” after Obama’’s   inaction in 2013. ’ ’   Despite Trump’’s ”America First” campaign rhetoric and his 2013   warnings to Obama, Trump hesitates to ever appear weak, and   Assad’’s attack on Tuesday violates a deal struck under the Obama   administration in which Assad agreed to remove his stockpile of   chemical weapons. ’ ”   Assad  in recent   years, but this week’s attack was the most egregious since the   2013 agreement. ” ”   Jared Kushner, a senior adviser to Trump, reportedly also had a   hand in Trump’s decision. New York Magazine    that Kushner argued that Trump needed to push the Assad regime. ” ”   Trump’s decision to strike  and his chief   strategist, Steve Bannon, was reportedly arguing against it.   The New York Magazine report noted that Trump going   against Bannon’s opinion seems to suggest his waning influence in   the White House. ” ’   It’’s so far unclear where Trump goes from here. Tillerson on   Thursday cautioned against interpreting the strike as ”a change   in our policy or posture relative to our military activities in   Syria today.” And Trump has not yet said whether he wants to take   action to remove Assad from power. ’ ’   Fred Hof, the director of the Atlantic Council’’s Rafik Hariri   Center for the Middle East and former US special adviser on   Syria, told Business Insider that the strike would ”either be a          retaliation for a heinous   chemical weapons assault on civilians, or it will serve as a   signal to the Assad regime and its allies that the free ride for   mass murder in Syria is now over.” ’ ’In 2013, Donald Trump repeatedly urged. ..’ ’’ ’’ ’’
