’  ’ ”   Donald Trump will not formally invite a woman who former   President Bill Clinton admitted to having an affair with decades   ago to this week’s presidential debate, his campaign manager said   on Sunday. ” ’  ’ ’   But in an interview on ”State of the Union,” Trump campaign   manager Kellyanne Conway said the Trump campaign had not   formally invited Flowers to the debate in Long Island, New York,   and mocked the Clinton campaign for being ”baited” into   responding to Trump’’s threat. ’ ’   ”Basically, Mr. Trump was saying look, if Mark Cuban is   going to send out these texts saying ’’The Humbling at   Hofstra,’’ and ’’This is his big downfall,’’ then Mr. Trump was   putting them on notice that we can certainly invite guests that   make it into the head of Hillary Clinton,” Conway said. ’ ’   She added: ”But we have not invited her formally, and we don’’t   expect her to be there as a guest of the Trump campaign.” ’ ”   Clinton’s campaign  for inviting Flowers, with   whom former President Bill  ” ’   ”Hillary Clinton plans on using the debate to discuss the issues   that make a difference in people’’s lives. It’’s not surprising   that Donald Trump has chosen a different path,” Clinton   Communications Director Jennifer Palmieri said in a   statement. ’ ”   Flowers, who is supporting Trump, previously  that she would be at the debate,   though it was unclear whether she had received a formal   invitation or was simply responding to Trump’s tweet. ” ”   For his part, Cuban has proved deft at getting under Trump’s   skin. ” ”   After Trump slammed the Dallas Mavericks owner and threatened to   invite Flowers to Monday’s debate, Cuban fired back with   background information on a private call between the two   outspoken businessmen. ” ’ ’ ’ ’t’t’tDonald.
