Pollster and analyst Pat Caddell told Breitbart News Daily SiriusXM host Alex Marlow on Friday, based upon polling   and internal data, “We’ve got about ten to twelve percent of the people who seem to still be in flux, in movement, and the interesting things is, when you tend to look at those people   …     the issue structure still tends to favor Trump. ”[“There’s much more volatility in the race than a lot of the mainstream media and so forth are saying. So I think that’s important to point out,” added Caddell.  Most importantly, Caddell made the point repeatedly, using various data points, that the election is not over, as many mainstream media outlets seems determined to make it appear.
