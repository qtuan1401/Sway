During the interview, Scheiner recalled warmly his letter of fitness for Obama, when he was a candidate for president, describing him as a man who was youthful and built of “solid muscle. ” He also ridiculed Trump’s letter from his doctor promoting him as “the healthiest individual ever elected to the presidency” and suggested that the billionaire appeared overweight. Although Scheiner said he had “misgivings” about Clinton as president, he preferred her immensely to the idea of Trump as president. “He scares the devil out of me,” he said.
