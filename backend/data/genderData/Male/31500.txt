The latest polling data from Maine’s second congressional district has Donald Trump and Hillary Clinton in a statistical tie, exactly a week before the 2016 presidential election. [The latest Emerson poll has Clinton leading Trump by two points, or 44 percent to Trump’s 42 percent, whilst Libertarian Gary Johnson and the Green Party’s Jill Stein are at six percent and two percent respectively.  Meanwhile, a Maine People’s Resource Center (MPRC) poll has Trump leading Clinton by three points, or 41 percent compared to Clinton’s 38 percent, whilst Johnson and Stein trail behind at eight percent and three percent. Trump last campaigned in Maine in   where more than twenty parked cars were vandalised outside his rally. Maine and Nebraska are the only two states that do not allocate presidential electors on a    statewide basis. Maine splits its votes by congressional district: the winner of the first district wins three electoral votes and the winner of the second wins one electoral vote.  The data is further good news for the Trump campaign, who today woke up to the news that Trump had a lead on Clinton for the first time in an ABC   Post tracking poll, which has generally shown significant leads for Hillary Clinton.
