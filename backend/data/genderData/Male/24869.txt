The mainstream press reported late this week on a federal court’s ruling in a case involving Republican poll monitors in Pennsylvania. [U. S. Judge Gerald Pappert, a 2014 Barack Obama nominee, blocked the Pennsylvania Republican Party’s lawsuit challenging a law forbidding poll monitors from leaving their own county to watch the polls. Poll monitors now must stay in their own counties, even though some State Senate and congressional districts have polling places that require people to leave their county to vote.  This is not the major blowback to Donald Trump that the press is claiming. Trump poll monitors in Pennsylvania will just have to coordinate closer this weekend to make sure that they have each county locked down. Following a meeting with Border Patrol in which he learned that U. S. government officials were rushing illegal immigrants through the border to vote in the presidential election, Trump put out a call on Twitter and on his website for monitors, Across the country, people are signing up: @realDonaldTrump letting you know I signed up at my precinct to be a voting Talley monitor. Can’t wear #Trump shirt 300 ft from poll site.  —   Kimberly D Holder (@KimberlyDHolder) August 24, 2016,  @IngrahamAngle Laura I’m glad the Haiti issue has come to lite Clintons are sleaze bags and I’ve signed up to be a Trump poll monitor,  —   Dennis Griffin (@hombre57036950) October 21, 2016,
