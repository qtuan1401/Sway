From Philip Rucker writing at The Washington Post:  West Virginia looks perfect for Donald Trump: a struggling   state filled with the types of voters who have backed him elsewhere and could deliver one of his biggest victories. But a sweep there might not matter. That’s because as many as 34 delegates  —   the entire contingent  —   may be free to back whomever they want at the Republican National Convention. Much the same is true in Pennsylvania, home to a hotly contested April 26 primary, where there are 54 uncommitted delegates. Other states and territories, from Colorado to Wyoming to Guam, will also send squads of unbound representatives. These are the swing voters of the GOP nominating contest, nearly 200 activists and elected leaders beholden to nothing except their personal judgment and empowered to make or break candidacies. If Trump arrives at the July convention in Cleveland just shy of the 1, 237 delegates required to secure the nomination outright, these unbound delegates could decide to push him over the top  —   or force a contested convention with successive rounds of balloting.
