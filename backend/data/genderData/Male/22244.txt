Monday on ABC’s  “The View”   Joy Behar said in her opinion Republican presidential   Donald Trump is “the most dangerous man alive right now. ”  Behar said, “Sarah Palin is one of the people he would take advice from. The other thing about him, he says things that are so dangerous, seriously. He’s talking about giving South Korea a nuclear bomb. he wants South Korea and Japan  …    This is the most dangerous man alive right now, in my opinion. It’s like, weren’t you around  —   didn’t you read your history books? You don’t want nuclear proliferation. you want fewer, fewer, not more nuclear weapons. ” Follow Pam Key on Twitter @pamkeyNEN
