Ben Howe, a leader of the dwindling   #NeverTrump group of moderate bloggers, pundits, and political consultants on the right, mocked the defenseless woman in San Jose whom protesters pelted with bottles, eggs, and food on Thursday night. [And all she did was try to make America great again.  https:  .   —   Ben Howe (@BenHowe) June 3, 2016,   Howe, who is a RedState contributing editor, has been leading the growingly embarrassing   #NeverTrump movement of moderate “movement conservative” political consultants, pundits, and bloggers upset over Trump’s victory in the Republican primary. When he received backlash over his mocking of the woman covered in egg yolks thanks to   protesters, he aimed to draw a moral equivalence between a woman being pelted with bottles and eggs and a reporter who had her arm grabbed while chasing a presidential candidate. These tweets are identical to what we said about Michelle Fields. But no. She deserved it. Right? https:  .   —   Ben Howe (@BenHowe) June 3, 2016, Then he tried to blame Donald Trump for the attack and claimed that throwing rocks and bottles are no worse than a glitterbomb or a Halloween prank. I don’t condone violence. But to pretend Trumpists  Trump himself haven’t cultivated a   of hatred  paranoia is delusional.  —   Ben Howe (@BenHowe) June 3, 2016, @ToniMZ81 no, and I’ve condemned the violence. I just don’t consider egging to be more than glitter bombing. @Jacobnbc,  —   Ben Howe (@BenHowe) June 3, 2016, Plenty of unacceptable violence last night. But I’m sorry. I refuse to think of egging (a Halloween prank) as violence against women.  —   Ben Howe (@BenHowe) June 3, 2016, Howe eventually admitted that maybe he had let his anger get the best of him and immediately claimed his moral superiority over “Trumpists” for his “introspection. ” This is called introspection. Something Trumpists are incapable of. NEVER do it at their demand. Only if it’s real. https:  .   —   Ben Howe (@BenHowe) June 3, 2016, Now Howe is trying to paint himself as the victim by retweeting all the mean things people on the internet said to him.
