President Barack Obama suggested at a New York fundraiser that American society is sexist, which is why Hillary Clinton is struggling to beat Donald Trump in the polls. [“There’s a reason why we haven’t had a woman president —  that we as a society still grapple with what it means to see powerful women,” Obama said during a speech on Saturday evening. “And it still troubles us in a lot of ways, unfairly, and that expresses itself in all sorts of ways. ”  Obama pointed out that the presidential election will be close, but that it should not be, and he took time to defend Clinton’s qualifications to serve as president. “She’s been in the room where it happens, repeatedly,” Obama said. “And her judgment has been unerring, and she has been disciplined, and she has been extraordinarily effective in every job that she’s had. ” Obama also resumed his attack on conservative media, blaming them for polarizing American political society. He said: If all you’re doing is watching Fox News, and listening to Rush Limbaugh, and reading some of the blogs that are churning out a lot of misinformation on a regular basis, then it’s very hard for you to think that you’re going to vote for somebody who you’ve been told is taking the country in the wrong direction. Obama again said that Donald Trump was not qualified to be president, unlike his vanquished election rivals Sen. John McCain and Mitt Romney. “He shows no interest in even gaining the rudimentary knowledge required to make really hard decisions on a    basis,” Obama said. “There’s no curiosity. There’s no desire to get up to speed. It’s an infomercial. It’s a reality show. ”
