’  ’ ’   Since the end of the Democratic National Convention, Hillary   Clinton has been riding high in the polls nationally, in swing   states, and in a few places that should give Republicans cause   for real alarm. ’ ’   One of those places is Georgia, a state that hasn’t voted for a   Democratic presidential candidate since 1992. ’ ’   After months of a slim Trump lead in the state, two recent polls   show Clinton ahead. ’ ’   The latest, a  poll of likely   voters, shows Clinton up by a remarkable 7 percentage points. ’ ’   Although  in   FiveThirtyEight’s pollster rankings,   FiveThirtyEight’s own   forecasting model   suggests that a Clinton lead in Georgia could very well be real;   it currently gives her a  chance of winning   the state. ’ ’     Clinton likely owes much of her current standing in the state’s     polls to a highly successful convention and a highly damaging     couple of weeks for Donald Trump. But there’s also reason to     believe that deep changes in Georgia’s demographics are     boosting her support and could turn Georgia purple soon, if not     this November.   ’ ’       The changes that have taken place in Georgia mirror the kinds       of changes that have put into play other formerly solid       Republican states in the South, like Virginia and North       Carolina. As with these states, Georgia’ population has been       growing and diversifying.     ’ ’       In 2000, roughly 63 percent of Georgians were .  an estimated 54 percent       are, the result of a Latino population that has grown from       roughly 5 percent to more than 9 percent, a black population       that has grown from 29 percent to 31 percent, and an Asian       population that has grown from roughly 2 percent to 4       percent.     ’ ’       These numbers are driven, as is also the case in the new       swing states, by a changing economy. Urban centers like       Atlanta and the industries based in them like tech and health       care are growing, which is  migration to       Georgia not just from abroad, but also from elsewhere in the       country.     ’ ’       According to the Census Bureau, Georgia was one of the top 10        for Americans       moving to another state between 2010 and 2015.     ’ ’  ’ ’       These factors motivated a significant investment of resources       by Democrats in Georgia’s 2014 Senate race. Michelle Nunn, a       nonprofit executive and daughter of former Georgia Sen. Sam       Nunn, was thought to have a  at beating then —  Republican       candidate David Perdue. Her chances were contingent on Nunn       turning out Latino and black voters, including some of the       700, 000 black Georgians who were eligible to vote but       unregistered at the time.     ’ ’       This seemed like a real possibility. The trajectory of voter       registrations since 2000 suggested as much —   new       nonwhite voters registered between 2000 and 2014 compared       with just over 111, 000 new white voters —  and in 2014, Stacey       Abrams, Georgia’s house minority leader, launched  an ambitious effort       to register minorities. But in the end, Nunn  to Perdue roughly 53       percent to 45 percent.     ’ ’       “Nunn’s main problem in 2014 was simple: turnout,       particularly turnout among the Democratic base,” says Tharon       Johnson, a veteran Democratic strategist in Georgia. “She did       not do enough to motivate that base nor did she do enough to       appeal to the hundreds of thousands of historically white       Democratic voters who have not voted for a Democrat statewide       since 2002. ”     ’ ’       Indeed, Nunn won 26 percent of the white vote, short of the              her campaign estimated she would need to have a real chance       of winning. Her loss in 2014 and the returns from 2012, in       which Obama lost Georgia by roughly the same margin and did        with white Georgians       than any Democratic candidate since 1972, show that whites       still must constitute a sizable part of any Democratic       coalition statewide, despite Georgia’s changing electoral       base.     ’ ’  ’ ’       Given Trump’s significant lead over Clinton with white voters       nationally and given the economic  of the         white voters in industrial sections of Georgia       outside the state’s growth centers, one might expect Trump       both to sweep the white voters Clinton would need and to       register many new ones.     ’ ’       As Nate Cohn  in 2014, it is often       forgotten that there are actually far more unregistered but       eligible white voters than there are unregistered but       eligible nonwhites.     ’ ’       But the latest polling from Georgia suggests that Clinton is       already doing better with white Georgians than Obama did in       either 2008 or 2012 and better than John Kerry did back in       2004 ’ ’tlanta         released on Friday       shows she’s losing Georgia whites by 37 percentage points.       That would seem abysmal        that Obama lost white Georgians by 60 points in  and by 54 points in       . Kerry also lost       whites by 54 points in 2004. ’ ’       It’s still unclear why Clinton seems to be doing relatively       well with white Georgians, but if these numbers hold and if       minorities turn out in droves, Clinton could have a very real       shot at winning the state.     ’ ’       Those are still big ifs. The state’s  might       well suppress minority turnout, and at the moment Clinton       isn’t even within striking distance of the Nunn campaign’s 30       percent target for white voters.     ’ ’       The Atlanta   poll shows       that Clinton currently has the support of 23 percent of       Georgia’s white voters in a straight    with Trump       and 20 percent of them with   candidates Gary       Johnson and Jill Stein included. Charles Bullock, a political       science professor at the University of Georgia who’s       monitored the state’s politics for decades, thinks that       difference is important.     ’ ’       “She’s going to have to count on libertarians siphoning off a       share of the white vote,” he says. “And that could happen.       Although polls this far out show   candidates doing       better than they actually do on election day. ”     ’ ’         Just  the Clinton         campaign told Georgia Democrats it would be hiring more         field organizers in the state, and the New Georgia Project         announced it has registered 70, 000 new minority voters this         year. These are both signs that Democratic organizing         efforts in Georgia will be serious, if small relative to         efforts in states more important to the electoral picture.       ’ ’         It’s plausible that these moves, combined with the effect         of the   candidates on the ticket and Democratic         turnout spurred by Trump’s anomalous candidacy, could be         enough to put Clinton just over the top. But it’s the         deep changes in Georgia’s makeup that have truly brought a         Clinton victory into the realm of possibility.       ’
