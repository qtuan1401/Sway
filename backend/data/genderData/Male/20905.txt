In an interview that aired on NBC’s “Today” on Friday, former Gov. Mitt Romney ( ) the 2012 GOP presidential nominee, explained why he decided to speak out about the presidential candidacy of Donald Trump a day earlier.  “I’ve wanted to be involved in the campaign, if you will, as a bit of a referee. When there were some foul balls, be able to call them and see if I can’t keep people guided on the path to becoming our next president. But the time came when Donald Trump’s outrage had reached such a level that I simply had to speak out. You get to the point where you say, your grandkids are going to say to you, ‘Papa, what did you do to stop Donald Trump?’ I had to finally get out and speak,” (  RCP Video) Follow Jeff Poor on Twitter @jeff_poor
