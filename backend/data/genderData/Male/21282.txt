After Sen. Marco Rubio pledged his allegiance to Donald Trump, the presumptive Republican presidential nominee returned the favor by urging his opponent who he derides as “Little Marco” to change his mind about giving up his Senate seat. [Poll data shows that Marco Rubio does by far the best in holding onto his Senate seat in Florida,” Trump wrote on Twitter last night. “Important to keep the MAJORITY. Run Marco!”  But Rubio has declined interest in running for   keeping to his decision he made when he ran for president. Florida Lieutenant Governor Carlos   a friend of Rubio’s, is running in a crowded primary to succeed him. “He’s focused on his campaign and I think he’s doing well, you know, he’s a good friend and I think he’d be a good senator,” Rubio said of   according to Bloomberg News. But Rubio could change his mind, as the filing deadline for the primary isn’t until June 24. He told reporters yesterday that it would be “unlikely” that he would change his mind but he didn’t rule it out completely. According to a report from Politico, Senate Majority Mitch McConnell encouraged all Republican senators to attempt to persuade Rubio to change his mind.
