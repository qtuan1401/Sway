Representative John Culberson ( ) joined the fight to lift the U.

Let’s get the president to intervene for you. ”  Representative Culberson left little room for misinterpretation of his opinion by adding, “Michael, this is really absurd, England should be embarrassed. ” After sending the email, Rep.

He told Savage he would raise the issue with both President Trump and with Vice President Mike Pence, whom he knows personally.

He wrote to Clinton:
