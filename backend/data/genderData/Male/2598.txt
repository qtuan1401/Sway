(Want to get this briefing by email? Here’s the  .) Good evening. Here’s the latest. 1. The world lost another revered musician: Prince died at his home in Minnesota. He was 57. No cause of death has been given, but his publicist said last week that he was “fighting the flu” after reports that his plane made an emergency landing because of a health scare. His death comes just months after David Bowie, also lauded across the musical spectrum, died at age 69. _____ 2. The most important decision Republican voters make in Pennsylvania next week may not be choosing a candidate, but choosing delegates. The unusual way the state selects them means the 54 unbound delegates sent to the national convention could well end up casting decisive votes for a nominee who is not Donald Trump. Meanwhile, the divisive Republican nomination fight is forcing the party to scale back its spending. _____ 3. On the Democratic side, Bernie Sanders is under intense pressure to win the Pennsylvania primary on Tuesday. A loss for the senator would mean watching Hillary Clinton  —   who has burned through tens of millions of dollars  —   add to her already sizable delegate lead and potentially hamper his   efforts. If Mrs. Clinton secures the nomination, her embrace of military engagements abroad will most likely set her apart from any Republican rival. _____ 4. President Obama’s trip to Saudi Arabia wrapped up after a series of   sessions about regional security with the leaders of six Persian Gulf nations. He’s headed to London, where he’ll offer birthday wishes to Queen Elizabeth II (she is 90 today). Also happening Friday: World leaders will sign the landmark Paris agreement to tackle climate change, although experts say the plan doesn’t go far enough. _____ 5. The owners of nearly 500, 000 diesel Volkswagen cars in the United States that are outfitted with illegal emissions software will be able to sell the cars back to the company or get them fixed, under an agreement reached today. They’ll get additional compensation, too, but how much hasn’t been determined. Other details of the settlement, including what the automaker will pay in fines, are also still to be negotiated. _____ 6. There are   in the television world: ESPN fired the analyst Curt Schilling, above, over offensive remarks he made on social media, and at ABC, Kelly Ripa has been absent from the show “Live With Kelly and Michael” since being told at the last minute that her   Michael Strahan, would move to “Good Morning America. ” For Mr. Schilling, comments about transgender people this week were just the latest to have led to controversy. _____ 7. Uber can keep categorizing drivers in California and Massachusetts as independent contractors. The landmark agreement, reached through a settlement in a pair of   lawsuits, is a significant victory for the   service, which agreed to pay as much as $100 million to about 385, 000 drivers. _____ 8. An already flooded Houston got even more rain, but forecasters are hopeful that the skies will stay dry for a couple of days after the latest storm system moves out. At least eight deaths have been blamed on the weather, which has dumped more than a foot of rain on the city and surrounding counties since Sunday. _____ 9. In Vancouver, 110 addicts have prescriptions to receive three daily doses of heroin  —   injected by a nurse, in a clinic. It’s the only medical facility in North America permitted to prescribe the drug’s active ingredient, and its supporters say it has helped addicts repair their fractured lives. But in the United States, proposals for similar programs have been criticized over concerns that they would encourage more drug use. _____ 10. Meet the island fox. It is small and adorable, and nearly every member of the species is literally identical. The animals, smaller than a house cat, live on islands off the coast of Southern California. Scientists are trying to figure out how their lack of genetic variation hasn’t seriously threatened their survival. _____ 11. Finally, here’s our wine critic’s list of 20 bottles that cost less than $20. Happy spring! Don’t fret if you can’t find these particular ones: Our critic says the greatest opportunity to find values is in the range of $15 to $25. Your Evening Briefing is posted at 6 p. m. Eastern.
