Sunday, on CNN’s “State of the Union With Jake Tapper,” Democratic presidential candidate Hillary Clinton said that the foreign policy Republican   Donald Trump detailed in an address last week was “disturbing. ”  Clinton said, “I certainly read about it, and I think it’s quite concerning. His talk about pulling out of NATO, his talk about letting other countries have nuclear weapons, which runs counter to 70 years of bipartisan national security policy, his idea that he has a ‘secret plan’ to get rid of ISIS that he’s not going to tell anybody. I found it disturbing. Because  —   I, as a senator from New York for eight years, as secretary of state for four years, I know that the stakes are high, that we face some real challenges and dangers in the world. And I don’t think loose talks about loose nukes, I don’t think turning our back on our strongest allies, I don’t think pretending you have some sort of secret plan is a very smart way to go forward in leading the world, which is what we must do. ” Follow Pam Key On Twitter @pamkeyNEN
