 (CNN) President Donald Trump, in an interview published Sunday, addressed his much discussed Twitter account, saying he doesn’t regret any of his messages, including his claim that he was wiretapped by former President Barack Obama.  In the interview with the Financial Times, which is based in Britain, President Trump doubled down on his unproven tweet last month stating his predecessor ordered a wiretapping of Trump Tower. ”Now my last tweet . .. the one about being    in quotes    wiretapped, meaning surveilled. Guess what, it is turning out to be true,” he said.   Trump didn’t go further to explain how his claims were being proved, but about his Twitter habit in general he said, ”I don’t regret anything, because there is nothing you can do about it.”   ”You know if you issue hundreds of tweets, and every once in a while you have a clinker, that’s not so bad.”   Trump also addressed his meeting with German Chancellor Angela Merkel, saying he ”really liked her” and didn’t mean to ignore her attempts at shaking hands during a photo op.   ”I shook hands about five times and then we were sitting in two seats . .. and I guess a reporter said ’shake her hand.’ I didn’t hear it,” the President said, referring to a video that went viral of the two leaders sitting in the Oval Office.   The two leaders spoke last week on the telephone about the visit that was viewed by many as awkward and frosty.  ”I had a great meeting with her, I really liked her,” Trump told the Financial Times. ”She said the same thing to me, we had a great meeting and the press doesn’t get it.”
