James Mattis appears to have made him   rethink that stance. ’ ’   On Saturday, Trump met with the retired   general at his   Bedminster, New Jersey, golf course  to discuss the possibility   Mattis could be tapped to serve as defense secretary.  ’ ’   Details about the private conversation are hard to come by,    to reporters at The New York Times when asked about   waterboarding. ’ ’   From the Times: ’ ’’ ’   It amounts to a ”remarkable” reversal for the     as the Times put it.

Michael Flynn, who  that ”all options are on the table.”   Before he campaigned for Trump, however, Flynn  ’ ”   If indeed Trump has changed his tune on the use of torture,   that’s good news to a number of   experts    election win. ” ’   ”I don’’t think it’’s going to come back,” Tom Nichols, a professor   at the Naval War College speaking of his personal views, said   recently. ”But that’’s more hope than anything else.” ’ ’   Mattis appears  Trump   told the Times he was ”seriously considering” the retired officer   for the position. ’ ’   The debate over waterboarding in enhanced interrogations has a   larger legal barrier than what President George W. Bush faced in   the past. While Bush authorized the practice after the     terror attacks through legal memos, President Barack Obama   ordered the practice to stop through an executive order. That   order  in 2015. ’ ’   Gen. Joe Dunford, the chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff,    in March that the use of waterboarding is ”inconsistent   with the values of our nation.” Dunford previously served as   Mattis’’ deputy at 1st Marine Division. ’
