(Want to get this briefing by email? Here’s the  .) Good evening. Here’s the latest. 1. The Obama administration struck back at Russia for its efforts to influence the 2016 election, listing a sweeping set of sanctions that could box in   Donald J. Trump. Mr. Trump, who has consistently cast doubt on a Russian role in the hacking, will now have to decide whether to lift the sanctions  —   effectively rejecting the findings of intelligence agencies. Mr. Trump responded to the Russian sanctions by reiterating his call to “move on. ” But he pledged to meet with intelligence officials. _____ 2. The Syrian government and Russia announced a   with rebel groups and with Turkey  —   a potential game changer in a civil war that has lasted six years. Many previous agreements have failed, but the dynamics have changed since   forces fully retook Aleppo. In Iraq, a long and difficult fight lies ahead for forces trying to liberate Mosul from the Islamic State. Our photojournalist documented what it’s like inside the fighting zone. _____ 3. “Israelis do not need to be lectured about the importance of peace by foreign leaders,” Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu said, reacting to Secretary of State John Kerry’s harsh rebuke of Israel for settlements in the West Bank and East Jerusalem. Leaders from both sides of the settlement debate said Mr. Kerry had delivered a “eulogy” for a   solution. The address was criticized by U. S. lawmakers from both parties, and was essentially rejected by   Donald J. Trump even before it was delivered. _____ 4. Germany and its former colony, Namibia, are engaged in intense negotiations to put an end to one of Europe’s ugliest chapters in Africa’s past. Tens of thousands of Namibians were killed in what historians call the 20th century’s first genocide. Germany is finally close to recognizing it as such. Above, a memorial in Namibia. _____ 5. “We have 700 murders here. I don’t want my kids to be 701. ” Victor Bloomingberg, a father in Chicago, talks about the dangers children face while walking to school in the city. The number of people murdered there in 2016 has actually climbed above 750, a 58 percent increase over last year and more than in New York and Los Angeles combined. _____ 6. China’s “iPhone City” was built in large part on billions of dollars worth of perks, tax breaks and subsidies, our investigation reveals. The world’s biggest iPhone factory, which can make 500, 000 of the devices per day, illustrates how China not only provides a large pool of labor it also offers incentives that would be difficult to replicate in the United States. The iPhone still costs less in American stores than in Chinese ones. _____ 7. When a female sophomore at Stanford University accused a player on the school’s football team of rape, she turned to the school’s interdisciplinary board for help. But Stanford has an uncommonly high bar for sexual assault cases. Despite the majority of people on two panels ruling in favor of the accuser, the athlete was never punished. _____ 8. No one can know if actress Debbie Reynolds  —   who died on Wednesday, a day after the death of her daughter, Carrie Fisher  —   died of a broken heart. But death from a broken heart is a   occurrence. It’s called Takotsubo syndrome, when a sudden flood of stress hormones causes a temporary weakening of the heart muscle. We spoke with a photographer who captured an intimate photo of a young Ms. Fisher watching her mother perform. _____ 9. As the Year of the Rooster approaches in China, a    statue of one was installed in the northern Chinese city of Taiyuan. It bears a remarkable resemblance to Mr. Trump. The Seattle resident who designed the statue declined to comment on why he gave the bird   features, but he remarked on Twitter that the statue was “way more yuge than I expected. ” _____ 10. From the summit of a slumbering Hawaiian volcano, the   short for Panoramic Survey Telescope and Rapid Response System, has created the biggest digital map of the cosmos ever made. It lists the positions, colors and brightness of three billion stars, galaxies and other objects that amount to two petabytes of data, roughly equivalent to a billion selfies. _____ 11. Finally, meet a running marvel. Ed Whitlock, 85, of Milton, Ontario, has set dozens of   records, from the metric mile to the marathon. In October, he set his latest record at the Toronto Waterfront Marathon and became the oldest person to run 26. 2 miles in under four hours. “He’s about as close as you can get to minimal aging in a human individual,” said Dr. Michael Joyner, a researcher at the Mayo Clinic who has studied performance and aging.
