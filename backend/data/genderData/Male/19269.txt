Just a series of bizarre rants, personal feuds, and outright lies,” Clinton said of Trump’s platform. Clinton also spoke of Trump’s supposed “bizarre fascination” with “dictators and strongmen. ” Clinton and the Democrats are pushing an attack line similar to Democratic attacks on 1964 Republican candidate Barry Goldwater, who was painted as an unstable potential warmonger by Lyndon Johnson.
