Nancy Pelosi, the House Minority Leader,   called the ongoing cyber breaches  and a ”sad course of   events” for the party and the nation. ’ ”   Information gleaned from those security breaches has been   published by Wikileaks and, at times, cited by Donald Trump, the   Republican Party’s presidential nominee. ”
