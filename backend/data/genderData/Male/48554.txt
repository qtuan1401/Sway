’  ’ ’     Donald Trump has ideas, and he has feelings. He wants to “build     the wall. ” He wants Mexico to “pay for it. ” He wants to do     something “for the veterans. ” He wants to “take care of our     people. ” He wants to “win so much your head will spin,” and he     wants to deport “illegal immigrants. ”   ’ ’     What Trump doesn’t have are policies. We don’t know how he’ll     build a wall on our border with Mexico or how he’ll force the     Mexican government to pay for it. He doesn’t have details for     what he’ll do to improve the Department of Veterans Affairs or     how he’ll implement his ideas for health care or trade     reform.  and     you’re met with vague assertions and broad rhetoric. There’s     little detail on what Trump plans to spend, how he plans to pay     for it, and what he thinks his programs will look like. There     is no Team Trump policy shop translating his feelings and ideas     into actual plans. Or at least not anymore. .   ’ ’     His rhetoric is even more remarkable. Trump evinces little     knowledge of the details of public policy, stumbling over the     basics of American governance and frequently demonstrating his     ignorance of key challenges and issues in policymaking. On     Monday morning, for instance, Trump  President Obama     of keeping interest rates down, oblivious to the fact that the     White House isn’t responsible for interest rates —  the Federal     Reserve is.   ’ ’     Trump, simply put, doesn’t know anything, and we don’t know     anything about him. He is a political cipher who exists outside     traditional performance standards for presidential candidates,     and as a result he has dictated the terms on which the     political press judges him. Think of this as Trump’s first     public works project: He has built the curve on which he is     being graded.   ’ ’     This makes for a real contrast with Hillary Clinton, who is     known for the depth and breadth of her policy knowledge. And     regardless of where you stand on Clinton and her priorities,     you know what they are. Go to the  page of Clinton’s campaign website,     and you’re bombarded with policies.

Overall, her     website has policy statements available for 38 different issue     areas.   ’ ’     Clinton has given enough detail that we can begin to speculate     about what she would do as president. For Trump, we have to     guess at his agenda —  or at least, anything beyond “build the     wall” and “make Mexico pay for it” —  and at how he would behave     as president.   ’ ’  ’ ’     Think of this as the first massive public works project of a     Trump administration: He has built the curve on which he is     being graded.   ’ ’     This dynamic goes beyond questions of policy. It is one of the     defining features of this campaign. Clinton behaves like a     normal politician, albeit one on the secretive side, and Trump     is a radical outlier, revealing nothing about his health, his     taxes, or his business dealings.   ’ ’     On Sunday, the political press was consumed with the story of     Clinton’s apparent illness at a   memorial event in New York     City.  captured by a bystander, shows     Clinton collapsing as she entered a vehicle. The Clinton     campaign refused to inform its press pool and stonewalled on     the event until persistent criticism forced a . Clinton has been     battling allergies and is sick with pneumonia. She was     dehydrated and exhausted, and she went wobbly as a result.   ’ ’     The reaction to this, from the press, is that Clinton should     have been more transparent. And they’re right. Team Clinton     should have revealed the candidate’s illness. And after the     incident in New York, the Clinton campaign should have     immediately informed the press of the situation. Team Clinton     seems to have learned its lessons; this week, the candidate     will release  to the public.  it’s a     victory for campaign transparency.   ’ ’     But lost in the controversy is this fact: Insofar that we can     even speculate about Clinton’s health, it’s because she     released a detailed doctor’s note to the public, shortly after     announcing her campaign.   ’ ’     Other than a  from     his alleged doctor, we know little about Trump’s health.     Indeed, despite his ubiquity on television and cable news, we     know little about Trump as a candidate. He refuses to release     his tax returns (you can read every one of Clinton’s going back     to 1990); refuses to say what he’ll do with his businesses and     assets if elected president, despite ; and refuses to answer questions     about his foundation.   ’ ’  ’ ’     None of this makes Clinton a model citizen. From her private     email server at the State Department to her speeches to banks     and other institutions, Clinton has been opaque and unwilling     to divulge details. She is secretive, even when the truth is     far from scandalous, as with her illness this past weekend.     Given this, we should press her for more transparency. We     should demand more disclosure from her campaign and more time     with reporters. But in making those demands, we should neither     forget nor neglect the extent to which Trump is unprecedented     in his contempt for transparency.   ’ ’     Given the tenor of coverage in this election, it is fair to say     that there is a double standard at work. Clinton is covered     like a presidential nominee, while Trump is still treated like     a sideshow, as if he’ll never be president.  at NBC News’        Forum. Clinton was questioned like someone     who might soon sit in the Oval Office, while Trump enjoyed the     soft bigotry of low expectations.   ’ ’     That may make sense —  the polls are still in Clinton’s favor. But     the more Trump isn’tscrutinized for his unusual     disdain for disclosure, the more likely it is that we find     ourselves in a world where Donald Trump is president, and we     know nothing about him or how he intends to lead the country.     This is how the sideshow wins.   ’
