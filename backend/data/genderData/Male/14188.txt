The polls have closed in Georgia’s Sixth Congressional district for the special election between Democrat Jon Ossoff and Republican Karen Handel. [The special election has turned out to be the most expensive in U. S. history, with each side pouring in tens of millions of dollars to back their particular candidate as Democrats see a potential   and Republicans see an opportunity to hold off the left once and for all in the era of President Donald Trump.  President Trump has urged his supporters in Georgia to turn out in a series of Tweets, including one on Tuesday morning: KAREN HANDEL FOR CONGRESS. She will fight for lower taxes, great healthcare strong   hard worker who will never give up! VOTE TODAY,  —   Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) June 20, 2017,  The race comes in a district left open by former Rep. Tom Price ( ) who vacated the seat when he became President Trump’s Health and Human Services (HHS) Secretary. President Trump won the traditionally Republican district narrowly in November against Democrat Hillary Rodham Clinton. In an exclusive interview with Breitbart News the day before the election, Handel told senior editor Joel Pollak that she expects to win. “There has definitely been a significant bias from the local media like nothing like I have ever experienced,” Handel said. “But I intend to have the last laugh when I win tomorrow. ” Ossoff, in an interview on election day with CNN, called Handel a “career politician” and contrasted that with himself who he says is “a fresh voice who wants to work across the aisle to get things done to grow our economy, work to make healthcare more accessible and affordable for women and folks with   conditions. ” Ossoff also said “clearly there is a lot of national interest,” but that he will “leave it to the pundits —  the folks at CNN —  to assess the national implications. ” Final polls in the district have shown a race that has come down to the wire, and it remains to be seen who won. Now, as of 7 p. m. ET in the suburban Atlanta district, the polls have closed. Follow along with Breitbart News in this livewire as the results will begin trickling in soon. ********* UPDATES BELOW ********* Last Laugh:  She called it. @KarenHandel gets the last laugh.

Even CNN’s Brian Stelter —  the most ardent defender of the network President Trump has labeled a “very fake news” outlet —  recognizes the epic fail for the establishment media and the win for grassroots conservative media like Breitbart News. It’s notable that even Stelter is publicly Tweeting about Breitbart News since he continues to refuse to appear on Breitbart News Daily, Breitbart News Saturday and Breitbart News Sunday on SiriusXM 125 The Patriot Channel when asked —  for months since even before the 2016 presidential election —  if he was courageous enough to publicly defend his network’s conduct on Breitbart radio.

M. The Republican National Committee’s Michael Ahrens calls out the media and the Democrats in his statement tonight: “For every reporter who covered this race as a referendum against President Trump and his agenda, it’s time to refocus your stories. The Democrats spent over $30M for Jon Ossoff to get the same 47% that Hillary Clinton did in   in 2016  —   and to underperform his 48. 1% in the April primary. Ossoff ran the Democrats’ playbook for 2018, with his “Make Trump Furious” campaign and all of the Democrat and “Resistance” resources at his disposal. As Democrats go   in House special elections, there’s no other way to view the party but as limping into 2018. ” UPDATE 11:28 P. M.

Top conservatives, including Americans for Limited Government president Rick Manning, say the takeaway from Handel’s victory is that Republicans on Capitol Hill need to get with President Trump’s program and kickstart the Trump agenda now: “The Georgia Congressional race should serve as a   call for the GOP in Washington, D. C. to get to work on President Trump’s agenda,” Manning said in a statement. “The   rope a dope strategy where they spend more time on vacation than doing the people’s business will lead to catastrophic results in November of 2018. Speaker Ryan should immediately cancel the August recess and move aggressively forward on the President’s agenda with an emphasis on economic growth measures, including laying the groundwork for tax cuts, turning the President’s infrastructure plan into legislation and sending it to the Senate, and cutting the budget in accordance with the Trump budget. The House of Representatives is not saddled with the filibuster and the GOP Conference needs to be aggressive in passing limited government legislation across Capitol Hill to the Senate. ” UPDATE 11:00 P.

Here’s a full statement from Ronna Romney McDaniel, the national chairwoman of the Republican National Committee, on Ossoff’s embarrassing loss and Handel’s and President Trump’s huge win in Georgia: “I want to offer my warmest congratulations to Karen Handel on her victory. Tonight, the people of Georgia’s Sixth District overwhelmingly voted not only for Karen, but also for President Trump’s agenda of replacing our broken healthcare system, reforming an outdated tax code, and prioritizing infrastructure investment. For the fourth time since November, voters have rejected the Democrat’s agenda of obstruction and made it clear it’s time get to work for the American people and join President Trump’s administration in Making America Great Again. ” UPDATE 10:54 P. M. GOP “smart set” downplays significance of Handel’s and Trump’s victory tonight: The truth is, #GA06 was meaningless either way. Parties and media imbued it with special significance. It has none.  —   S. E.

M. Handel, in her victory speech, delivered thanks to her supporters. “This was going to be a very tight race  …     and was going to require all hands on deck,” Handel said, “and that’s exactly what we had. ” Handel thanked the many Republicans she ran against in the primary for helping her against Ossoff, and thanked many from the Georgia GOP congressional delegation including the U. S. Senators from Georgia. She thanked Speaker Paul Ryan and House GOP leadership. “And a special thanks to the president of the United States of America,” she added to cheers of “TRUMP! TRUMP! TRUMP!” from the audience, before adding as well: “But let’s not forget our equally great vice president, Mike Pence. ” Handel also gave a   to House Majority Whip Steve Scalise, who was shot in a GOP baseball practice before the congressional baseball game last week. She said Scalise and her were in constant communication until his shooting, and that Scalise called her the “terminator” in a text message. She said the shooting was a “tragedy. ” “We need to find a more civil way to deal with our disagreement because in these United States of America no one  —   no one  —   should ever feel their life threatened over their political beliefs and positions,” Handel said. “And I say that, ladies and gentlemen, with regard to both sides of the political aisle. ” Handel also thanked the grassroots supporters who went    in the Georgia heat this spring and summer to turn out the vote for her campaign. Handel said that Ossoff was “more than gracious” in his concession to her and she wished Ossoff and his fiancee Alicia the best in the “new life they’re going to be starting. ” Handel also mentioned her predecessors in this Georgia sixth district seat —  former House Speaker Newt Gingrich, U. S. Sen. Johnny Isakson ( ) and Health and Human Services Secretary Tom Price —  noting she has “big shoes to fill. ” “I will work every day to make this state and this country a better place,” Handel said. President Trump also Tweets a third time, offering more congratulations for Handel’s big win over Ossoff and Hollywood: Congratulations to Karen Handel on her big win in Georgia 6th.

The people of Georgia’s 6th Congressional District are the big winners tonight because they have elected a representative who is going to tirelessly fight for them and their interests. Karen is all business. I’ve campaigned with her and I know how eager she is to get to work.

Handel appeared at campaign headquarters not to declare victory, but just to say she wants to dot all her I’s and cross all her T’s before she declares victory. But she is expected to be the next U. S. representative from Georgia’s sixth district. UPDATE 10:06 P. M.  Who’s laughing now? A flashback to Breitbart senior editor Joel Pollak’s exclusive interview with Karen Handel, the Republican candidate who just defeated Democrat Jon Ossoff in the special election in Georgia’s sixth congressional district, who said on Monday that she intended to win: “There has definitely been a significant bias from the local media like nothing like I have ever experienced,” Handel told Breitbart News. “But I intend to have the last laugh when I win tomorrow. ” UPDATE 10:02 P. M. CNN’s David Chalian tries to spin Handel’s upset victory over Ossoff as nothing great for Trump, but somehow good news for House Speaker Paul Ryan and Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell.

And, right on cue, the media starts spinning for the Democrats tonight: SC a warning sign for Rs.  See Kershaw Co (home of Camden!) Trump wins by 15 in Nov, Rs only won by 6 tonight  70% white county,  —   Jonathan Martin (@jmartNYT) June 21, 2017,  But upon further inspection, it appears that Ossoff voters are nearly impossible to reach because they are —  as Hillary Clinton would say —  basement dwellers: Ossoff Voters Impossible To Reach Because They Live With Their Parents, Democratic Organizer Says https:  .  pic. twitter.   —   The Daily Caller (@DailyCaller) June 20, 2017,  UPDATE 9:16 P. M. Handel opens up a nearly   lead now, as things looking bleaker in Georgia for the Democrats. Her 52. 6 percent with 96, 130 votes leads Ossoff’s 47. 4 percent with 86, 531 votes, per Decision Desk HQ. Not good for Democrats right now. Our Democrat friend at Ossoff’s HQ tells us that “I love the sofa pundits on Twitter who are saying the Dem Party is done if we lose. This district wasn’t even supposed to be in play. The fact that we are playing it close in deep red districts should make them [worry] heading into 2018. ” But Ossoff being down 6 points in Fulton County is not a good spot to be. UPDATE 9:10 P. M. Still waiting for   ballots in Georgia: Karen Handel is up by almost 4, 000 votes right now. Waiting for   which could be a game changer.  —   Decision Desk HQ (@DecisionDeskHQ) June 21, 2017,  But Republican Ralph Norman seems to have pulled off a victory in South Carolina: COLUMBIA, S. C.

M.  Whoa, another big pile of votes is in and Handel’s lead widens more. She’s now at 51. 9 percent with 85, 316 votes compared to Ossoff’s 48. 1 percent with 79, 121 votes, per Decision Desk HQ. Rep. John Lewis ( ) however, seems optimistic at Ossoff HQ. More Rep. John Lewis @Ossoff:  ”I have never seen anything like this.  This is not just a campaign, it is a movement.”  —   Patricia Murphy (@1PatriciaMurphy) June 21, 2017,  UPDATE 9:05 P. M.  Handel’s lead in the latest returns has gotten a bit wider, as she’s now at 51. 4 percent with 78, 574 votes to Ossoff’s 48. 6 percent with 74, 276 votes. That      lead is still tight and this is not over yet. UPDATE 8:54 P. M. Over in South Carolina, it’s a lot closer than expected: 35 percent reporting from SC5  —   Parnell (D) leads Norman (R)  %.  Back stop for Norman may be York County,  —   Jamie Dupree (@jamiedupree) June 21, 2017,  49 percent of precincts reporting in SC5 and Norman (R) leads Parnell (D) by 50. 4 to 48. 7%  —   Jamie Dupree (@jamiedupree) June 21, 2017,  No votes reported yet from the Rock Hill, SC area in SC5  —   most in from west of US 321,  —   Jamie Dupree (@jamiedupree) June 21, 2017,  But it does not appear to be close enough, at this time, in either spot —  South Carolina or Georgia —  for the Democrats: If Parnell loses #SC05 by  % lots of Ds will point fingers. But it’s possible he’s doing well *because* he wasn’t hyped, not despite it.  —   Dave Wasserman (@Redistrict) June 21, 2017,  Looks like two more huge ”moral victories” for Democrats and two more Republicans being sworn into Congress.  —   Phil Kerpen (@kerpen) June 21, 2017,  UPDATE 8:50 P. M. An update on where things stand with vote counting: With about   early   votes tallied, that leaves 25K or more mail ballots in #GA06 (I think. Based on 140K total early votes)  —   Scott Bland (@PoliticoScott) June 21, 2017,  UPDATE 8:46 P. M. It’s a little tighter now with a few more thousand votes in, with Handel at 50. 8 percent and Ossoff at 49. 2 percent. Follow along at Decision Desk HQ. They’re a little faster tonight than others. UPDATE 8:43 P. M. Both sides have things to lose after tonight though no matter which way it goes. What a bloody mess. While we’re waiting for the next data dump, here are the national D (https:  . )  R (https:  . ) worries re #GA06,  —   Gabriel Debenedetti (@gdebenedetti) June 21, 2017,  UPDATE 8:41 P. M. Former Bernie Sanders spokeswoman is now spinning this as NOT a referendum on Trump, but on healthcare: Before the hottakes on #GA06 + Trump start rolling, I’d like to note: THIS IS NOT A REFERENDUM ON TRUMP. It’s more about health care.  —   Symone D. Sanders (@SymoneDSanders) June 20, 2017,  So does that mean if Handel wins that Democrats in red states will support efforts to repeal and replace Obamacare, or is that just more spin? UPDATE 8:37 P. M. Handel has now taken a two point lead per Decision Desk HQ returns numbers, up 51 percent to 49 percent over Ossoff. Her 70, 815 votes are a couple grand better than his 68, 147 votes. UPDATE 8:31 P. M. The most up to date numbers we can find have Handel in the lead, with 68, 661 votes and 50. 7 percent of the vote, as compared with Ossoff’s 49. 3 percent and 66, 669 votes. Those are on Decision Desk HQ. UPDATE 8:27 P. M. Both Dana Bash and Anderson Cooper, on CNN, say President Trump has every right to take a victory lap if Karen Handel wins. UPDATE 8:25 P. M. Now it seems the results are fluctuating,. CNN is reporting a minor lead for Ossoff. We hear from Ossoff’s headquarters people are cheering the results, and chanting “FLIP THE 6th!” CNN’s numbers have Ossoff with 58, 152 votes and Handel with 56, 619 votes. But CNN seems to be behind, since these numbers below have Handel back in the lead barely: Handel  50. 0%  60, 718Jon Ossoff  50. 0% 60, 712,  —   Laffy (@GottaLaff) June 21, 2017,  It’s going down to the wire: It’s a BARNBURNER  …     #GA06 https:  .   —   David M. Drucker (@DavidMDrucker) June 21, 2017,  UPDATE 8:15 P. M. The race is, as expected, tightening a bit as well. With a little more than 126, 000 votes in, Handel still leads with 50. 4 percent of the vote to Ossoff’s 49. 6 percent. Our Democrat friend who’s supporting Ossoff tells us that the the person who did the best outreach to seniors likely will win. UPDATE 8:12 P. M. Here’s the spin to expect from the left if Handel wins, from a Democrat who’s supporting Ossoff tonight who spoke to Breitbart News on condition of anonymity from the Ossoff party via phone: Democrats believe now they can be competitive in red states and district if they fight, Ossoff won more votes than Democrats historically do in this district, and Ossoff to win the seat needed to avoid the runoff to begin with. Not a good sign for them right now, but again it’s still early. UPDATE 8:10 P. M. Not looking good for Democrats at all tonight: . @Karen Handel says early returns  showing her leading Ossoff in 6th District Congressional Runoff a good first sign @FOX5Atlanta #fox5atl,  —   Deidra Dukes (@DeidraDukesFOX5) June 21, 2017,  Well that’s a bit unexpected. Handel just showed up to her election night party, less than an hour after polls closed.  —   Gabriel Debenedetti (@gdebenedetti) June 20, 2017,  ”Everything we’re seeing is really encouraging,” says Handel in ATL. ”To win   absentee voting is very big. Very, very big.” #GA06,  —   Gabriel Debenedetti (@gdebenedetti) June 20, 2017,  National Democrats from the DNC are worried this bodes horribly for the midterm elections in 2018, too: DNC Associate Chair Jaime Harrison, concedes a loss in GA will expose the party not fully prepared to take back the House.  —   Helyn Bolanis (@helynbolanis) June 20, 2017,  And now the media class is furiously shifting their spin: The MSM’s analysis is laughable tonight: If Ossoff wins, it means ☆☆☆EVERYTHING☆☆☆ If Handel wins, it means whatever. #GA06,  —   Harlan Z. Hill (@Harlan) June 21, 2017,    UPDATE 7:58 P. M.  It’s by no means over. This could swing either way based off these early returns: Right now the NYT tracker is saying, based on counted votes, that we should end up between Ossoff by 6. 5 and Handel by 8. I concur.  —   Sean T at RCP (@SeanTrende) June 20, 2017,  But Handel has already appeared at her event and is very confident based off early results: 1st appearance of Handel at her event. Touting 10k early vote swing from primary. Says everything they’re seeing ”incredibly encouraging”  —   Kaylee Hartung (@KayleeHartung) June 20, 2017,  UPDATE 7:54 P. M. MSNBC’s Steve Kornacki is saying early returns are an “ominous sign” for Ossoff. Meanwhile, the trend line is moving towards Handel: The NYT’s odometer of doom is speaking  …    . pic. twitter.   —   Andrew Clark (@AndrewHClark) June 20, 2017,  UPDATE 7:52 P. M. The Root reporter Jason Johnson, reporting on MSNBC live from Ossoff’s headquarters, is already predicting a Handel win tonight. If she does pull it off, expect the left and media to go absolutely bonkers. UPDATE 7:50 P. M. Nate Cohn seems to think earliest returns show good signs for Handel, but this is by no means over. Handel wins the   early vote in Fulton —  that’s not a bad sign for her.  —   Nate Cohn (@Nate_Cohn) June 20, 2017,  Remember, of course, that there’s a degree of fungibility in all of this. Does it mean Dems do even better in mail (where Dems are best?)  —   Nate Cohn (@Nate_Cohn) June 20, 2017,  UPDATE 7:45 P. M. And, wouldn’t you know, we now have some results per Decision Desk HQ. Handel has an early edge of 3 percent, as she’s up with 51. 5 percent to Ossoff’s 48. 5 percent. Of the 72, 691 votes in, Handel has 37, 435 votes and Ossoff has 35, 256 votes. MSNBC’s Chris Matthews notes that Handel is expected to do well in the area that’s reporting, Fulton County, so this is not surprising she’s out to an early lead. UPDATE 7:41 P. M.  Even the Democrats now privately think Handel will beat Ossoff, barely. But nobody is confident: Folks on both sides of   privately, think that Handel is gonna win by a hair tonight. But neither side very confident.  —   Reid J. Epstein (@reidepstein) June 20, 2017,  Democrats have called Breitbart News throughout the day to independently confirm this sentiment, too. We’ll see what happens when the results trickle in shortly. UPDATE 7:40 P. M. We know, we know. Polls have been closed for a while and still no actual results. They’re expected around 8 p. m.: I’m told results page for #GA6  —   https:  .   —   will go live around 8pm ET,  —   Kaylee Hartung (@KayleeHartung) June 20, 2017,  You can, like we are doing, continue refreshing at Decision Desk HQ or at Georgia Secretary of State website.

M.  Worth noting that despite all the Hollywood and      cash flowing into Ossoff’s campaign, he can’t even have an open bar for his supporters on election night: I won’t be first or last to tweet this, but the #ga06 candidate who shattered $ records has a cash bar at his victory party. pic. twitter.   —   Greg Bluestein (@bluestein) June 20, 2017,  Apparently the lefties’ fundraising wunderkind has shunned his supporters like this before: This happened on April 18 too.

M.  Over on MSNBC, Chris Matthews mentions that Democrats have a weak bench at the state and local level —  something this election may highlight. He says Democrats have no youngsters “on deck” lined up to back them up down the road.

M.  While the results are expected to be very close tonight in Georgia’s sixth district, it has traditionally been very Republican. So even if Handel wins, expect Democrats to spin it as a win even if they lose. GOP margins in   House races: 1992 +1694 +2896 +1698 +4299 *00 +5002 +6004 *06 +4508 +3710 * 12 +3014 +3216 +2417 ?  —   Steve Kornacki (@SteveKornacki) June 20, 2017,  Ronna Romney McDaniel, the chairwoman of the Republican National Committee (RNC) on Fox News tonight says she is “cautiously optimistic” that Handel will win tonight. She says the momentum shifted to Handel in the final days, and hammers Ossoff for not being able to even vote for himself since he does not live in the district. UPDATE 7:02 P. M.  Two polling locations are open for an extra half hour per Fox News, after a judge ordered them to stay open a little longer due to complications.
