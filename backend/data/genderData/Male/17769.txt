Sunday on CBS’s ‘Face The Nation,” former chief strategist for Barack Obama’s presidential campaigns David Axelrod said Democratic presidential nominee Hillary Clinton doesn’t have a “core message. ”  When asked if a core message is still a challenge for Clinton’s campaign, Axelrod said, “Well, yeah, I think it is challenge for them, but it’s completely overridden by the things that Frank Luntz just talked about. Donald Trump has become the issue in this campaign. He has made himself that. He has made himself the center of discussion. And that has overwhelmed every other issue. So even though she’s going into this election with historically high liability in comparison to Donald Trump, she is doing quite well. ” Follow Pam Key on Twitter @pamkeyNEN
