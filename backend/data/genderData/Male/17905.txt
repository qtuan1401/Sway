Rapper Demarcus Davis was arrested last week after he was seen on YouTube and in social media posts sending death threats to presumptive Republican presidential candidate Donald Trump  —   while brandishing stolen guns. [“I really want to go to war with Donald Trump because Donald Trump is tryin’ to take food stamps from my momma and that’s all the (expletive) she got,” the    Baton   rapper said in a YouTube video posted on May 22. “Let Donald Trump know it’s up over here. We want war we’re going to declare war. ”  In another video reportedly posted to social media on May 15, Davis  —   who goes by the rap name Maine Musik  —   and at least seven other people can be seen brandishing a number of weapons, including rifles, pistols and a   shotgun, according to Baton Rouge ABC affiliate WBRZ. When authorities examined the video, they noticed similarities between the weapons being waved around and weapons that had been stolen from a local Meaux Guns and Ammo store last July. A Baton Rouge police spokesman told the outlet that a stolen Ruger being brandished in the video was particularly easy to identify because it had been customized before it was stolen. Davis was arrested on June 3 and charged with three counts of being a felon in possession of a firearm and one count of illegal possession of a firearm, according to WBRZ. Police reportedly tracked down Davis by referring to a house number and street number that were clearly visible in the YouTube clip. Former Sons of Guns reality TV star Joe Meaux, who owns Meaux Guns and Ammo, said he realized the firearms being waved around by Davis were his after spotted a video entitled “Rapper Threatens Trump” online. “As I’m watching it, I’m thinking these guns are very recognizable,” Meaux told Fox News. “As I watched more, I realized that they were very familiar. They were stolen from me last year. ” “My guns are all very recognizable, we do a lot of custom work,” he added. “There was one   copy built from a . 22 I identified. Everything from the optic to the way the sling was placed was all very identifiable. ” Davis reportedly posted $23, 000 bail and was released the same day he was arrested. The Secret Service had been investigating Davis before Meaux picked up the phone to call local law enforcement, over the rapper’s threats against Trump. Investigators also found photos on Davis’s personal Instagram page, which boasts 56, 000 followers, showing him posing with guns. One video features a young girl shooting a replica handgun. “Many of the items have been recovered, but the matter is still under investigation so when that is completed we will hopefully get them back,” Meaux told Fox. “But the most important thing is that they are off the streets now. ” The rapper is free and awaiting his next court date. He posted a video Wednesday with a   message for Donald Trump. “F*ck Donald Trump,” Davis says, while waving a massive blade. “No more guns  …     It’s our summer 16, b*tch. ” (Warning: Explicit Content)  SHERWOOD USA BITCH ❗️❗️ #🕷Nation, A video posted by Maine Luciano (@maine_musik) on Jun 8, 2016 at 2:50pm PDT,    Follow Jerome Hudson on Twitter: @jeromeehudson
