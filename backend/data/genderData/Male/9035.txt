CNN anchor Anderson Cooper says he regrets making a “crude” and “unprofessional” remark about President Donald Trump to Jeffrey Lord live   Friday during a segment on AC360. [Lord, a CNN political commentator, and Cooper were debating a dubious New York Times story that claimed, based on anonymous sources, that Trump reportedly told Russian officials that former FBI Director James Comey is a “nut job. ”  “I don’t care what he says to the Russians he’s the President of the United States,” Lord told Cooper. Cooper crudely replied, “If he took a dump on his desk, you would defend it. I don’t know what he would do that you would not defend”: ”If he took a dump on his desk you would defend it.” 💩@andersoncooper what? 😲 pic. twitter.   —   Salvador Hernandez (@SalHernandez) May 20, 2017,  Cooper’s remarks, made live   quickly caused controversy on social media.
