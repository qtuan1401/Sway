’  ’ ”   A pastor interrupted Donald Trump’s speech before a black church   in Flint, Michigan, on Wednesday after Trump began to rip his   Democratic opponent, Hillary Clinton. ” ’   ”Mr. Trump, I invited you here to thank us for what we’’ve done   for Flint, not to give a political speech,” the pastor, Rev.   Faith   told the Republican presidential candidate. ’ ’   ”Oh OK, OK, OK, that’’s good,” Trump replied. ”Then I’’m going to   go back on to Flint.” ’ ”   The pastor’s actions were met with some applause from the   audience. Members in the crowd began asking Trump questions. ” ’   Trump replied to one, which couldn’’t be heard on the feed of the   speech, saying ”no, no, no, I never would.” ’ ”   The Manhattan billionaire promised to bring jobs back to Flint,   saying that he heard a phrase that people used to build cars in   Flint and couldn’t drink the water in Mexico. Now, he said, the   opposite is true. ” ”   Flint made national news earlier this year after the city’s water   supply was found to have toxic levels of lead, an effect of a   decision by government officials to switch its water source. ” ’ ’ ’   Before being interrupted, Trump said Clinton ”failed on the   economy, just like she’’s failed on foreign policy.” ’ ’   ”Everything she’’s touched didn’’t work out,” he said. ’
