’   Retired Lt. Gen. Mike Flynn, who is rumored to be on Donald   Trump’s short list of possible VP choices, said Sunday that he is     when it comes to the issue of abortion. ’ ’   “Abortion, I think for women, and these are difficult issues, but   I think women have to be able to choose  —   sort of a right of   choice,” Flynn said on ABC’s “This Week.” ’ ’   The general added: “But I think that’s a difficult legal   decision, and I think that women are so important in that     process. And they are the ones that have to make   that decision because they are the ones who are going to decide   to bring up that child or not. ” ’ ’ ’ ’Possible Trump VP pick Gen. Michael Flynn on abortion: ”Woman have to be able to choose.”  ’ ’   Flynn is considered to be a final contender in Trump’s search for   a running mate, but it’s unlikely his answer on abortion will   satisfy many in the Republican Party. ’ ’   Conservatives who have been skeptical of the Manhattan   billionaire’s conservative credentials have urged him to pick a   conservative with solid credentials to shore up the base. ’ ’’ ’   Flynn is a registered Democrat, something he addressed on “This   Week. ” ’ ’   “I grew up as a Democrat in a very strong Democratic family,” he   acknowledged. “But I will tell you that the Democratic Party that   exists in this country is not the Democratic Party I grew around   in my upbringing. Not at all. Totally different. ” ’ ’   Flynn added that he votes “for leaders,” not a party. ’ ’   “I vote for leadership and I vote for America,” he said. ’ ’   Trump is expected to unveil his pick for vice president in the   coming days. ’
