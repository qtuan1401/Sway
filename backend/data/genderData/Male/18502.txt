Tech entrepreneur and   of PayPal Peter Thiel suggested that he will work for the Trump administration as an informal adviser on subjects such as technology and innovation. [“A page in the book of history has turned, and there is an opening to think about some of our problems from a new perspective,” Thiel said. “I’ll try to help the president in any way I can. ”  Thiel, who publicly endorsed Donald Trump unlike the majority of other Silicon Valley leaders, donated $1. 25 millon to the Trump campaign and also spoke at this year’s Republican National Convention. He also gave a speech at the National Press Club in Washington, D. C. a week before the election where he warned people the movement behind the then Republican nominee was “not going away. ” Other Silicon Valley companies such as Google, Facebook, and Twitter all strongly opposed Trump’s candidacy, and Thiel was even pressured from figures in the industry to step down from his role as a board member at Facebook. Silicon Valley leaders such as Facebook   Dustin Moskovitz gave $35 million in an effort to defeat Donald Trump, while Apple CEO Tim cook and Microsoft founder Bill Gates were also considered as   picks by the Clinton campaign.
