Ohio Gov. John Kasich signed a bill into law Tuesday that will ban abortions after 20 weeks of pregnancy in Ohio. [However, Kasich vetoed a bill that would have prohibited abortions at the first detectable fetal heartbeat  —   as early as six weeks.  Fox News reports Kasich, who identifies himself as   chose to sign the   ban that is already similar to those 15 other states have enacted. Plans are underway by national   leaders to utilize the energy from Donald Trump’s win to push for new   legislation in 2017. One such   group, Americans United for Life (AUL) released a new report Tuesday that exposes hundreds of health and safety violations in abortion clinics across the nation.
