Former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton is trying to raise fears of deportation. During a campaign event today, Clinton described what she calls Donald Trump’s proposed “deportation force. ”[“I want you to think about that deportation force for a minute, where we would have police,    —   whatever his deportation force consists of  —   raiding homes and workplaces across America,” she said.  Clinton told the story of a young girl named “Carla” who had a heart condition. Clinton said it was the result of living in “constant fear” that her parents would get deported. She said the fear was “making her heart beat dangerously fast,” according to doctors. “So when Donald Trump talks about deporting 11 million immigrants, he’s talking about ripping apart families like Carla’s,” she said. Clinton made her remarks during a speech to union workers today at The United Food and Commercial Workers Union in Las Vegas. She reminded the audience about Trump calling illegal immigrants “rapists,” asserting that his was a “wrong and dangerous vision” for the United States. “We have to stand up for hard working American families and that includes hard working immigrant families,” she said as the crowd cheered. During her speech, Clinton declared that “we’re coming to the end of the Democratic primaries” and thanked Sen. Bernie Sanders for raising issues about unaccountable money in politics and income inequality. But she urged the Democratic party to come together to stop Trump. “We are going up against a candidate who will say anything, do anything to take us backwards on every issue and value we care about,” she said. Clinton argued for equal pay for woman and paid time off asserting that shortchange women in the work place was bad for America’s families. She repeated that if fighting for those issues meant she was playing the woman card: “Deal. Me. In. ” “I happen to believe that’s a winning hand my friends!” she concluded.
