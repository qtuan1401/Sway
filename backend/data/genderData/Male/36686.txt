Washington (CNN) Sarah Palin’s    Dakota Meyer, who received the Medal of Honor in 2011, said Tuesday Republican presidential nominee Donald Trump should apologize to the Khan family for comments he made about the Muslim parents of a slain US soldier. ”If @realDonaldTrump wants to be the Commander in Chief, he needs to act like one. And that cant start until he apologizes to the Khans,” Meyer tweeted. Meyer is married to Bristol Palin, daughter of Sarah Palin, the 2008 GOP vice presidential candidate and former Alaska governor who endorsed Trump in January. Republicans have criticized Trump for engaging in a war of words with Khizr and Ghazala Khan, parents of a soldier slain in Iraq, after the two took the stage during last week’s Democratic National Convention to disparage Trump’s proposed temporary ban on Muslims immigrating to the US. ”You have sacrificed nothing, and no one,” Khizr Khan had said. Hillary Clinton’s campaign, seeking to highlight the growing rift between Trump and   allies,   Meyer’s call for an apology on Tuesday. President Barack Obama awarded Meyer the Medal of Honor for his bravery during a   fight in Afghanistan. In recent years Meyer has been somewhat active in Republican politics, in addition to being Palin’s   . Meyer endorsed Sen. Ted Cruz in the Republican primaries this year    when the Texas senator was the main challenger to Trump. He also previously publicly considered a congressional run in Kentucky, but decided against it.
