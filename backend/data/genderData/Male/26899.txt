Friday on “The Pat Campbell Radio Show,” Sen. Ted Cruz ( ) said he would protect the Republican National Committee’s party platform from Donald Trump’s suggestions that he would like exceptions for  rape and incest to be included on the abortion policy.  When asked if he would protect the party platform from Trump’s potential changes, Cruz said, “You have my word. One of the reasons that we are continuing to work to elect conservatives to be delegates, even though Donald has the delegates to get the nomination, we intend to do everything we can to fight for conservative principles to prevent Washington forces from watering down the platform. The platform is a manifestation of what we believe as a party, and I think it is important that it continue to reflect conservative values,   values, constitutional liberties,   principles, the values that built this country, and that is exactly what I intend to fight for. ” Follow Pam Key on Twitter @pamkeyNEN
