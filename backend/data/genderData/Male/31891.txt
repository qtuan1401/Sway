The 58th inaugural will celebrate American history and heritage, while setting the course to a brighter and bolder future for all Americans,” Tom Barrack, the chairman of the Presidential Inaugural Committee, said in a news release Friday. ”Above all, it will serve as tribute to one of our greatest attributes, the peaceful transition of partisan power.” Broadway star Jennifer Holliday was also announced as one of the scheduled performers but she backed out Saturday. In an open letter to her fans, she said one of the main reasons for her decision to pull out was the backlash she received from the LGBTQ community, and she called her initial decision to perform a ”lapse of judgement.”  Another event to be held the same day, called Voices of the People, will feature a number of marching bands and related troupes.  Both of the events are open to the public.
