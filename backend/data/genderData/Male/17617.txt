Part of former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton’s plan to appeal to New Yorkers in the upcoming primary is attacking the plans of one of their most controversial fellow citizens: Donald Trump. [In a new ad directed at New Yorkers, Clinton remarks on the diversity of the city of 20 million people.  “So when some say we can solve America’s problems by building walls  —   banning people based on their religion and turning against each other well, this is New York. And we know better,” she says.  Clinton doesn’t mention Trump by name, but the video highlights a Trump 2016 construction site sign. The primary is held April 4, but Clinton is making her way to Harlem today to campaign. An Emerson College poll of the state in March showed Clinton leading her Democratic rival Bernie Sanders by 48 points.
