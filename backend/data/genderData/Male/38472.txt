 (CNN) The Republican establishment could have stopped Trump but instead surrendered to him months, perhaps years, ago. When they want to criticize opponents for being   Republicans often recall Neville Chamberlain and his policy of appeasing Adolf Hitler. And yet that is exactly the approach that the party’s senior leaders took with Trump    appeasing him in the hope that doing so would satisfy his appetites. They tolerated, excused and covered up for Trump as he began his political career with ”birther” racism, launched his presidential campaign with   slurs and heightened it with   bigotry, and thrilled crowds with policies that would be unconstitutional or amount to war crimes    all while demeaning and objectifying women. Winston Churchill said of appeasers: ”Each one hopes that if he feeds the crocodile enough, the crocodile will eat him last.” Trump will lose the election. Forget his dismal polls last week. He has almost never been ahead of Hillary Clintons for a single week since they were both nominated. The major models predicting the election have only once or twice put his chances over 40 percent.
