Companies across the U. S significantly increased hiring levels in the month of November following Donald Trump’s election, a new report from the payroll processor ADP revealed. [During November, approximately 216, 000 people were hired, particularly in the retail sector, in the biggest recruitment drive since June of this year.  “Businesses hired aggressively in November and there is little evidence that the uncertainty surrounding the presidential election dampened hiring,” said Mark Zandi, chief economist of Moody’s Analytics, the organisation that analyses the ADP’s figures. “In addition, because of the tightening labor market, retailers may be accelerating seasonal hiring to secure an adequate workforce to meet holiday demand, although total expected seasonal hiring may be no higher than last year’s,” he continued. In October, during the run up to the presidential election, recruitment figures were below expectations, with 119, 000 new jobs introduced, despite a forecast of 147, 000. The recruitment drive was particularly prominent amongst large and medium sized businesses, which supplied 90, 000 and 89, 000 of the new recruits respectively. The numbers have significantly exceeded original expectations, with economists polled by the Wall Street Journal predicting 170, 000 new jobs in the month of November.
