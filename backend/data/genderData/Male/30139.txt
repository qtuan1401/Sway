In his Friday column, New York Times columnist David Brooks speculates about a new political dichotomy and writes that   Donald Trump will “resign or be impeached within a year. ” [From Brooks’ column:  Finally, it seems important to be humbled and taught by this horrific election result. Trump’s main problem in governing is not going to be some fascistic ideology his main problem is going to be his own attention span, ignorance and incompetence. If he’s left to bloviate while others are left to run the country and push through infrastructure plans, maybe things won’t be disastrous. The job for the rest of us is to rebind the fabric of society, community by community, and to construct a political movement for the   era. I suspect the coming political movements will be identified on two axes: open and closed and individual and social. Those who believe in open believe in open trade, relatively open immigration, an active foreign policy and racial integration. Those who believe in closed believe in protective trade, closed borders, a withdrawn foreign policy and ethnic separatism.   …     Trump’s bigotry, dishonesty and   will have to be denounced. We can’t go morally numb. But he needs to be replaced with a program that addresses the problems that fueled his assent. After all, the guy will probably resign or be impeached within a year. The future is closer than you think. Read the rest here.
