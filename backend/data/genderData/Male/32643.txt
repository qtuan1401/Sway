 (CNN) Federal District Court Judge James Robart in Seattle denied a request from the Trump administration to postpone any further proceedings in his court over President Donald Trump’s travel ban, while the 9th Circuit Court of Appeals considers whether to rehear the case before a larger panel of judges. ”I’m not prepared to slow this down,” Robart said, ruling from the bench. What this means is that the challenge to the travel ban by the states    Washington and Minnesota    will proceed the merits in front of Robart. ”I’m not persuaded that call for en banc review by one judge . .. ought to interfere with moving this case forward, ” Robart said.

Bennett said: ”Yes, your honor.” The Trump administration is reviewing its options, including rewriting or modifying the executive order.
