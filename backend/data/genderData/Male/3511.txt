(Want to get this briefing by email? Here’s the  .) Good evening. Here’s the latest. 1. Donald Trump offered details of his   economic policies in a speech in Detroit. He promised to ease or freeze regulation, limit business income tax to 15 percent, and tear up the Paris climate agreement. He also said he would renegotiate trade agreements, end the estate tax, create jobs and exempt   expenses from taxes. Protesters interrupted sporadically. Watch excerpts here. On the same day, 50 senior Republican national security officials issued a warning that Mr. Trump would be “the most reckless president in American history. ” _____ 2. Hillary Clinton’s campaign criticized Mr. Trump’s economic plans on Twitter: “1. Lower wages 2. Fewer jobs 3. More debt 4. Tax breaks for the 0. 1%. ” She will lay out more of her economic ideas in Detroit on Thursday. Mrs. Clinton is starting the week in Florida, where her campaign is opening more than a dozen offices in hopes of cementing her lead and denying Mr. Trump a state crucial to his own strategy. _____ 3. At the Olympics, the enthusiasm of Brazilian fans has been straining the boundaries of sportsmanship. Still, world records continue to fall. And there was a quieter groundbreaking moment. A    fencer, Ibtihaj Muhammad of New Jersey, was the first U. S. Olympian to compete at a Games in a hijab. And a new athletic fad emerged: Michael Phelps and other swimmers are mottled with circular purple bruises because they are undergoing “cupping,” a technique used in Chinese medicine. It’s reputed, but not scientifically proven, to increase circulation. Our full coverage is here, and you can stream the Games here. _____ 4. Delta Air Lines canceled about 450 flights after the failure of a piece of electrical equipment at one of its Atlanta facilities caused its computer systems to crash worldwide. Aside from the toll on passengers, the airline is grappling with refunds, emergency accommodations and other expenses as yet untallied. Below, handwritten boarding passes. Southwest Airlines estimated its costs from a similar problem a few weeks ago at “tens of millions of dollars. ” _____ 5. Emperor Akihito of Japan raised the possibility of stepping down, a challenge to the cult of emperor worship created in the 19th century. At 82 and with a history of health problems, Akihito effectively urged the country to return to the temporal and temporary leadership of past centuries. _____ 6. Scores of people were killed and many others were seriously wounded in the latest burst of violence in the restive Pakistani city of Quetta. In an attack claimed by a splinter group of the Pakistani Taliban, a suicide bomber struck a hospital where dozens of lawyers had gathered to condemn the fatal shooting of a prominent colleague. _____ 7. Scientists are getting worried about how climate change is drying out peat bogs, making them more vulnerable to fire. Such bogs make up only about 3 percent of the earth’s land surface  —   mostly in northern Canada, Alaska, northern Europe and Russia. But, surprisingly, they contain more carbon than all the world’s trees and plants. _____ 8. Mexico has counted more than three dozen deaths and is still digging out from landslides after   rains from Tropical Storm Earl. One town was hit with a month’s worth of rain over 24 hours. And another big storm is heading toward Baja California and Mexico’s Pacific Coast. _____ 9. One of our most popular stories today looks at the troubling frequency with which corporate consultants double as scholars with think tanks that shape government policy across the political spectrum. For instance, Carol Browner, above, a former top environmental adviser to President Obama, was a paid consultant to the nuclear power industry while she held an unpaid position as a senior fellow at the Center for American Progress. _____ 10. Finally, a wedding in Pennsylvania included a very special guest. The father of Jeni Stepien, the bride, was killed in a robbery 10 years earlier, so she invited the man who received his heart to walk her down the aisle. When the recipient, Arthur Thomas, arrived from New Jersey, he held out his wrist. “I thought that would be the best way for her to feel close to her dad,” he said. “That’s her father’s heart beating. ” _____ Your Evening Briefing is posted at 6 p. m.
