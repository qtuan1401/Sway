” Investors have less to fear with Trump’s drug pricing       talk than they thought because it’s just that  —         talk. ” ’    ’ ’  ’ ’  ’ ’   Trump promised a relaxation of FDA regulations for drug approval    —   a classic capitalist move  —   and suggested that trade   should be the centerpiece of lowering drug pricing, railing   against the ”global price controls” implemented by other   countries. ’ ’  ’ ”   This is Trump’s trademarked line of economic victimhood  —   the   part that sounds good to populists right off the bat, makes   capitalists queasy, and puts our country at risk of a trade war.   It’s becoming more and more clear that Trump sees making threats   and starting fights with other countries as a form of fiscal   policy.  ” ”   And now it’s coming to the drug game, a place where it definitely   won’t work. ” ”   After Trump’s meeting with the pharma CEOs, t ” ’  ’ ’  ’ ’  ’ ’  ’ ’  ’ ’  ’ ’  ’ ’   More importantly, Roosevelt was willing to back up what he said   with real legislation. His bark had bite. ’ ”   These CEOs don’t care about Trump’s bully pulpit. They walked   into that meeting, smiled, nodded, talked about the jobs they   were creating, heard that some deregulation was coming, and   walked away smiling. ” ”   No other concrete policies for actually bringing down drug prices   were actually discussed, and until that’s on the table, they   could lower prices 10% across the board just to make nice and it   wouldn’t mean much. ” ”   As for calling for the FDA to approve more drugs to spur   competition  —   that’s really great and all, until you actually   think of what these companies have been doing. They’ve been   accused of fixing prices. ” ’   Remember, that toward the end of the last year the Obama Justice   Department went after  including     Mylan, for colluding to keep prices high. The   makers of insulin were just accused of doing the same thing in a    This practice is rampant in the   industry and Capitol Hill is just starting to wrap its mind   around it. ’ ’  ’ ”   You know what else drug companies have been doing that they FDA   can’t fix? Paying their way into your healthcare plan. As we   learned through our  drug companies are   more than willing to pay the companies that manage your   healthcare plan to get on lists called formularies  —   formularies   determine what drugs your insurance company will pay for. ” ”   That means a higher priced drug with cheaper competition can find   its way on a list where it really doesn’t belong. It means drugs   that should’ve been crushed by competition in a fair market don’t   actually die a natural death  —   they live on thanks to palms   greased in the system. ” ”   And that’s the problem  —   our system. Not another country’s, not   the FDA’s, the American pharmaceutical industry’s system. Looking   at it any other way ensures you apply the wrong solutions on the   wrong problem. ” ”   That’s because the biggest problem with the industry is all its   own, and it doesn’t require regulation to fix either. It is the   fact that our drug pricing system is incredibly opaque. ” ”   Try telling a pharmacy benefit manager (the people who manage the   lists) to publish a clear list of how it prices everything, what   cut it’s taking, and who is paying for it. Tell drug companies to   do the same. ” ’   Then watch them all have a panic attack. ’ ”   It’s the opacity of the market that allows it to price things the   way it does. Imagine yourself turning on the light in the   bathroom at a remote campsite in the middle of the night. Imagine   that light hasn’t been turned on in about 10 years. Imagine what   you would see. It would be like that. ” ’  ’ ’  ’ ”It’s not how you get things done,   it’s how you get humiliated in public when the President of   Mexico refuses to have a meeting with you. ” ”   Now to be clear, trade wars aren’t good for the pharma industry   either, they just might be better than lowering prices long term   or enacting regulation that forces companies to come clean on how   the sausage is made.  ” ”   There’s nothing scarier than having to show the American people   the inside of the sausage. ” ”Investors have less to fear with Trump’s drug. ..”
