Washington (CNN) President Barack Obama, the 44th commander in chief of the United States, caps off eight years in office on January 20. Those eight years saw the nation grapple with the worst economic disaster since the Great Depression. The country’s response to that crisis helped reshape the economy and the makeup of the political system a few times over. And for every day of those eight years, the nation was at war    on multiple fronts, against multiple groups for multiple purposes. All of these momentous changes during Obama’s presidency had very real effects on people across the country and the globe. And for each of these   impacts, there is a number. CNN Money has charted the Obama economy while The New York Times has explored 2016 in numbers. Here, 44 statistics open a window to the 44th President’s expansive impact. 1. Unemployment, The recession cost many people their livelihood. The following years saw many of those same people gain it back. While part of the drop in unemployment came from people leaving the workforce, enough people have jobs now that, statistically speaking, employment has recovered from the darkest days of the economic crisis. According to the Bureau of Labor Statistics’ seasonally adjusted unemployment rate:  When Obama came into office during January 2009, the unemployment rate was 7. 8%.The highest point in the data set came in October 2009, when unemployment hit double digits at an even 10%. The final unemployment report under Obama put the unemployment rate at 4. 7% for December 2016. 2. Oil, Due in part to a revolution in domestic fossil fuels and massive oil production overseas, oil and gas have been pretty cheap for some of Obama’s presidency.  Here’s what the situation looks like. Barrel of brent crude, January 3, 2017: $55. 47Retail price of a gallon of regular unleaded gas, week of January 2, 2017: $2. 377, 3. The stock market, Following years of upward climb and a rally after   Donald Trump’s electoral victory, stocks are near record highs. Here’s stock market performance as of January 3, 2017: Dow Jones: 19, 881. 76SP: 2, 257. 83Nasdaq: 5, 429. 08, 4.   races, Obama’s election coincided with Democratic victories across the nation and the strong 2008 showing built on the party’s successes in 2006. But as the years went on, the situation virtually reversed itself. Obama will exit office with the Republican Party resurgent on the state and federal levels. Here’s the breakdown for state government, according to the National Conference of State Legislatures: Here’s the breakdown for the US Congress, according to the Senate and House of Representatives. 5. Opioid crisis, Deaths from   overdose deaths have been on the rise. More people are dying from overdoses on heroin and prescription pain medicine like oxycodone and fentanyl. The National Center on Health Statistics and CDC WONDER report the number of   overdose deaths nationwide: 6. Pot laws, States with legal marijuana or cannabis products have blossomed under Obama. When he took office, recreational marijuana wasn’t legal in any state. Here’s what marijuana legalization looks like now, with information compiled by CNN Health: Recreational: 8 states + the District of ColumbiaMedical: 19 statesMedical CBD: 11 states, 7. Medicaid expansion, The Affordable Care Act set aside funding for states to expand Medicaid    a government health care program for the poorest Americans. But the process became something of a tussle with state governments and many of their Republican leaders. By the end of Obama’s presidency, only the slim majority of states had opted to expand Medicaid. The District of Columbia and 31 states expanded Medicaid, per the Kaiser Family Foundation. 8. Insurance coverage, As the economy recovered and the Affordable Care Act, also known as Obamacare, reformed the health care market, more people had health insurance coverage. Here’s the total percentage of people without insurance, according to the US Census Bureau’s American Community Survey: 9. National debt, By the end of Obama’s presidency, government debt had nearly doubled to about $20 trillion. To be specific, the Treasury Department as of January 13, 2017, pegged the total public debt outstanding at $19, 940, 614, 376, 504. 40.  10. Deportation, Trump said during his campaign that he’d create a special force to deport undocumented immigrants. Although Obama criticized Trump’s immigration proposals, he detained and deported millions of men, women and children. Obama’s administration deported the most people    434, 015    in 2013. Here are total ”removals” of people according to the Department of Homeland Security’s 2015 yearbook of immigration statistics (the most recent year for which data are available): 11. Interest rates and inflation, The Federal Reserve increased its interest rate by . 25% in December 2016 for the second time since the financial crisis. The rates had been cut to zero in 2008. Many were concerned the Fed’s easy money policies would cause inflation to skyrocket. Instead, inflation hasn’t risen by much yet for years. Here’s the rate of inflation, per the Minneapolis Fed. 12. The car industry, General Motors (GM) was down to 75 cents a share in May 2009. As of January 3, 2017, GM’s stock was up to $35. 15.  13. Inequality, The US has grown more unequal over the past few decades, including the past eight years.  One commonly cited measure is the Gini index. The number ranges from zero to 1, and the higher the Gini index is, the more unequal the distribution of income is.  According to the Census, it was . 469 in 2009 and . 4817 in 2017. Another way to look at it comes from a recent study by economists Thomas Piketty, Emmanuel Saez and Gabriel Zucman.  The bottom half of earners have seen their   incomes fall while the highest earners have seen a fairly steady rise. 14. Wage gap, Debate abounds over how and why incomes vary by gender and whether the wage gap can fairly be said to exist. However, men and women, as well as people of different races, all have much different pay. Here are the median weekly earnings for employed,   wage and salary workers in 2015, with an overall average of $809, per the Bureau of Labor Statistics. 15.

Here’s annual GDP growth, from the World Bank: 16. Bills vetoed and signed, During Obama’s tenure, he vetoed a total of 12 bills. Only one of those vetoes, the bill that would allow the families of those killed in the Sept. 11, 2001, terrorist attacks to sue Saudi Arabia for any role in the plot, was overridden by Congress and passed into law. Since 2009, 1, 294 bills were signed into law that dealt with everything from the economy to foreign policy to health care, according to GovTrack.  17. Homeless veterans, The Obama administration put forth ”an aggressive strategy to end veteran homelessness” in 2010 as part of its overall plan to combat homelessness in the US.

Police violence  According to reporting done by The Washington Post, 991 people were shot dead by police in 2015.

Job creation, The Obama administration created 11. 3 million jobs in eight years, and the economy added jobs for 75 straight months, a record that totals 6½ years.  More jobs were created under Obama than under George W. Bush, who only created 2. 1 million jobs. However, Obama fell short of Bill Clinton and Ronald Reagan, who saw 22. 9 million and 15. 9 million jobs created, respectively, under their presidencies. 23.

Rounds of golf, Obama hit the links 333 times since assuming the presidency, according to CBS News’ Mark Knoller, the unofficial White House statistician who pledged to track each and every round played by the commander in chief.
