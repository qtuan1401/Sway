Amie Parnes at The Hill reports on Hillary Clinton’s latest complaint about her Republican rival Donald Trump  —   that he and other GOP leaders are launching sexist attacks against her. [From The Hill:  Hillary Clinton is playing the sexist card against Donald Trump and the Republican Party. The Democratic nominee, along with top surrogates and allies, has seized on Trump’s recent comment that Clinton does not have a “presidential look,” using the comment to depict him as sexist. The former secretary of State also laid into Republican National Committee Chairman Reince Priebus for his tweet that she looked “angry” during an MSNBC presidential forum. Clinton didn’t rule out sexism when asked if she was being treated differently in the political race because she is a woman. “I’m going to let all of you ponder that last question,” the first female presidential nominee replied with a grin at a press conference. “I think there will be a lot of Ph.
