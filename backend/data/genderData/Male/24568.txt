After her dramatic chant of Taylor Swift lyrics to challenge Donald Trump, Sen. Elizabeth Warren has turned to a new line of attack against the presumptive Republican nominee. [“I say we throw Donald Trump down the drain,” the Massachusetts Democrat said, referring to Trump’s dismissal of government waste.   Warren made her remarks during a speech at the Center for Popular Democracy. Earlier this month, Trump explained in an interview with George Stephanopoulos that, “they take our tax money and throw it down the drain. ” “I try to pay as little tax as possible,” he said. “And I’ve said that for the last two years, I fight very hard because this country wastes our money. ” Warren appeared furious over Trump’s remarks, suggesting he wasn’t paying his fair share. “For all we know he could be paying zero taxes today and he is proud of it,” Warren complained, accusing Trump of not playing by the rules. She echoed President Barack Obama’s attack that Trump didn’t get wealthy on his own, but rather owed the government more taxes. “Let’s be clear, Donald Trump didn’t get rich on his own,” Warren said, pointing to Trump’s businesses that relied on government services like transportation and law enforcement and even protection by the United States military. “Donald Trump thinks that supporting them is throwing money down the drain?” she said. “Then I say we throw Donald Trump down the drain. ” Warren also described Trump as a “small insecure money grubber” that was “kissing the fannies” of Wall Street bankers. “Donald Trump is worried about helping poor little Wall Street,” she said. “Let me find the world’s smallest violin to play a sad sad song. ”
