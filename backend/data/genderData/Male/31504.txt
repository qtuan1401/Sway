The PGA of America killed the PGA Grand Slam of Golf for good after cancelling it last year because the group scheduled it for a Donald   property. [The PGA of America addressed the end of the    event in a release:  After pulling out of Trump National Golf Club in Rancho Palos Verdes, California in July, a bumbling PGA of America could not schedule the event for another country club in the ensuing months, forcing a cancellation. The group cited controversial comments from the presidential candidate regarding immigration as the reason to break the agreement to hold the event at the Trump property. The event, started in 1979, invited the winners of the Masters, the U. S. Open, British Open, and PGA Championship to compete in an   tournament. The   event offered less in prize money than other events, but with four men competing it enticed the invitees by guaranteeing a solid purse. The money collected there did not count toward the PGA Tour’s money list.
