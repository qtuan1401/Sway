Donald Trump issued a statement following Huma Abedin’s decision to leave her husband, Anthony Weiner, after his latest online sexting scandal. [“Huma is making a very wise decision. I know Anthony Weiner well, and she will be far better off without him. I only worry for the country in that Hillary Clinton was careless and negligent in allowing Weiner to have such close proximity to highly classified information,” Trump stated in a press release on Monday afternoon. “Who knows what he learned and who he told? It’s just another example of Hillary Clinton’s bad judgment. It is possible that our country and its security have been greatly compromised by this. ”  Abedin, who is a friend of the former secretary of state, served as Hillary Clinton’s aide at the State Department, handling classified information. Abedin announced Monday that she is separating from her husband in the aftermath of his falling back into his sexting habit, which has been ongoing, after a New York Post article published on Sunday revealed Weiner trading sexual photos with a woman, one of which included his and Huma’s son in the background. “After long and painful consideration and work on my marriage, I have made the decision to separate from my husband,” Abedin stated. “Anthony and I remain devoted to doing what is best for our son, who is the light of our life. During this difficult time, I ask for respect for our privacy. ”
