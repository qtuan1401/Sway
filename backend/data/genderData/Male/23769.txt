Republican presidential candidate Donald Trump has received an endorsement from the Cleveland Police Patrolmen’s Union in the key battleground state of Ohio. [The union voted overwhelmingly Friday for Trump over Democratic presidential nominee Hillary Clinton in a 216 to 68 vote, WJW reported.  The union usually does not endorse a candidate, but members voted last week to make an endorsement this year by one vote. “The Membership voted by a narrow margin that the Cleveland Police Patrolmen’s Association WILL make an endorsement in the upcoming election for President of the United States,” CPPA President Steve Loomis said in a letter sent to all police union members Wednesday. The national Fraternal Order of Police endorsed Trump for president in September.
