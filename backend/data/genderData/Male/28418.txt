Republican presidential nominee Donald Trump has repeatedly criticized rival Hillary Clinton for her “bad judgment” and warned about the consequences of her top aide’s husband’s online philandering. [On Friday the FBI chose to continue its investigation into Hillary Clinton’s unauthorized, unsecured email server stored in a bathroom closet and used to conduct official state business. Furthermore, the New York Times reported that the FBI had seized devices from top Clinton aide Huma Abedin’s estranged husband, disgraced former Congressman Anthony Weiner, while they investigated his sexting of an underage girl. One official said the new emails related to Clinton’s case numbered “in the tens of thousands. ”  Weiner’s penchant for sexting underage girls and sending them sexually explicit photos of himself now endangers Clinton’s presidential run. Trump hammered Weiner for years before his presidential run, calling him “degenerate” and “sick. ” I knew disgusting and unwanted porn star @REPWEINER was a sleazebag the first time I met him. Thank goodness he was revealed (so to speak).  —   Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) April 19, 2012,  Degenerate former Congressman Anthony Weiner is trying to make a comeback.

Trump (@realDonaldTrump) May 22, 2013,  Last August, Trump also warned Weiner is the weak link that would expose all of Hillary’s emails sent on an unsecured, private server. It came out that Huma Abedin knows all about Hillary’s private illegal emails. Huma’s PR husband, Anthony Weiner, will tell the world.  —   Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) August 3, 2015,  Throughout his presidential campaign, Trump hammered Clinton for keeping Abedin and by extension Weiner on board. “Her No. 1 person, Huma Abedin, is married to Anthony Weiner, who’s a sleazeball and pervert,” Trump said on July 27. “I’m not saying that. That’s recorded history. I don’t like Huma going home at night and telling Anthony Weiner all of these secrets. ” After Weiner got caught sexting an underage girl, Abedin decided to separate from her husband. Trump immediately stated that Clinton showed bad judgment by allowing Weiner “close proximity” to classified information. “Huma is making a very wise decision. I know Anthony Weiner well, and she will be far better off without him,” Trump said in an Aug. 29 statement. “I only worry for the country in that Hillary Clinton was careless and negligent in allowing Weiner to have such close proximity to highly classified information. Who knows what he learned and who he told? It’s just another example of Hillary Clinton’s bad judgment. It is possible that our country and its security have been greatly compromised by this. ”
