Friday on MSNBC’s “Morning Joe,”   Joe Scarborough said   Donald Trump “has been attacked more from more sides, I think than any other President in U. S. history. ”  Scarborough said, “I’m certainly not defending Donald Trump here. I’m saying that Donald Trump, Mika, has been attacked more from more sides, I think, than any other president in U. S. history because he didn’t have a home team. Republicans were attacking him. Conservatives were attacking him. The ones that would usually defend him. Democrats were attacking him. Media was attacking him. He had Sean Hannity and Breitbart and whatever else versus the world. ” Follow Pam Key on Twitter @pamkeyNEN
