The dismal May jobs numbers the Labor Department reported Friday “is unacceptable,” according to Republican National Committee Chairman Reince Priebus. [“This devastating jobs report showing the weakest hiring in five years is the latest indication we need to move away from the failed Obama policies Hillary Clinton is promising to continue,” Priebus said in a statement. “The percentage of Americans in the labor force is the smallest since 1978, and last month 12 times more people gave up looking for work than found a job. ”  The BLS reported that the U. S. economy added a meager 38, 000 jobs last month, as the number of Americans out of the labor force hit a record high of 94, 708, 000. With hundreds of thousands of Americans dropping out of the workforce the labor force participation rate decline 0. 2 percent hitting 62. 6 percent or levels not seen since the 1970s. As Preibus highlighted Friday, the weak report comes days after President Obama touted his economic record in Elkhart, Indiana. “Just this week President Obama was trying to convince Americans they’ve never had it so good, but on his watch wages have remained stagnant, economic growth has slowed to a crawl, and the middle class has continued to shrink,’ Preibus said. Tying the numbers to the presidential election, the RNC chairman highlighted presumptive Republican presidential nominee Donald Trump’s business acumen. “By running on four more years of Obamanomics, Hillary Clinton is guaranteeing that struggling Americans will never get ahead. Donald Trump is a successful businessman who knows what it takes to create jobs and get our economy back on track. As this report makes clear, we need that kind of thinking now more than ever in the White House. ”
