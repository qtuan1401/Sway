Thursday on MSNBC’s “The Last Word,” The Atlantic senior editor David Frum warned of “recriminations” aimed at Republican presidential nominee Donald Trump and his supporters should Trump lose and “lose as big as he’s going to. ”  Frum was skeptical the movement Trump is leading would survive beyond the November election and said the new movement would be made out of opposition to the “Hillary Clinton administration. ” When Donald, should he lose and should he lose as big as he’s going to, there is going to be a scorched earth period of recrimination and Donald Trump will be the target of the recriminations and the people around him will be the target of the recrimination,” Frum said. “And as we discover in the weeks and months after the election how much   there has been in the campaign, how badly the campaign was run, and how even before it was over how everyone was preparing their parachutes and their   strategies. There’s going to be a revulsion in the Republican Party against this crew. I don’t think they’re going to have the clout they imagined they’ll have. ” “Even Organizing For America, President Obama’s extraordinary effort, after it was successful ceased to be powerful,” he continued. “Now imagine how much more true that is going to be if people were unsuccessful. I think we are going to discover we’re in a new terrain with new faces and new personalities and new issues driven by opposition to the agenda of the Hillary Clinton administration should there be one. ” (  RCP Video) Follow Jeff Poor on Twitter @jeff_poor
