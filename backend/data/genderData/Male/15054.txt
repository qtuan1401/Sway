Chief news executives at MSNBC and its parent company NBC reportedly went to war this week over Rachel Maddow’s   big tease of “Trump’s tax returns. “[The alleged    feud was spurred by Maddow’s decision to go live with her “scoop” while leaving   at NBC in the dark, Page Six reports.  “[MSNBC] announced it on Twitter, and [NBC] found out when [the general public] did,” a source reportedly said. “[MSNBC president] Phil Griffin was trying to undermine [NBC News president] Noah Oppenheim,” the source reportedly added. “There was never a conversation. They overplayed their hand in a huge way. ” While an NBC representative said there’s no beef between the network heads, MSNBC’s Griffin made a    statement of superiority as it relates to how Oppenheim got started at NBC. “They’ve been friends for 20 years  —   ever since Phil hired Noah straight out of college to work on Hardball,” the NBC rep said. “They’re super tight. ” Despite the massive buildup, Maddow’s report was one   conspiracy   presentation that ultimately regurgitated what the Trump White House had already revealed  —   that the President paid the IRS $38 million in taxes in 2005.
