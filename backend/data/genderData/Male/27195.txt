Veteran pollster Pat Caddell warns that Ohio Gov. John Kasich’s vote for the North American Free Trade Agreement during his tenure in Congress could cost him both his approval rating as governor and the critical state primary. [“I believe  —   I haven’t gone back and looked  —   but I think he was in Congress in ’93 and if so, I’d bet you he voted for NAFTA. How much do you want to bet? Somebody ought to look that one up. That’s the real point this morning that could change the election in Ohio,” he told Breitbart News executive chairman and host Stephen K. Bannon on Breitbart News Daily Friday morning.  “If he did, as I suspect, vote for NAFTA, he could get killed on this now,” he continued. Caddell warned that voters who saw their state and the nation’s manufacturing core gutted by free trade deals would dump Kasich for Trump. “If Kasich voted for NAFTA and Trump gets a hold of that, he will lose Ohio,” he said. Kasich did in fact vote for the North American Free Trade Agreement in 1993 while serving in the House of Representatives. During a January GOP debate, he also declared: “I’m a  . I supported NAFTA, I believe in the PTT [sic] because it’s important those countries in Asia are an interface against China. ” Kasich also backs President Obama’s trade agenda  —   with disastrous results for the American workers he boasts of protecting. According to analysis from the Economic Policy Institute, “Ohio lost 112, 500 jobs due to the nation’s trade deficit with TPP countries,” as Breitbart News previously reported.
