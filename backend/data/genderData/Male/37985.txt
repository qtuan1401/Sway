 (CNN)  has been the norm this political season, but it’s unclear what salutations Hillary Clinton and Donald will use when they meet    Monday night. Past debates have usually featured a degree of formality and respect above harsh campaign trail rhetoric. Will that hold in 2016? There’s at least some reason to think GOP nominee Trump and Democratic rival Clinton will tone it down Monday, based on some of the nicer ways they’ve addressed each other. Clinton, Trump poised for historic debate battle, Yes, Clinton frequently uses Trump’s last name derisively, as ”Trump.” But she’s just as likely to refer to him to   ”Donald Trump” and sometimes even ”Mr. Trump.” He’s famously tagged former Secretary of State Clinton ”crooked Hillary.” But he also regularly refers to her ”Hillary,” ”Hillary Clinton” and from to time ”Secretary Clinton.” Will one or both reference a past role of their opponent? Say a   compliment from Clinton about a ”reality TV star”? Or will they exude a degree of familiarity by using first names only, with ”Hillary” or ”Donald”? How to address debate opponents has been a stumbling block before for national candidates. In 2008 Sarah Palin, the GOP vice presidential nominee, referred to her Democratic rival,  . Joe Biden of Delaware, as ”Senator O’Biden.” Though she had begun the debate asking if she could refer to him as ”Joe.” Her mistake about his last name proved a fleeting issue.  5 things to watch at Monday night’s   debate, With the power to set a tone, distract from message and help create a memorable sound bite, there could be a lot in a name come Monday evening. Watch the video above for a sampling of how 2016 candidates have referred to their opponents over the past year.
