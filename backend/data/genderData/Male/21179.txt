Following Donald Trump’s victory in the South Carolina GOP primary, talk radio host Glenn Beck urged his Facebook followers to join him and his family in fasting for GOP candidate Ted Cruz. [“I would like to ask you to join me and my family Monday in a fast for Ted Cruz, our country and the Nevada caucus,” Beck wrote on his Facebook page after the South Carolina election results showed a decisive   victory for Trump, whose candidacy Beck has been staunchly opposed to.  In an earlier Facebook post, Beck stated: It was a fair fight. Congratulations Donald Trump on South Carolina. #1. Donald Trump#2. Marco Rubio#3. Ted Cruz, On to Nevada. I will join Ted Cruz in Vegas tomorrow night and Reno Monday. It is time for the others to drop out and make this the 3 way race we all know it is. Who that helps, I don’t know, but it is time to begin to narrow the field. I would assume the establishment will coalesce around Rubio. Ted will make his own way as will trump. Beck endorsed Cruz before the Iowa caucus last month and has been traveling and campaigning with the Texas senator ever since. At a press conference in South Carolina this week, Beck speculated as to whether his presence on the campaign trail “helps Ted Cruz or not,” saying that he didn’t know, but felt compelled to “do everything I can” to help Cruz. This week Beck also expressed his belief that God allowed Supreme Court Justice Antonin Scalia to die in order to “wake America up to how close we are to the loss of our freedom” and to the necessity of electing Cruz to name Scalia’s replacement. Beck also stated that “if the country is lost, it will be lost because of the Christians” who did not support Cruz. “There will be no one else to blame,” he added. “You can’t blame the progressives. You can’t blame the left. You can’t blame Hillary Clinton. You can’t blame anyone else but the Christians who are not living and voting their principles. ”
