’  ’ ’   Bernie Sanders fiercely condemned President Donald Trump on   Monday following  that the president shared highly classified   information with Russian officials during their White House visit   last week. ’ ’   The Vermont senator called Trump’’s actions ”reckless and   dangerous” in a statement released Monday evening. ’ ’   ”President Trump, in a reckless and dangerous manner, has   revealed highly classified information to the Russians at a   meeting in the Oval Office, information that could expose   extremely important sources and methods of intelligence gathering   in the fight against ISIS,” Sanders said in the statement. ’ ’   ”Protecting our national security is one of the most important   tasks a president has, and Trump is failing at it.” ’ ”   Sanders then referenced Trump’s surprise firing of FBI   Director James Comey last week, a move Trump said he made in part   because of Comey’s handling of an investigation into Trump’s ties   to Russia. After the dismissal, Trump issued a cryptic threat to   Comey in which he mentioned the possible existence of   recordings of their conversations, prompting calls for Trump to   release them. ” ’   ”All of this makes it vitally important that Trump make public   any recordings he has of conversations in the Oval Office,”   Sanders said in his statement. ’ ’   Numerous Senate Democrats have joined Sanders in condemning   Trump on Monday.  ’ ”   Details of Trump’s disclosure were first reported by The   Washington Post and subsequently confirmed by Reuters and The New   York Times. ” ’ ’ ’ ’t’t’t. statement on Trump leaking classified intelligence to Russia  ’ ’Bernie Sanders fiercely condemned President. ..’ ’’ ’’ ’’
