’  ’ ’   President Barack Obama said Monday that he believes     Donald Trump is not someone who is stringently   tied to a political philosophy. ’ ’   “I don’t think he’s ideological,” Obama said. “I think   ultimately, he is pragmatic. ” ’ ’   The president, who made his remarks at a press conference in the   White House briefing room, said that quality could “serve him   well. ” ’ ’   Earlier, Obama said Trump was getting ready to assume the   presidency with less “set, hard and fast policy positions” than   most others preparing for the job. ’ ’   The president said it “will be interesting to see what happens”   when Trump takes office, suggesting the reality of various   situations might be at odds with the hardline   rhetoric   Trump championed on the campaign trail. ’ ’   Trump will be inaugurated as the 45th president in January. ’ ’ ’ ’Obama on Trump: ”I don’’t think he is ideological”  ’
