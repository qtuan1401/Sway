’  ’ ’  ’ ’                ’ ’  ’ ’  ’ ’     All of this was a shameful farce, but only Conway’s comments     appear to be . Federal ethics law for     administrative employees says this:   ’ ’     There is simply no question that Conway was endorsing Ivanka     Trump’s product.   ’ ’  ’ ’       Usually, demonstrating official misconduct is more       complicated than this. There are paper trails to examine and       explain, or narrative ambiguities that allow sufficiently       motivated partisans to at least argue that nothing untoward       happened.     ’ ’       Conway’s statement was so clearly and frankly egregious that       it even earned a rebuke from Peter Schweizer, author of        and a       close associate of Trump aide Steve Bannon. “To encourage       Americans to buy goods from companies owned by the first       family is totally out of bounds and needs to stop,” he        the Washington       Post. Larry Noble, general counsel of the Campaign Legal       Center, tells me: “This reminds me a little bit of Donald       Trump’s statement during the campaign that he could shoot       somebody, and nobody could do anything about it. It’s pretty       blatant. ”     ’ ’       It’s so blatant, in fact, that House Oversight Committee       Chairman Jason Chaffetz, a Republican,        on Thursday afternoon that Conway’s behavior was “wrong,       wrong, wrong, clearly over the line, unacceptable. ” He said       that he and Democratic Congressman Elijah Cummings were       sending a letter to the White House and the Office of       Government Ethics asking for an investigation.     ’ ”       Ultimately, though, unless Congress wants to open an       investigation itself, disciplinary action against Conway       would have to come from the White House or the Department of       Justice, and it’s not clear that either would put the law       above loyalty to the Trump family. The Office of Government       Ethics can write a letter recommending some sort of sanction,       but according to Noble, it doesn’t see itself as an       enforcement agency. “The system is based on the assumption       that people are going to want to follow the law or enforce       it,” he says. In 20 days, this administration has exploded       that assumption. “They are   our democracy,”       says Noble. “What happens if the administration just refuses       to follow the laws and Congress doesn’t want to do anything       about it?” We might be about to find out.     ” ’ This is an opinion column.
