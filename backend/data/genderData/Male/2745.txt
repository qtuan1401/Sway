Donald J. Trump proposed another significant shift in American foreign policy on Tuesday, suggesting that as president he would be willing to hold direct negotiations with Kim   the North Korean dictator. In an interview with Reuters, Mr. Trump said that the talks would be part of an effort to halt North Korea’s nuclear program, which the United States considers one of the most serious national security threats. “I would speak to him, I would have no problem speaking to him,” Mr. Trump said. North Korea is among the most isolated countries in the world and regularly defies the international community by launching test rockets and capturing political prisoners. The notion that Mr. Trump would hold direct talks with Mr. Kim could create backlash among Republicans and Democrats. In 2008, Hillary Clinton criticized   Barack Obama for being naïve about foreign policy for expressing a willingness to speak directly with Iran. Senator John McCain, a Republican from Arizona, offered similar criticism of him in the general election. Mr. Trump’s willingness to negotiate with a pariah state comes as he has been offering olive branches to countries such as Russia, which has had tense relations with the United States, while criticizing leaders of traditional allies such as Mexico and Britain. This is not the first time that Mr. Trump has expressed unconventional ideas when it comes to America’s interests in Northeast Asia. In a March interview with The New York Times he suggested that Japan and South Korea should have their own nuclear arsenals so that they would be less reliant on protection from the United States in the region. Direct talks were not the only solution that Mr. Trump proposed on Tuesday when it comes to North Korea. He also told Reuters that he would exert pressure on the Chinese, one of North Korea’s closest allies, to help curb its nuclear ambitions. “I would put a lot of pressure on China because economically we have tremendous power over China,” he said.
