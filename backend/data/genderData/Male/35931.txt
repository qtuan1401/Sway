Washington (CNN) A new Quinnipiac University poll shows Hillary Clinton leading Trump by just two points, 42% to 40% a much closer race than other recent surveys have shown.  With   candidates included, Clinton leads 39% to 37% with Libertarian Party nominee Gary Johnson at 8% and Green Party candidate Jill Stein at 4%.  This Quinnipiac poll is quite different from other recent surveys on the presidential race, showing a much tighter contest than others. Its field period overlaps with those of the Washington   News and NBC News   Street Journal polls released Sunday, both of which found Clinton significantly ahead of Trump.  Nightcap: Trump takes on Clinton  —   and Big Business  —   on trade | Sign up, The difference is primarily in the polls’ estimate of Clinton’s standing in the race: All three found Trump within the margin of error of the other estimates (at 40% in the Quinnipiac poll, 39% in the Washington   News poll and 41% in NBC News   Street Journal poll, no statistically significant differences there). But each of the three polls pegged Clinton’s support as significantly different from the other two polls, with the low at 42% in the Quinnipiac poll, 46% in the NBC News   Street Journal poll and the high of 51% in Washington   News poll. CNN’s latest Poll of Polls, spanning surveys conducted June   has Clinton ahead, 47% to 40%.  Quinnipiac found an alarming statistic: 61% of those surveyed say the 2016 election has increased the level of hatred and prejudice in the United States    compared to just 34% who say it has had no impact.  Of that 61% 67% blame Trump and 16% blame Clinton.  The survey also found a majority of voters    58% for Trump, and 53% for Clinton    said each would not be a good president.  Clinton allies to hit Trump with $13 million in ad spending, ”It would be difficult to imagine a less flattering    reaction to Donald Trump and Hillary Clinton,” said Tim Malloy, assistant director of the Quinnipiac University poll, in a memo accompanying the poll results. ”This is where we are. Voters find themselves in the middle of a     campaign between two candidates they don’t like. And they don’t think either candidate would be a good president.” The poll found a similar gender divide as previous surveys: Clinton wins among women, 50% to 33% while Trump has the advantage with men, 47% to 34%.    He is also ahead by the same margin with white voters, while Clinton wins   voters, 91% to 1% and Hispanic voters, 50% to 33%.
