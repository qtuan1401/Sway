When host Stephen K. Bannon asked Breitbart Daily News caller Ralph from Colorado to choose between even a weak Constitutionalist versus an authoritarian figure for president, even if he felt he authoritarian would do what needed to be done to put the American ship of state right in his view, the caller said he would go with the Constitutionalist every time. [“I don’t want a ruler. Even if he’s a good ruler,” he said.  Calling himself a “free man,” the caller said going with an authoritarian means “we are at the mercy of whoever is in that ruling position. You might have a good ruler for eight years and then you hand it again to someone like Obama, or Bush, who I wasn’t terribly happy with either. You have to get back to the Constitution.
