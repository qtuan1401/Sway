GOP frontrunner Donald Trump’s wife Melania appeared on MSNBC’s Morning Joe on Wednesday and discussed her husband’s campaign, defending his comments on illegal immigration and his support of women. [“I followed the law,” Trump told MSNBC’s Mika Brzezinski when discussing immigration.  I never thought to stay here without papers. I had a visa, I traveled every few months back to the country to Slovenia to stamp the visa. I came back, I applied for the green card, I applied for the citizenship later on after many years of green card. So I went by system, I went by the law. And you should do that, you should not just say let me stay here and whatever happens, happens. Melania was asked whether or not she felt her husband insulted Mexicans when he made comments about illegal immigration and crime during his presidential launch in Trump Tower last June. “We have thick skin, and we know that people will judge him and people will call names. They don’t give him enough credit. From June that he announced, they don’t give him enough credit,” she defended her husband. “He said illegal immigrants. He didn’t talk about everybody. He talked about illegal immigrants,” she reasoned. “And after a few weeks, like two weeks [of] giving him a hard time and bashing him in the media, they turned around. They said, ‘You know what, he’s right. He’s right what he’s talking about.’ And he opened conversation that nobody did. ” She also defended her husband against attacks that he is sexist against women. “They’re treated equal. I see him in life, he treats women the same as men,” she said. “He will tell you what is in his heart, what he thinks. He will not hold it back if you’re a woman, you’re human. If you’re a woman or a man, it’s no different, you’re human. ” “I’m a   mom, and I love it. So, I decided not to be in the campaign so much, but I support my husband 100 percent,” Melania added, referencing her role in his campaign.
