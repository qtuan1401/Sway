.@JoeNBC: This debate is not going to change a whole lot. .. The dynamics of this race remain the same https:  .  Tuesday on MSNBC’s “Morning Joe,” host Joe Scarborough offered his takeaway from the previous night’s presidential debate between Republican presidential nominee Donald Trump and Democratic presidential nominee Hillary Clinton.  According to Scarborough, the debate didn’t do a whole lot to change the race. “I got to tell you  —   here’s my take,” Scarborough said. “This debate is not going to change a lot. Did Donald Trump underperform based on Marquess of Queensberry rules. Perhaps he did. But the dynamics of this race are the same. It’s the change candidate versus the competent insider and I just don’t know that people going to work this morning who want change are going to say, ‘Oh, OK. I’m going to go for the person that, you know, that ticked off the policy prescriptions better than the other. ’” “Donald Trump undercuts all of that by saying, ‘You’ve been othere 35 years,’” he continued. “If you had all of these great ideas, why didn’t you implement them over 35 years?’ That’s just a really strong powerful argument and I don’t know that this debate does anything to change any dynamic. ” Follow Jeff Poor on Twitter @jeff_poor
