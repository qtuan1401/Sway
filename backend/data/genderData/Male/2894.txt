Hillary Clinton had already hit the delegate threshold to secure the Democratic nomination, but cemented her standing with a wins in New Jersey, New Mexico and South Dakota. Bernie Sanders vowed to fight on, hoping a win in California might prompt superdelegates to defect to him. ______ 2. Donald Trump  said his comments about a Hispanic judge  —   suggesting he would not be able to handle a case against the   Trump University fairly because of his heritage  —   had been misconstrued. Mr. Trump spoke after Speaker Paul Ryan, above, called Mr. Trump’s criticism “the textbook definition of a racist comment” and “absolutely unacceptable. ” ______ 3. India’s prime minister, Narendra Modi, goaded by concern over a possible Trump presidency, showcased an unusually cooperative approach on his second visit to the White House in two years. He took crucial steps toward ratifying the Paris climate accord and finishing the purchase of nuclear reactors, with a military deal to come. “Modi wants to get as much as he can out of Obama’s last months in office,” an analyst said. ______ 4. More than 350, 000 people have signed a petition for the recall of a California judge who sentenced this Stanford University student, Brock Turner, to only six months in jail after he was convicted of sexual assault. The victim’s   cry for justice, published after the sentencing, has been viewed more than 8. 5 million times. ______ 5.

Rowling pleaded with fans to keep the plot twists in “Harry Potter and the Cursed Child” secret. The play, which begins at the point where her   series ends, opened in previews in London.

In a rare victory against prison abuses, five New York City correction officers were convicted of all charges in the beating of a Rikers Island inmate in 2012. The inmate testified that he was punched, kicked and stomped, and spat up blood for months. Several more accused officers are to hear their verdict on Friday. “Regrettably, some people think of prisoners as less than human,” said a lawyer. ______ 8. The Syrian president, Bashar   swore to retake “every inch” of territory lost in six years of civil war.

Finally, the cosmologist Stephen Hawking, who suffers from a form of Lou Gehrig’s disease, made a significant addition to his groundbreaking work on black holes.
