’  ’ ”   The Donald Trump campaign on Friday announced a $4 million ad buy   for a   spot aimed at conveying the Republican nominee’s   closing message to voters in the campaign’s final days. ” ’   The ad featured snippets from a previous speech Trump delivered   in Florida in which he argued that establishment politicians do   not have the interest of most Americans at heart. He contended   that his rival, Hillary Clinton, would maintain the status quo,   while he would turn it on its back. ’ ’   Titled “Donald Trump’s Argument for America,” the ad was set to   air in major markets in battleground states. The Trump campaign   said it would also air during NFL, NCAA, and NASCAR programming. ’ ’   ”This is Mr. Trump’’s positive closing message to American voters,   and it comes at a time when Secretary Clinton has abandoned any   positive message of her own,” said Jason Miller, senior   communications adviser. ’ ’   “We believe voters are looking to go in a new direction and Mr.   Trump is ready to lead this change. ” ’ ’ ’
