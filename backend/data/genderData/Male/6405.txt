(Want to get this briefing by email? Here’s the  .) Good evening. Here’s the latest. 1. The meeting between tech executives and   Donald Trump included leaders of some of the world’s most successful companies, including Jeff Bezos of Amazon, above. Three of Mr. Trump’s children attended. What unfolded is less immediately clear  —   the press was quickly ushered out of the room. Mr. Bezos had already made news, announcing that Amazon made its first commercial drone delivery this month, in Britain. _____ 2. A deal to end the brutal assaults on the Syrian city of Aleppo fell through. Artillery shelling resumed, in the latest bitter turn for the thousands of civilians and medical workers unable to flee the ruined city for territory held by the   government. A nurse said he hoped the world would hear “our final scream. ” _____ 3. In Washington, congressional Republicans face a vexing dilemma over Russia. The party’s catechism teaches a tough line on what it calls Russian adventurism, and Republican leaders have been infuriated by evidence of Russian cyberattacks affecting the presidential election and even some House races. But Mr. Trump, who has dismissed the idea that the attacks were in support of his campaign, wants votes for his pick for secretary of state, Rex Tillerson, Exxon Mobil’s chief executive and a longtime friend of the Russian president, Vladimir V. Putin. _____ 4. North Carolina’s bitter election battle is over, but the struggle for control of state government is not. In a surprise special session, Republicans in the Legislature moved to strip the incoming Democratic governor, Roy Cooper, of power over election boards, his own cabinet and many state employees. “It appears this fourth special session will be to nullify the vote of the people,” the leader of House Democrats said. _____ 5. Yahoo disclosed a second enormous hack that compromised user accounts. The company says that 1 billion users were affected and sensitive information may have been obtained. The breach happened in 2013, a year before hackers stole data from 500 million users. _____ 6. The Federal Reserve, citing the steady growth of the U. S. economy, will increase its benchmark interest rate for just the second time since the 2008 financial crisis. The move means that all sorts of expenses  —   including the cost of housing, cars, student loans and even the interest on your credit card  —   will eventually go up. The rate, close to zero for years, remains low by historical standards. _____ 7. “I was really looking for a confrontation, so I could kill. ” That’s what President Rodrigo Duterte of the Philippines  said, boasting that he had personally killed criminals during his time as mayor of Davao City. He is now overseeing a bloody crackdown on drug dealers and users in the country, above. Mexico is also grappling with bloodshed: An increasingly volatile criminal landscape has fueled a surge in homicides, with 17, 063 cases recorded in the first 10 months of this year. _____ 8. The Obama administration issued a rule to stop states from withholding federal funds for health clinics that provide abortions. Federal law already prohibits government financing for abortions, with some exceptions. The new rule is meant to prevent states from cutting off funding to Planned Parenthood affiliates and other groups for unrelated health services. Separately, a new study undermines the claim that women who terminate pregnancies experience emotional and psychological trauma. _____ 9. In yet another jolt to the auction world, the chief executive of Christie’s has decided to step down. Patricia Barbizet, above, will hand the reins to Guillaume Cerutti. The news came just a week after Brett Gorvy, Christie’s top   announced that he would be leaving. Auction houses have been struggling for inventory amid political and economic uncertainty. _____ 10. The legions of bots operating on Twitter may be best known for incessantly spewing spam or insults, but there’s an emerging class of politicized bots taking hold. “You could think of them as ‘protest bots,’” our media critic writes. Some fight disinformation with facts and others are meant to distract trolls. One is identifying every American who donated to Mr. Trump’s campaign. _____ 11. The act of running may not seem to require much thought, but a new study suggests that it enhances cognition. Research shows that for certain cognitive skills, like multitasking and concentration, the brains of competitive distance runners were more finely honed than those of inactive people. _____ 11. Finally, Super Mario is coming to our iPhones (and iPads). The release of Super Mario Run on Thursday means that one of the   games in history (or at least one based on it) can be played on one of the most popular electronic devices in the world. It’s not cheap: $9. 99 for full access. And to limit piracy, it requires a full internet connection. _____ Photographs may appear out of order for some readers.
