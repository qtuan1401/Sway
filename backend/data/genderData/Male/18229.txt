Former Alaska Gov. Sarah Palin endorsed retired Col. Rob Maness for United States Senate on Thursday. [“Louisiana gets to send a worthy fighter  —   a true outsider  —   a champion for the red, white and blue  —   to fight for our country in the US Senate. It’s a privilege to endorse Col. Rob Maness ( ) for US Senate,” Palin posted on Facebook along with a long list of Maness’ achievements.  She adds: Bayou politics are far from boring. Louisiana’s unique “jungle primary” provides a great opportunity for a true outsider like Col. Maness to break through the pack of eight career politicians he’s up against. His opponents have a collective 116 years in office one started as a liberal lobbyist and has been in office since 1988 one is considered among the top Congressional supporters of Palestine one has argued that “we don’t have enough illegal aliens” and another one was a deciding vote for Obamacare. And those are just his fellow REPUBLICANS in the race! Louisiana  —   please send Col. Rob Maness to the US Senate. He’s not a politician. Thank goodness. He has pledged to only serve two terms and is obviously not seeking power or glory. He truly has a servant’s heart. He is a fighter for freedom with a distinguished record to show for it. He has the proven leadership skills Congress so desperately needs. The Colonel’s record of service proves beyond a doubt his strength, wisdom, and love of country. Col. Rob Maness has what it takes to help make America great again. Former GOP presidential candidate Dr. Ben Carson, who has now endorsed Donald Trump, also endorsed Maness.
