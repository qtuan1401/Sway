Donald Trump and Hillary Clinton clashed on terrorism, jobs, race relations and, above all, basic issues of honesty and trustworthiness during their first presidential debate.

I. figures showed homicides skyrocketing 10. 8 percent from 2014 to 2015, the largest   rise since 1968. But most of the country was far safer.
