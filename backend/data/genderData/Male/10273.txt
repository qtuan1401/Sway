But a push within Xi’s government to triple spending on space science as well as the emergence of a small but growing group of privately backed space   suggest that both Chinese industry and government see   economic benefits in their investments in space technologies,” they continued. “That increasing flow of capital toward both China’s   and private   tech companies could place increased pressure on NASA, and eventually on commercial space companies in the United States and Europe. ” CNBC went on to claim that the climate could change with President Trump’s shift of NASA priorities. “Budget disparities aside, many U.
