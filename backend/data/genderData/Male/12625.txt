Sunday  on NBC’s “Meet The Press,” while discussing President Donald Trump’s attacks on the press, Sen. John McCain ( ) said that was “how dictators get started. ”  McCain said, “I hate the press. I hate you especially. But the fact is we need you. We need a free press. We must have it. It’s vital. If you want to preserve  —   I’m very serious now  —   if you want to preserve democracy as we know it, you have to have a free and many times adversarial press. And without it, I am afraid that we would lose so much of our individual liberties over time. That’s how dictators get started. ” He added, “They get started by suppressing free press. In other words, a consolidation of power when you look at history, the first thing that dictators do is shut down the press. And I’m not saying that President Trump is trying to be a dictator. I’m just saying we need to learn the lessons of history. ” Follow Pam Key on Twitter @pamkeyNEN
