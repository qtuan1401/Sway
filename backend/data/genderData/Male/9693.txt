Sunday on CNN’s “State of the Union,” Sen. Cory Booker ( ) said President Donald Trump was creating a “toxic environment” of  “increased fear in our country. ”  Booker said, “This is the problem, I don’t care what party you are in right now, recognize this, we are at a time of increased fear in our country. ” He added, “There is something seriously wrong when mendacity has become the norm. There is something seriously wrong when   citizens are afraid to leave their homes. There is something seriously wrong when hate crimes are surging. There is something seriously wrong when this is a toxic environment being created right now. And I don’t care who you are, if you consider yourself a leader, you have an obligation to stand up and do something about it and lead with love and not appealing to people’s darker angels or exploiting that fear. ” Follow Pam Key on Twitter @pamkeyNEN
