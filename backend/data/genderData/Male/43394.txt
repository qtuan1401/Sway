’  ’ ’   Unabashedly   Trump Twitter personality and online radio   host Bill Mitchell explained his unconventional political views   in an interview with Business Insider at  in Washington, DC. ’ ’   ”I’’m a resultist,” he said. ’ ’   The host of ”Your Voice Radio”  —  distributed mainly   through YouTube and a podcast platform called Spreaker  —     further described himself as not believing in ”    our politics where everything has to fit through a certain   ideological keyhole before you’’ll consider it.” ’ ’   ”I believe in considering all ideas and picking the ones that are   most likely able to get results,” he said. ”Everyone focuses too   much on the front end than on results.” ’ ’   He said he considers himself to be fiscally conservative and   socially moderate, as well. ’ ’’ ’   ”I think the Trump presidency is not going to be about social   issues,” he said. ”Right now social issues is like arguing about   the drapes on the Titanic. We’’ve got a big        inside of the   boat. We need to deal with that first. We need to fix our   deficit, our military spending, we need to enforce our borders,   protect our sovereignty.” ’ ’   Mitchell built up a large online following during the campaign by   tweeting analysis, without much basis, such as suggesting   that polls had missed Trump’’s support and that he was   ”” sure the   magnate would   win the election.
