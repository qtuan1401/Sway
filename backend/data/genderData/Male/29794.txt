Columnist Charles Krauthammer reacted Saturday on Fox News Channel to GOP   Donald Trump winning the South Carolina primary.  According to Krauthammer, Trump cannot be stopped until the bottom three candidates drop out of the race. “Look, the panic ought to be there right now. If you don’t have the field winnowing to three, then I don’t see how Trump is stopped. ” “In a   race, that’s a dead heat with the other two,” he continued. Krauthammer added, “The losing candidates are going to be the ones who have the decisive effect on the trajectory of the campaign. ” Follow Trent Baker on Twitter @MagnifiTrent
