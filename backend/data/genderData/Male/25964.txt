Sunday on NBC’s “Meet the Press,” Democratic presidential   Hillary Clinton said her rival Sen. Bernie Sanders ( ) high polls numbers against the presumptive Republican presidential nominee Donald Trump at this point in the race do not mean anything given Sanders has never had “a single negative ad against him. ”  Partial transcript as follows: TODD: You know, it’s interesting, though. he’s making a case, Bernie Sanders, Senator Sanders, to super delegates, and there’s another memo that they put out this weekend just showing how much stronger he is against Donald Trump than you are. our own poll, he’s got a   lead over trump. you have a   lead over Trump. You made an electability case seven days before the final day of the primary season to super delegates back in 2008. Why shouldn’t super delegates, You wanted them to listen to your argument eight years ago. Why shouldn’t super delegates listen to the Bernie Sanders argument and say maybe he is more electable? CLINTON: Well, first of all, people have voted for me overwhelmingly in the Democratic primary process. and that is absolutely clear, and very different from where we were in 2008. I could make the case, which I did, that I was actually slightly ahead in the popular vote when we ended that primary, but i was behind in the pledged delegates. It’s also fair to say that i have been vetted and tested, and I think that that puts me in a very strong position. TODD: You don’t think Bernie Sanders has been vetted. you don’t think this long campaign has vetted him? CLINTON: Let me say I don’t think he’s ever had a single negative ad against him. That’s fine, but we know what we’re going into and understand what it’s going to take to win in the fall. Finally, I would say that polls this far out mean nothing. They certainly mean nothing to me, and i think if people go back and look, they really mean nothing in terms of analyzing what’s going to happen in the fall. Follow Pam Key on Twitter @pamkeyNEN
