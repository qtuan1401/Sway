Congressman Steve King ( ) appeared on Breitbart News Daily Tuesday morning to support Senator Ted Cruz ( ) in today’s crucial primary elections and to warn that the GOP Establishment is determined to punish Trump and Cruz supporters, and they could even tacitly get behind Hillary Clinton as someone “they can do business with” if Cruz or Trump wins the nomination. [Breitbart News Daily host Stephen K. Bannon noted the nearly complete blackout on Cruz news in this final leg of the primary season, with the exception of Breitbart News and a few other conservative sources, and asked King why the Republican Party seemed so determined to starve Cruz of media oxygen at a crucial moment  —   not to mention their stated determination to fight Trump or Cruz all the way to the convention, no matter how they fare in the primaries.  “We’re going to have something like 70 percent of the vote that comes in here today, and they’re going to be   votes,” King noted, describing the 2016 primary as a “revolt against the Establishment in the Republican Party. ” He said he’s felt the wrath of the Establishment himself, despite striving to give them everything they claim to desire in conservative policies, such as low taxation and regulatory relief.   The problem, said King, is that he gives them more than they really want, such as “        free enterprise, and an American culture and civilization that pulls itself up by its bootstraps, and grows its GDP on a   basis average. ” Ironically, the Establishment’s political and policy failures leave it on the precipice of making a choice between Donald Trump and Ted Cruz, who are likely to be the only candidates left standing after the next two big primary days.  “They’re gonna be thinking: lesser of two evils, what shall we do?” King chuckled.   Unfortunately, as he went on to note, it was no laughing matter that “they may decide they can do business with Hillary, and they might take their big bucks and go home. ”  He thought some Establishment figures and their supporters might actively support Clinton against their own party’s nominee, if it turned out to be Trump or Cruz. “I say that because I’m watching them throw a tantrum right now in Iowa, and they have put, I will say, millions of dollars on the table to recruit a primary opponent against me, because they are sore losers in the Iowa caucus,” King explained.  “When Cruz won the Iowa caucus, they decided, we’re going to teach Steve King a lesson. ”   “Well, I don’t learn very easy,” King promised his Establishment adversaries.  “There’s part of me that just says, let’s get it on. ”   As Bannon noted, that’s just what Andrew Breitbart would have said.  Tuesday marked the fourth anniversary of Breitbart’s death, prompting King to reflect on his old friend’s legacy. “I’m just watching how much impact the Breitbart networks have had, on our politics and our society.  It’s a   place, and I know that Andrew’s up there, smiling down at you and everybody that’s part of the Breitbart team, and I consider myself to at least be part of the extended family of the Breitbart team,” he said.
