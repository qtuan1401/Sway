On this weekend’s broadcast of “Fox News Sunday,” Republican National Committee chairman Reince Priebus downplayed a New York Times report on how presumptive Republican presidential nominee Donald Trump has allegedly treated women.  Priebus said “We’ve been working on this primary for over a year and I’ve got to tell you, I think that all these stories that come out, and they come out every couple weeks, people just don’t care. I think people look at Donald Trump and Hillary Clinton and say who is going to bring an earthquake to D. C. ” He added, “But I don’t think Donald Trump and his personal life is something that people are looking at and saying, ‘Well I’m surprised he’s had girlfriends in the past.’ That’s not what people look at Donald Trump for. I think the traditional playbook and analysis really don’t apply. ” Follow Pam Key on Twitter @pamkeyNEN
