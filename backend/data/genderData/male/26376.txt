A full two months after the incident, but on the same day as Thursday’s Fox Business debate, Jeb Bush released a 60 second ad defending New York Times reporter Serge Kovaleski from Republican frontrunner Donald Trump. The ad is titled “Enough” and opens with a clip of Bush telling a (small) gathering of supporters, “I’ve got to get this off my chest  —   Donald Trump is a jerk. ”  The ad then cuts to photos and videos of the   governor hugging a number of disabled people. Bush buttons the ad up with, “When anybody  —   anybody  —   disparages people with disabilities, it sets me off.  That’s why I called him a jerk. ” Trump denied mocking the reporter’s disability during a campaign appearance.  —    —   Other than being incredibly late (“The  ” might have been a better title than “Enough”) on what planet does Jeb Bush believe anyone still cares about this? What election is he taking part in  —   one where Republican voters are panting to the see our candidates defend elite members of the corrupt media? Maybe in the sequel, Bush can swoop in three months later to defend Univision’s detestable Jorge Ramos from Trump. He can title that one “Finito!”   Follow John Nolte on Twitter @NolteNC
