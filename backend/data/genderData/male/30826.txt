The hacker Guccifer 2. 0 has had his Twitter account suspended after he successfully hacked servers from the Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee (DCCC). [The hack, which revealed information such as personal cell phone numbers and email addresses of senior Democrats and Congressmen as well as information from Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi’s private computer, was another blow to the Clinton campaign after Wikileaks released over 19, 000 emails from the DNC which revealed their tactics in trying to derail the Sanders campaign.  However despite not punishing Wikileaks for their revelations, Twitter has decided to suspend the Twitter account of Guccifer 2. 0, the individual behind latest hack, who accused the DNC of “settling everything behind the scenes. ” Twitter has become notorious for its its liberal bias under the direction of CEO Jack Dorsey, as well as its growing disdain for conservative media. Alleged political bias at the company recently flared into a major issue again after the recent permanent suspension of Breitbart Tech editor Milo Yiannopoulos. However it is one of many tech companies, including Facebook and Apple, who according to a recent Observer   are actively colluding in order to prevent a Trump presidency.
