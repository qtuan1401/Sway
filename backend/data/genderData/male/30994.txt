Republican presidential candidate former Florida Governor Jeb Bush argued that “banning all Syrian refugees” is “a good position” and that fellow candidate Donald Trump has “gone from saying we need to accept Syrian refugees, to banning all Syrian refugees,  …    to banning all Muslims” on Tuesday’s “Happening Now” on the Fox News Channel.  Jeb said, [relevant remarks begin around 2:00] “[T]ake Syria, for example, in a matter of two months, he’s gone from saying we need to accept Syrian refugees, to banning all Syrian refugees, which is a good position, to banning all Muslims, which is a horrible position. And he’s taken the position that we don’t have a dog in the fight, as it relates to ISIS. Then he says, let Russia deal with ISIS. Then he says, let ISIS take out Assad. And now he’s  —   wants to bomb the you know what out of ISIS, all of which shows a lack of seriousness, and we’re in serious times, and I think we need someone with a resolve and a steady hand. And ultimately, the reason why 30 or 40 or 50 percent of primary voters and caucusgoers make up their mind at the last moment, is they’re electing a president of the United States, and they want someone to sit behind the big desk that knows what he’s doing.
