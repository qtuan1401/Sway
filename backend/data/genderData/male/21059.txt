  billionaire Mitt Romney appealed to the frustrations of the #NeverTrump clique Friday at his exclusive   retreat in the Utah mountains. [“I don’t want to see   racism” Romney told CNN. “I don’t want to see a president of the United States saying things which change the character of the generations of Americans that are following. Presidents have an impact on the nature of our nation, and   racism,   bigotry,   misogyny, all these things are extraordinarily dangerous to the heart and character of America. ”  Romney is hosting the conference at the Stein Erickson Lodge Deer Valley in Park City, with about 300 guests including   activist Ana Navarro, who told The Washington Post, “I am not expecting we will sit by the campfire singing ‘We Shall Overcome’ and  . Mitt Romney and other   leaders can have a big influence on the reconstruction of the   Republican Party. We need to start those conversations now. ” Romney famously alienated large   of the American public during his failed 2012 presidential run, in which he insulted 47 percent of his countrymen, challenged a primary opponent to a   dollar bet, spoke of evaluating “binders full of women” when hiring people, and in general came across as indifferent to and unaware of the concerns of   Americans. Various #NeverTrump commentators and fading consultants, chastened by their primary defeat, have accused Trump supporters of being racists or misogynists, sounding much like the   social justice warriors that they claim to oppose. Ryan  GOP leaders supporting Trump are giving credence to Dem claims that the GOP is racist. GOP can’t survive this https:  .   —   Cheri Jacobus (@CheriJacobus) June 9, 2016,
