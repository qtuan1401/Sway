’  ’ ”   Longtime Hillary Clinton backer David Brock offered some debate     to both Clinton and her opponent, Donald Trump, in the     to Monday night’s presidential debate. ” ’   During an interview on CNN on Monday, a panel of political   experts including the founder of Correct The Record, a top super   PAC backing Clinton, offered a series of cheesy   that   both candidates could use during the debate to grab attention. ’ ”   When it was Brock’s turn to rattle off a zinger, he offered   advice to both presidential nominees, telling Clinton to   emphasize Trump’s   ties to Russia, and advising   Trump to highlight Clinton’s relationship with rich campaign   donors. ” ’   ”For Hillary, I’’d say, ’’A vote for you is a vote for the ISIS   terrorists and Vladimir Putin,’’ and then open up both of those   issues. Open up on investments from Russia. I think that would be   effective,” Brock said. ’ ’   He added: ”For Trump I’’m going to give an objective answer. I   think he should say, ’’Hillary, you’’re bought and paid for. You   even came to my wedding because I gave you money. ’’” ’ ’’ ”   Brock’s transition from Clinton antagonist to staunch defender is   . ” ”   Brock, the founder of the liberal watchdog group Media Matters   for America, once dedicated much of his journalistic efforts to   exposing elements of former President Bill Clinton’s extramarital   affairs, but experienced a change of heart about both Clintons   and has since become an outspoken political ally of the former   president and former secretary of state. ”
