A billboard off   in Texas is sparking debate among Austin’s citizens. [The is seemingly targeting illegal immigrants by asking them to join the dating site ArrangementFinders. com to avoid deportation, KEYE reports.  The sign reads, “Undocumented Immigrant? Before You Get Deported, Get a Sugar Daddy. ” The sign is just off Highway   near Frontage Road. Jacob Webster, the online site’s chief marketing officer, told KEYE that he decided to run the ad “in response to Donald Trump’s promise to deport all 11 million of the nation’s undocumented immigrants. ” “ArrangementFinders. com skews heavily towards Hispanic women, with that demographic making up more than 31 percent of all the females on our site nationally and over 53 percent in Austin,” Webster said. The company was started in 2009 and now boasts 3. 9 million members from the U. S. Canada, UK, and Australia. Though ArrangementFinders. com may have had no racist intent, many are still questioning the message. “Could have used another undocumented person. Not just Hispanic people are undocumented,” one commenter on KEYE’s Facebook page said. “But when the word immigrant is said   …     automatically a Hispanic is pictured.   …     Why is that?” “Why is it only a Hispanic girl? Not just Mexicans are here illegally,” another commenter said.
