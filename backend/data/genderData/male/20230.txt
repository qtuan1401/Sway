Monday on MSNBC’s “Andrea Mitchell Reports” while discussing Republican presidential nominee Donald Trump’s immigration policy, conservative commentator and author of “In Trump We Trust: E Pluribus Awesome!” Ann Coulter said Trump has been consistent “really pretty much from day one” on immigration.  Coulter said, “I think he has been consistent, really pretty much from day one. He’s going to protect the borders and not dissolve, you know, American sovereignty. I think he actually —  the only thing —  he was totally consistent this week in all of his speeches. There was the one interview on ‘Hannity’ where we got into the weeds on the hard cases that we get sick of all legislators obsessing over. ” She added, “The basic principle is build the wall and no one here illegally, staying here, working illegally has a constitutional right to be here and we’ll decide who gets to stay and who goes on the basis of what’s good for America. I mean, the one thing, he’s new to politics in some ways, on details, and often rhetorical issues, but the one thing that’s he’s shot through with is putting Americans’ interests first. ” Follow Pam Key on Twitter @pamkeyNEN
