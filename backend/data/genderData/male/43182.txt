’  ’ ’    ’ ’  ’ ’     The theme of Obama’s first term, when it came to Russia, was     “reset”: an attempt to normalize relations after the heightened     tension of the Bush years, which ended with Russia’s 2008     invasion of Georgia. The theme of the second, as relations     between Washington and Moscow deteriorated sharply following     Vladimir Putin’s return in 2012, has been dismissal bordering     on mockery. The only thing we have to fear from Russia, the     president seemed to argue, is the fear of Russia itself.   ’ ’     Obama had been sounding this note since his race for       when Mitt Romney made what was at the time     considered a gaffe by calling Russia America’s “No. 1     geopolitical foe. ” On a  in October 2012, Obama said that the 1980s were     “calling to ask for their foreign policy back because, you     know, the Cold War’s been over for 20 years. ”   ’ ’     Obama first  the “Russia     doesn’t make anything” line in a 2014 interview with the     Economist, as civil war was raging in Eastern Ukraine:     “I do think it’s important to keep perspective. Russia doesn’t     make anything. Immigrants aren’t rushing to Moscow in search of     opportunity. The life expectancy of the Russian male is around     60 years old. The population is shrinking. ”   ’ ’       The              argument was never quite convincing, and not just because       “oil, and gas, and arms” are some awfully valuable       commodities —  mighty global empires have been built on far       less. Does Obama, who has been an eloquent exponent of his       own nation’s lofty ideals, really measure a nation’s       greatness by the quality of the products it exports? When he       talks about Russia, the president has sounded, ironically,       like a 1940s Soviet apparatchik boasting of the USSR’s       superior grain yields, or even Sacha Baron Cohen’s Borat —  the       apotheosis of Western media derision of the         world —  bragging in song about how “other countries have       inferior potassium. ”     ’ ’  ’ ’       In 2014, the line at least had the air of dismissive       confidence about it. In 2016, when Obama repeated it, Russian       jets were in the process of laying waste to Aleppo, Syria,       effectively ending the internationally backed rebellion       against Bashar  ’s government, leaving the U. S. and       its allies little to do but issue statements of concern and       condemnation. (Two weeks later, Russia and Turkey  a new         deal in Syria, which appears for now to be       holding, without any input from Washington.)     ’ ’       Officials at Obama’s own intelligence agencies were telling       reporters at the Washington Post and New York       Times that Russia had deliberately interfered in the       U. S. presidential election to undermine his preferred       successor, Hillary Clinton, and help elect an unqualified and       suspiciously   candidate who threatens to reverse       much of the president’s legacy. With Russia demonstrating its       new clout everywhere from the Black Sea to the Great Lakes,       it seemed dangerously out of touch to depict its manifest       power as a paranoid delusion.     ’ ’         Admittedly, this wasn’t how it was supposed to happen.         While many Americans, likely including Obama himself, have         long accepted that the United States’ post  —  Cold War moment         as the world’s sole superpower wouldn’t last indefinitely,         the challenge to American hegemony on everyone’s mind was         always dynamic, hyperproductive China, or perhaps rising           powers like India or Brazil. Russia was         the past, a land of, yes, rusting factories and declining         life expectancies, where the people are brainwashed by         propaganda and led by a cartoonish strongman president.         Russia was not supposed to be an indispensible nation in         global affairs in the year 2017.       ’ ’         And yet, for all that the U. S. president and American         commentators dismissed that notion throughout Obama’s         second term, the events of the past year have proved that         Russia has become exactly that. Against all expectation,         relations with Russia have dominated the Obama         administration’s foreign policy, right up through last         week, when the president issued sweeping sanctions, in         retaliation for Russia’s election meddling, that belied the         blithe tone of his previous remarks. Relations with the         renascent superpower are likely to dominate the next         president’s term as well —  in ways we’re only beginning to         fathom.       ’ ’           There’s a   story about a young Vladimir Putin           and a cornered rat. He tells it in            the short autobiography published after he assumed the           presidency as a relative unknown in 2000. Living in a           communal apartment with his family in a poor area of             St. Petersburg, young Vladimir and his           friends liked to chase rats in the building’s stairwell:         ’ ’           The story stands out as a rare moment of vulnerability in           an autobiography that’s otherwise largely a catalog of           personal and professional triumphs. The notion of a weak,           cornered creature turning the tables on his tormentor           clearly stuck with him. Perhaps it’s not a coincidence           that soon afterward, a young, aimless Putin found purpose           in judo, a discipline premised on finding ways to exploit           a stronger opponent’s weaknesses.         ’ ’ cited the rat           story as a glimpse into the making of the Russian           president’s worldview. Putin’s Russia, in this reading,           is the rat: Cornered by U. S.  efforts to promote           democracy in its region (efforts Russians view as thinly           veiled attempts at regime change) and by an arrogant           Western attitude that asks Russians to accept that their           days as a significant player on the world stage are long           past. The rat, rather than accepting its fate, lunges at           its tormentors.         ’ ’  ’ ’             It is a useful parable when considering how Putin has             wielded his power. For all the Americans who have             underestimated him, an equal if not greater number have             overestimated him, seeing in the events of the             past few years evidence of a brilliant strategist             thinking multiple moves ahead of his opponents.           ’ ’             Once it was   like Ted Cruz for playing chess while Obama played checkers             in Syria. Today, it’s  who see in             Trump’s victory a grand,               conspiracy. But Putin’s Russia has traditionally             reacted to global events rather than actively shaping             them.           ’ ’             Whether he was sending in troops to “protect” Russian             minorities in Georgia’s breakaway enclaves in 2008             after that country elected an   government,             giving refuge to an    Edward Snowden in 2013,             seizing on the Obama administration’s reluctance to             attack the Syrian regime over its use of chemical             weapons to cut a favorable deal for Assad, or taking             advantage of chaos following the 2014 ouster of             Ukrainian President Viktor Yanukovych to annex Crimea,             few leaders have proved more adept at seizing the             opportunities presented to them. What many Russia hawks             in the U. S. often fail to recognize is that, from             Russia’s perspective, these moves are parries, not             attacks. The thing about the rat story is, if you don’t             look at how the incident began, all you see is a big             rat chasing a skinny, little blond boy down a             stairwell.           ’ ’               Indeed, Americans and Russians hold profoundly               different views of the country’s   history.               In his 2016 book,  the journalist Arkady Ostrovsky               reflects on the euphoria that he felt upon the               collapse of the Soviet Union. “For me, the shortages               of food in the shops were fully compensated by this               exhilarating new sense of possibility. History was               being made in Moscow, and we were in the middle of               it. Looking back at that period, I realize now that               this sense of excitement was experienced by a narrow               circle of people. For the majority of the population,               the collapse of the Soviet Union was associated with               uncertainty and a sharp decline in living standards. ”             ’ ’               American impressions of this period have also been               colored, to a disproportionate extent, by how               educated,     liberals               like Ostrovsky reacted at the time, rather than by               the experience of the majority of Russians. Putin’s                              that the collapse of the USSR was the “greatest               geopolitical catastrophe” of the 20th               century is often trotted out by American hawks as               evidence of irredentist impulses and a blinkered view               of his own country’s tragic history. But it’s not out               of step with the views of many of the people he               governs, however autocratically.             ’ ’               To understand Russia’s current posture, it’s               important to understand how the events of the past 25               years have looked from the country’s perspective. The               rapid transition to   capitalism advocated               by Western economists, the “color revolutions”               championed by Western governments, the expansion of               NATO into formerly communist countries in Eastern               Europe, NATO intervention in the Balkans, the               lectures on human rights and democracy from                 nongovernmental organizations in               Moscow: All are viewed as attempts to undercut               Russian power and stymie its interests.             ’ ’  ’ ’               This in no way justifies Russia’s policies under               Vladimir Putin, domestic or foreign. Russia’s               neighbors should get to decide for themselves whether               they want closer economic or military ties with               Europe and the United States. Support for civil               society groups is not the same thing as regime               change. NGOs, activists, media outlets, and               opposition parties in Russia should have the right to               operate freely, and the U. S. should have no qualms               about saying so. But understanding that Russia has               viewed itself as operating from a defensive crouch               for 25 years is necessary for talking about how it               will operate now that it’s recovered some of its                 swagger.             ’ ’                 Russia is neither a dysfunctional basket case nor                 is it an   shaper of global events. At                 least until recently, it’s been a country with a                 keen sense that its interests were imperiled by the                 West and a cagey knack for exploiting opportunities                 to reclaim former prerogatives. In just the past                 few years, it has managed to enter two wars, in                 Ukraine and Syria, that its rivals saw as                 unwinnable quagmires and, with relatively little                 money or manpower, to reassert its power in old                 spheres of influence.               ’ ’                 What has changed in the past year is that Russia is                 no longer just defending its interests —  it’s                 expanding them. Examples of Russia’s growing clout                 are not confined to its traditional “near abroad”                 in the former Soviet countries or even its former                 client states. Take the recent OPEC meeting, where                 Putin played intermediary between Iran and Saudi                 Arabia  to cut production. Take Japan, which                 has spent years disputing Russian claims to the                 Kuril Islands —  a bit of leftover business from the                 end of World War II —  but agreed this year to most of                 Russia’s demands,  for joint economic activity on                 the islands. Even Benjamin Netanyahu of Israel, not                 exactly a traditional friend of Moscow, has                 .               ’ ’                   Russia’s military forces have been  and in the increasingly contested                   Arctic, its presence is approaching parity with                   its . Politically, Russia has won a                   beachhead in the European Union through its                   support for a number of   parties,                   including Austria’s Freedom Party, whose leader                    at the Kremlin last                   week.                 ’ ’                   A  from                   the   Center for the Study of                   Democracy in October argued that in several                   Eastern European countries, including Bulgaria,                   Hungary, Latvia, Serbia, and Slovakia, “Russian                   influence has become so pervasive and endemic                   that it has challenged national stability as well                   as a country’s Western orientation and                     stability. ” And, of course, Putin                   achieved something the Soviet Union could only                   have dreamed of: influencing, if not outright                   altering, the results of a U. S. presidential                   election in its own favor.                 ’ ’  ’ ’                   These gains notwithstanding, it remains a mistake                   to overstate Russia’s power. There are limits to                   what it can accomplish. Despite having annexed                   Crimea and made the Donbass region of Eastern                   Ukraine essentially ungovernable for the                   foreseeable future, Putin’s original goal of                   bringing Ukraine as a whole back under Russia’s                   thumb looks hopeless, with Kiev’s elites more                     than ever. His longtime plan for a                   Eurasian Economic Union has been severely                   weakened by Ukraine’s absence. A Collective                   Security Treaty Organization meant to rival NATO                   . And as last month’s assassination                   of its ambassador to Turkey showed, the                   bombardment of Syria hasn’t exactly made Russia                   safe from terrorism. Russia may control Crimea,                   but no other country recognizes that control. The                     breakaway regions of Georgia —                     Abkhazia and South Ossetia —  are recognized only by                   the unlikely coalition of Venezuela, Nicaragua,                   and Nauru. Russian reserves of soft power are                   clearly still lacking.                 ’ ’                   But as we’ve seen again and again in recent                   months, the U. S. can’t exactly impose its will                   whenever and wherever it likes either. Russia’s                   not omnipotent —  no country ever is —  but in its                   foreign policy it is acting like a global power                   broker, and doing so effectively. It has an                   ideological underpinning, in the revived doctrine                   of                    which asserts that Russia’s status as an imperial                   power is a natural outgrowth of its geographical                   position between Europe and Asia. It has a                   tactical modus operandi in the techniques of                   “,” which include covert military                   action, media manipulation, political pressure,                   and diplomatic clout. It is even playing an                   increasingly influential role at the U. N. on                   everything from  to . If Russia is not a superpower today,                   no country is.                 ’ ’                     The Obama administration and its allies in                     Europe are clearly aware of Russia’s growing                     influence, but they still seem to expect the                     bottom to fall out from under Putin. And not                     unreasonably: Obama’s dismissive assessments of                     Russia’s domestic situation aren’t exactly                     wrong. The country’s economy is built                     on a flimsy foundation and is overly                     dependent on energy exports. It’s mired in its                      the country’s                     poverty rate is at  and consumers seem to be . It was reeling from low                     global oil prices even before the U. S. and                     European Union applied sanctions over the                     events in Ukraine. In a grim indication of the                     level of desperation, nearly 50 people were                     killed in one Siberian town last month after                      hoping for a cheap buzz. As I myself                      Russia                     shouldn’t have been able to carry on in the                     face of international isolation so long.                   ’ ’                     “Russia’s actions in Ukraine and the sanctions                     that we’ve already imposed have made a weak                     Russian economy even weaker,” Obama said in                     June 2014. “Foreign investors already are                     increasingly staying away. . .. Projections for                     Russian economic growth are down to near zero. ”                     That December, when the ruble saw its largest                     decline since 1998, the New York                     Times’ Paul Krugman  “talk                     of a new cold war, comparisons between Putin’s                     Russia and the USSR, look a bit silly now,                     don’t they?”                   ’ ’  ’ ’                     Two years later, his column looks a bit silly.                     It would be fair to say that sanctions were                     “working” if the criteria for success were                     taking a bite out of the Russian economy and                     immiserating Russians. But the goal is to alter                     Putin’s behavior, to “” as Obama put it, and by that                     criteria, they have failed. The outgoing                     administration responded last week to Russia’s                     alleged election hacking in much the way it has                     to provocations heretofore: more sanctions,                     this time accompanied by the expulsion of 35                     diplomats. The actions seem unlikely to change                     Russian behavior any more so than previous,                     comparable measures.                   ’ ’                     What Obama has failed to appreciate is that                     Russia values its geopolitical position more                     than its economic security. And that’s not                     merely the position of its leader. Putin’s                     approval rating  according to the independent                     Levada Center. A Pew Survey last year showed                     that Russians are well aware that the Russian                     government’s actions in Ukraine have dampened                     international views of their country and have                     hurt the economy,  of them supported those actions.                   ’ ’                       Most Americans would not be willing to accept                       economic conditions akin to Russia’s in                       exchange for, say, a more effective Middle                       East policy. Obama was elected in part on the                       promise of reducing his country’s                       global footprint in order to focus on                       domestic priorities, so it’s perhaps not                       surprising that his administration has had a                       hard time grappling with the fact that                       Russians want a greater global footprint even                       if it comes at the expense of domestic                       prosperity.                     ’ ’                       What accounts for the difference? Some                       political scientists have observed that                       Russians exhibit a  during                       times of war and crisis than citizens of                       other countries. Ostrovsky argues that Russia                       is an “  country,” where abstract                       concepts like Russia’s historical destiny and                       cultural identity play a particularly                       important role in politics, even at the                       expense of    policy. Putin’s                       embrace of religious conservatism since his                                              and rhetoric that  in a historical tradition                       that reaches back farther than the Soviet                       Union to the earliest days of Russian empire                       have given the people a compelling narrative                       to believe in their country again. Whatever                       the reasons, Putin has encouraged Russians to                       back an expansionist and aggressive foreign                       policy, despite the costs. He promised to                       make Russia great again, and —  by a certain set                       of criteria —  he is delivering.                     ’ ’  ’ ’                         What happens next is not clear. In the near                         term, Russia’s run of                           success seems likely to continue. After the                         fall of Aleppo, the election of an American                         president who sees the Syrian conflict the                         same way he does,  Russia                         will continue to have inordinate influence                         on the conflict in Syria. If we assume that                         Trump will indeed pursue a more                           foreign policy, this may encourage former                         Soviet countries, in Central Asia, for                         instance, to move  given that the United                         States is less likely to induce them to do                         otherwise.                       ’ ’                         While other countries are unlikely to                         formally recognize Russia’s annexation of                         Crimea, no one’s going to seriously                         challenge it, and the peninsula will                         increasingly be treated as de facto Russian                         territory. The   coalition that                         developed in the European Union in response                         to the Ukraine crisis also looks set to                         fracture: Next year’s French election is                         likely to bring to power either the                           François Fillon or the even                         more   Marine Le Pen. The                             meddling in the U. S.                         election is a model that has been and can                         be replicated in important races around the                         world.                       ’ ’                         But there are new dangers for Putin as                         well. The forward momentum of his                         nationalist project requires more “. ”                         The   Baltics are probably too                         high stakes, despite Trump’s  about defense commitments.                         Perhaps Belarus’ improving relations with                         the West could provide  or he could  for the                           population in Moldova’s breakaway                         Transnistria region, but conflicts with the                         symbolic importance of Crimea or the                         geopolitical stakes of Syria don’t come                         along every day. At a certain point, Putin                         will start to face real pressure about                         conditions at home —  or he’ll bite off more                         than he can chew abroad, in a play for one                         more rally around the flag.                       ’ ’                         Trump’s election may also be a mixed                         blessing. It’s  that the current romance                         between the two leaders will continue                         indefinitely. The  ’s oddly                         enthusiastic endorsement of an arms race                         last month  where the two powers could                         still butt heads. But if we assume that in                         the near term at least, we will have a                         dramatically more   president of                         the Untied States, and of maybe several                         Western European countries as well, this                         could deprive Putin of a key element of his                         narrative: that he is merely fighting back                         against Western encroachment. Russians were                         willing to forgo groceries to support                         Putin’s wars when they believed the country                         was fighting for survival. That might be a                         tougher sell if the White House is giving                         the Kremlin carte blanche.                       ’ ’                         Over the past several years, we’ve seen                         Putin’s government operate with remarkable                         success from a defensive posture, fighting                         to protect what it sees as its interests                         and to maintain its relevance on the world                         stage. But we’ve only begun to see him act                         from a position of unquestioned power and                         influence. This is a dangerous and                         unfamiliar position for the United States,                         but also for Putin. After all, the rat                         didn’t catch young Vladimir. It got a door                         slammed in its face.                       ’
