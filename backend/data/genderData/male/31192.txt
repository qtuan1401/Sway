Former Texas Gov. Rick Perry is endorsing Republican presidential candidate Sen. Ted Cruz ( ). [Perry, who was also a candidate in the presidential race, tells Politico he thinks that the race for the Republican nomination has now come down to real estate mogul Donald Trump and Cruz.  “Of those individuals who have a chance to win the Republican primary, at this juncture, from my perspective, Ted Cruz is by far the most consistent conservative in that crowd,” Perry said in an interview with Politico. “And that appears to be down to two people. ” From Perry’s interview with Politico: “You’ll have with Ted Cruz that same result of, senators and others in the Washington establishment that are mad at him, find him to be hard to work with, they will find a way to work with him because they know he means what he says he means,” he said. “Gov.
