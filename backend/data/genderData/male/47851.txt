’    ’ ’  ’ ’ Malcolm Gladwell is angry, and he wants you to know why. ’ ’ That’’s not to say that the bestselling author walks around in   a rage all day  —   he’’s actually quite collected and     most of the time, and ready to make a joke. But in his new hit   podcast ”,” he explores certain topics in a way that readers of   his books ”” and ””   may find surprising. ’ ” Take, for example, the way he devotes three episodes to ways   he considers the United States’ education system is failing     students. To him, it’s a subject worthy of nothing   less than moral outrage. ” ’ We recently sat down with Gladwell to discuss what he wants   to achieve with his podcast  —   which he confirmed has been   approved for a second season  —   and how his worldview has evolved   since the massive success of ”The Tipping Point” launched him   into pop culture 16 years ago. ’ ” We also discussed two of the biggest stories in America   today, the presidential election and the public’s relationship   with the police. ” ” When he got mad about a perceived injustice he was talking   about, he’d raise his voice and throw up his hands, but often   before cracking a smile, enjoying the energy of the   discussion. ” ’ This interview has been edited for length and clarity. ’ ’Richard Feloni: With ”Revisionist History,” what   are you finding that you can do with the podcast medium that you   can’’t do with a book? ’ ”Malcolm Gladwell: There’s an immediacy to it. I   went on my Twitter this morning. The latest episode dropped last   night at midnight and by 7:30 a. m. this morning there’s already a   long stream of people commenting on it on Twitter. That’s very   different from a book, which takes a long time to kind of gain   traction. ” ”   Also, there’s more freedom in the medium, more freedom to use   emotion, to be outraged. A lot of these episodes are angry  —   or   even funny  —   in a way that my books are rarely. My podcast   unleashes my id. ” ’Feloni: There are recurring topics that you keep   coming back to in your career and that you have really strong   feelings about. How do you pick your battles? ’ ’Gladwell: When it comes to battle picking, you   ask yourself two questions: What is something that not enough   people are talking about, and what is something that I believe I   have something unique to say about? ’ ’  ’ ”   So the battles I’ve chosen are not the most important ones facing   humanity. There are lots of issues more important than where   billionaires donate their money, to use the example I discuss in   the latest episode of the podcast. But I do think it’s something   we don’t talk about enough, and I think that after 15 years of   writing books and 20 years at The New Yorker, I now have a kind   of platform that allows me to be heard when I sound off on these   subjects. And I think it would be a crime not to use that   platform. ” ”   And I think as a Canadian I do have something unique to say about   America’s educational system, which to an outsider is completely   absurd. I mean, it’s so nuts, that you kind of have to be from a   different place to sort of speak to its inherent absurdity. ” ’   So I chose to dedicate three episodes of ”Revisionist History” to   what’’s wrong with the American educational system because it fits   my two criteria for battles. ’ ”   I like to go back and forth between my tried and true hobby   horses and new things. I don’t want to be like the angry old guy   in the corner who is always ranting and raving about the same   things  —   but I don’t mind doing that just a little bit! ” ’Feloni: You reach conclusions in your work in a   way that prompts your audience to either do something or see the   world in a different light. Do you find that always shaping these   theses affects how you live your own life? ’ ’Gladwell: Since becoming a journalist, each time   I engage with subjects I become more radicalized. ’ ”   If you met me as a 21 year old, I was actually conservative. And   I would describe my politics back then as quite complacent. I am   now substantially to the left of my    self. But it’s   not so much about political positioning as it is that I’m now   substantially more outspoken than I was back then. ” ”   Writing about these various things has made me a little bit   angrier, and it’s certainly fueled my passion about things. ” ’Feloni: Can you give me an instance where a   certain topic has made you angrier? ’ ’Gladwell:  and I am a serious football fan. I had watched   football for 25 years without ever entertaining the notion that I   was morally complicit in what the game was doing to people. And   then I wrote that article, which made me think about, ”Well, wait   a minute. What does it mean for me to sit and watch and give my   implicit consent to the economic enterprise that is football when   the game itself is harming a huge number of its participants?”   That’’s a very uncomfortable thought. It’’s not a thought that   sports fans normally have to ask themselves. ’ ”   I continue to watch football but now I’m conflicted about it! I   think I am in the process of divorcing myself from the game. It’s   hard because I’m a serious fan. But every year I watch less and   every year I feel guiltier about the football that I do watch,   and the delight I take in people harming themselves. It’s just   crazy. ” ’   There are a million other sports you can watch that do not   involve the physical destruction of the participants, right? I   actually find myself watching a lot more basketball and a lot   less football. So I am finding more productive outlets for my   sports fanaticism. ’ ”   That’s a small example. But also, I give money to things that I   think are worthy causes, and my definition of a worthy cause has   been profoundly shaped by a lot of my writing. ” ’Feloni: There’’s a section in your book ”” where you mention  since you   first publicly explored them in ””   eight years earlier. What’’s an idea commonly associated with you   that your readers may be surprised to hear you no longer believe   in? ’ ’Gladwell: In ”Tipping Point,” there’’s a chapter   trying to explain the fall of crime in New York City. I talk   quite positively about the broken windows theory [which states   that cracking down on small crimes prevents larger crimes]. And   that was written at a time, the late 1990s, where that idea was   very much en vogue. I think that it had a place in New York’’s   transformation, but I do think that in New York, and other places   as well, that idea was taken too far. It led to a kind of   punitive policing, which I think has clearly become a big   problem. ’ ’  ’ ’   By ”David and Goliath,” published three years ago, I was talking   about the opposite, about a woman in the NYPD who has had   extraordinary results in reducing juvenile crime rates in   Brownsville, Brooklyn by reaching out to the community, building   relationships with the families of young offenders, and winning   them over. ’ ’   That’’s a case where my views have evolved substantially, and I   hope that people don’’t take that chapter in ”The Tipping Point”   too seriously, because I just don’’t think it’’s relevant to 2016. ’ ’Feloni: I would assume that these ideas about   the relationship between authority and the people it is intended   to protect has been front of mind when we have a week of violence   in  and . ’ ’Gladwell: A theme of ”David and Goliath” is this   idea of legitimacy, that civil societies work when the citizenry   perceives their governing institutions to be legitimate, and that   is based on three principles: fairness  —   that everyone is treated   the same; transparency  —   that you know exactly what the   consequences of certain actions are; and responsiveness  —   when   you feel that you can stand up and complain and that you will be   heard. ’ ”   What the police do doesn’t work unless the population believes in   what the police are doing and believes in the legitimacy of the   institution of the police force. ” ”   So the first task of a police force is not to fight crime and   enforce the law. It is to establish legitimacy with the     citizenry and then fight crime and enforce   the law. I think that’s the issue. ” ”   When we look at  and those that follow, the sad fact is   that in many places in this country, the police have lost their   legitimacy. They’re no longer perceived to be transparent,   predictable, open, and listening to the population, particularly   in the   community. ” ”   At the same time, I think it’s important to understand that we   are talking about a small percentage of the police in this   country and the populations in this country. By and large I think   the policing of this country is done in a really good way. I   think that we have a lot to be proud of, but I think we’ve gone   awry a bit in the last couple of years. ” ”   The militarization of police, and the particular defensiveness of   the police has led to these really troubling incidents and I   don’t think it’s a trivial issue. I think that restoring the   legitimacy of law enforcement has got to be one of the single   most important tasks facing the country. ” ”Feloni: From what you’ve seen and researchers   you’ve spoken with, what are some things you think could be done   to restore legitimacy? ” ”Gladwell: One of the things I think the police   have to do is to stop behaving like armies. There’s a really   brilliant writer named  who’s been writing a lot about this. ” ” WATCH: Gladwell’s advice for police ” ”   I saw that one photo recently of  in full on, not just riot gear, but equipment   that made them look like they were in Fallujah! You can’t have   that  —   you can’t have cops with automatic weapons and armored   cars looking like they are about to take out ISIS in the middle   of an American town. I mean, that’s just crazy. I suppose you   could make a case that they are under siege, but none of that is   worth it. They are driving a wedge between themselves and the   American population. ” ”   Every cop will tell you that their real job is being a social   worker. That’s what they do all day. The large majority of police   officers in this country never even draw their gun, let alone   fire it. They do conflict resolution, right? And if that’s their   job, why do they need to look like they’re an occupying force? ” ’   The one thing that came out of Dallas was that the police chief   reminded us what the real role of the police is  —   talk about a   guy who with grace and dignity and wisdom took an incredibly   volatile situation and showed what intelligent law enforcement   ought to be doing, which is restoring peace and harmony to the   communities that they are obliged to serve. There are plenty of   police officers out there who do the job right and I think our   job is just to elevate those people as role models. ’ ”Feloni: With the Republican National Convention   this week we’ve officially seen Donald Trump rise from someone   who many wrote off to now the GOP candidate. ” ”Gladwell: Trump is an innovator who has shown   how out of step the political establishment was. Which I think,   probably, in the long term will be healthy. We have to figure out   how to reinvigorate our political institutions and he’s   demonstrating to us the urgency of that task. ” ”   My biggest reaction to the convention is that I’m always   surprised when people don’t take the long view. So you have an   extraordinarily successful democracy that’s been around for going   on 250 years, and it’s been successful because of the strength of   its institutions, and because people have respected those   institutions. ” ”   The kind of rhetoric that people are using now strikes me as   incredibly damaging. You may hate Hillary Clinton and you may   have good reason for hating Hillary Clinton, but Hillary Clinton   is one person who even if she’s elected will be gone one day and   you still have the task of keeping American democracy going. ” ”   You know, do I think a Trump presidency would be bad news? Yeah,   I do, I’ll be honest. Do I think that American democracy ends if   Trump is president? No! I think, there are plenty of checks and   balances in place. I think he would do some damage to the country   but we would recover. The office of the presidency and American   democratic institutions are a lot stronger than one person. So if   he wins, our job is just to keep the office strong, right? And   hope he’ll be replaced by something better! ” ’ WATCH: Gladwell on the value of           simplicity ’ ’Feloni: From ”The Tipping Point” forward, the   most common critique of your work is that you take a very complex   topic, oversimplify it, and then draw conclusions that may be   incorrect or harmful. What’’s your response to these critics? ’ ”Gladwell: Well, I would say first of all, anyone   who wants to challenge the status quo always gets that response.   Ninety percent of the time, that’s just bull. That’s just the way   in which people choose to prop up their own privilege or their   own particular position. So mostly I shrug it off. ” ”   And then other times I’ll say why is simplifying things such a   negative accusation? That’s my job. That’s called journalism!   There is nothing more common than critics of journalists accusing   them of practicing journalism. It is our function in the world to   take things that are complicated and render them in a form that     can follow and make sense of. ” ’   Do I occasionally oversimplify? Of course I do! That is my job as   well. Sometimes you have to oversimplify. ’ ”   If the choice is between keeping an issue in the dark because   most of us can never access it, or reducing some of the nuance   past the point where experts feel comfortable, I will always   choose the latter. If you can introduce a topic to someone in a   form that is digestible, then they can start adding back the   nuance. We can have a conversation and we can start talking about   the complexity, but you’ve got to start the conversation. My job,   the way I see it, is to start the conversation. ” ’ and I used as my metaphor for how amenities have   gotten out of control at American colleges the fact that the food   at Bowdoin is over the top [and that means less money for   scholarships]. Is that the whole story about amenities? No. I’’m   very plain in the episode it’’s not the whole thing, but I’’m using   that as my way in. I want people to say, ”Wait a minute, what   does that say about American colleges that you can get food at   liberal arts colleges that is as good as what you would get at   the Four Seasons?” Once you get it, once you grasp that point,   then we can start to have a much more sophisticated argument. ’ ”   There are some people, who I’ll charitably call snobs, who are   dismissive of any conversation that doesn’t begin with the full   level of complexity. That’s just not how the world works. ” ’Feloni: In the sixth episode of ”Revisionist   History,” you revisit the argument that millionaires and   billionaires who donate money to rich universities are wasting   their money, which could do more good at much less wealthy   institutions. It’’s an argument that you publicly started on   Twitter last year when you criticized hedge fund manager John   Paulson for his $400 million donation to Harvard.  Did you see   that? ’ ” WATCH: Gladwell says don’t give money to           Princeton ” ’Gladwell: Yes! That was hilarious. Round up all   these incredibly, really smart and sophisticated investors who   have made billions of dollars and get them talking about a   relatively complex social issue and they sound like idiots! ’ ”   They give money to Harvard or Stanford because all their friends   pat them on the back, they get their name on a prestigious   building, and they get associated with all of the incredible   brand value of those institutions, but they haven’t thought,   clearly, about the social justice implications of what they’re   doing. And they get uncomfortable when someone says, well wait a   minute, you have not thought as seriously about your philanthropy   as you have about your investment decisions and maybe you ought   to take it as seriously. ” ”   You know, . If he devoted even a fraction   of the time, energy, and thought to this philanthropy as he did   to that, the world would be such a better place. All I’m saying   is you guys have IQs of 160, you have billions of dollars in the   bank, and you are accustomed to deep and thoughtful analysis  —     for God’s sake, think about your philanthropy, don’t just write a   check to the fanciest institution you can find! ” ’  ’ ’   I thought it was profoundly telling that instead of responding to   that criticism by saying, ”Actually, you know what, maybe I   should think twice about where I give my $100 million,” they got   all defensive. ’ ”Feloni: What’s your advice to high school   students considering college, or recent college graduates   embarking on their career? ” ’Gladwell: This is connected to the point I make   in the episode of ”Revisionist History” where I compare how   Bowdoin and Vassar spend their money. ’
