Pollster and analyst Pat Caddell discussed recent presidential election polling on Friday with Breitbart News Daily SiriusXM host Alex Marlow, saying, “Something is going on in this country in these polls. ”[“All of the tracking polls keep holding at Trump being ahead,” he continued. “And then all of these other polls that are   polls, or whatever   …     I don’t know how they’re doing some of these university polls. You just put the name of some university and apparently it becomes credible, whether they know what they’re doing, or not.  Caddell was pointing out the discrepancy between the different types of polls. “But in any event, polling is all over the place  …    . Something isn’t adding up,” said Caddell. “Something is going  to happen here, I just sense it,” he concluded. Either “Hillary will glide into the White House, or we’re headed for one of the greatest shocks in American politics. I think it’s a very close call. I think the shock potential is enormous. ” Breitbart News Daily airs on SiriusXM Patriot 125 weekdays from 6:00 a. m. to 9:00 a. m. Eastern. LISTEN:
