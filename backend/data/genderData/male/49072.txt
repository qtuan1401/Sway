’  ’ ’   Hillary Clinton implored the FBI on Friday evening to release   information on its    ”pertinent” to the probe into her use of a private email server. ’ ’   “The American people deserve to get the full and complete facts   immediately,” Clinton told reporters before taking questions. ’ ’   Earlier in the day, FBI Director James Comey sent a vague letter   to congressional leaders notifying them that the bureau was again   actively investigating Clinton’s use of a private server after   discovering new documents “pertinent to the investigation. ” ’ ’ ’ ’Hillary Clinton: ”The American people deserve to get the full and complete facts immediately” ’ ’   Clinton said she learned of the news from media reports and had   not “been contacted by anyone” from the FBI.  ’ ’   The Democratic nominee added that she was ”confident” the   new emails would not change the results of the FBI’’s initial   conclusion. The bureau declined to recommend charges against   her in July, and Attorney General Loretta Lynch said the case was   closed. ’ ’   The new emails were said to have surfaced during a federal   investigation into former New York Rep. Anthony Weiner, the   estranged husband of top aide Huma Abedin. ’ ’   Clinton said she was not sure whether such reports were true. ’ ’   “We’ve heard these rumors,” she said. “We don’t know what to   believe. ” ’ ’   After the conclusion of the news conference, a reporter asked   Clinton if she was “worried” the news could “sink” her campaign. ’ ’   The former secretary of state responded with laughter,  at the scene. ’ ”   The FBI’s announcement on Friday threw a wrench into an   already turbulent presidential campaign with just 11 days before   Election Day, coming as Clinton held leads over her Republican   opponent, Donald Trump, in national polls and surveys in key   battleground states. ” ’ Natasha Bertrand contributed to this report.  ’
