(Want to get this briefing by email? Here’s the  .) Good evening. Here’s the latest. 1. The Justice Department urged a federal appeals court to reinstate President Trump’s travel ban, arguing that a judicial block endangered national security and violated the separation of powers. Whatever the coming ruling, it will almost certainly be appealed to the Supreme Court. The legal and political backlash from the rollout of the order and other missteps have Mr. Trump and his top staff rethinking their improvisational approach to governing. We got an inside look at the confusion within the White House, where aides sometimes confer in the dark because they can’t figure out the light switches. Above, a protest after the ban was announced. _____ 2. With the ban blocked, dozens of Syrian and Iraqi refugees boarded a plane in Amman, Jordan, and headed to the U. S. full of hope but also some trepidation. “Goodbyes are difficult,” said one man. “But we are going where there will be a future for us. ” _____ 3. With the Senate already hinting it could work through the weekend, expect another busy week at the Capitol. Vice President Mike Pence could be called upon break a   tie in the Senate over the nomination of Betsy DeVos as education secretary. Mr. Trump’s nominee for attorney general, Senator Jeff Sessions of Alabama, could be confirmed this week, along with Scott Pruitt as head of the Environmental Protection Agency. Today’s episode of our new podcast, The Daily, focuses on Mr. Trump’s changes to   financial rules.

His first target was net neutrality. He released about a dozen actions in the past week, many buried on the agency’s website and not publicly announced, stunning consumer advocacy groups and telecom analysts. _____ 5. Israel’s Parliament passed a provocative law that would retroactively legalize Jewish settlements on privately owned Palestinian land. It was an assertive move by the right wing  —   but the law will likely be struck down by the country’s high court. Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu was on his way back from a meeting with Britain’s leaders as the law was being debated. _____ 6. Queen Elizabeth II’s sapphire jubilee, marking 65 years on the British throne, brought new coins, a stamp and gun salutes. The only thing missing? The queen, 90, who spent a private and reflective day out of the public eye. _____ 7. A    Syrian refugee in Germany whose selfie with Angela Merkel ended up on fake news websites is suing Facebook. The fake news articles linked him to terrorism, and he’s seeking to prevent Facebook from allowing users to repost the image. “Many people hate me, but all I did was take a selfie,” he said. _____ 8. Some remarkably good public health news: Researchers may have found the tools to stop cholera, the global pandemic that rose from the swamps of Bangladesh two centuries ago. Not only are there extremely effective treatments, but a vaccine accepted by the W. H. O. is being stockpiled for epidemics. And soon, there may be enough to begin routine vaccination in countries where the disease has a permanent foothold. _____ 9. The story of Ona Judge, a slave held by Martha Washington, the wife of George Washington, reveals a great deal about the harsh reality of slavery under a founding father often praised for having freed his slaves upon his death. Hearing that she was to be given away, Ms. Judge escaped from the presidential residence in Philadelphia in 1796, embarrassing the Washingtons. She got to New Hampshire, where she evaded George Washington’s dogged, sometimes illegal efforts to recapture her. “It’s saying, ‘Whatever I might think about slavery in the abstract, I should be able to do what I want with my property,’ ” one historian observed. Above, Erica Armstrong Dunbar, the author of a new book about Ms. Judge. _____ 10. What a game, huh? The New England Patriots made a comeback for the ages (and the record books) in the fourth quarter of the 51st Super Bowl. No team had ever come back from such a gaping deficit in the big game. But there has never been anyone like Tom Brady, either. Our columnist calls him “unbelievable and unforgettable,” even if as many people seem to despise him as love him. And while he set the stage for a ratings bonanza, early numbers indicate the game was less watched than last year’s. _____ 11. Americans may be divided, but some things still bring them together. Like meatloaf. Two Times writers, the   columnist Frank Bruni and the Congressional correspondent Jennifer Steinhauer, were able to bypass all kinds of societal fractures as they collected material from celebrity chefs and politicians for a book of 50 meatloaf recipes (including a vegetarian one) and related ruminations. Paul Ryan “was much more interested in talking to me about meatloaf than he was the earned tax credit,” Ms. Steinhauer said. _____ Photographs may appear out of order for some readers.
