’  ’ ’   On February 8, 1984, a few of the most prominent businessmen in   New York  —   members of the New York State Urban Development   Corporation  —   were holding a news conference. ’ ”   Among them was a press darling  —   a man whose brash   reputation and penchant for public tirades had made him one of   the city’s most recognizable figures. ” ’   His rise to prominence a decade earlier sprung from his purchase   of a major New York institution. He was tall, an imposing figure   with his hair just long enough to be swept flat behind his   ears. He often bellowed, ”You’’re fired! ,” a connotation   embraced by households across the country. ’ ’   Standing nearby at that news conference was Donald Trump. ’ ’   The man he was watching was George Steinbrenner, the owner   of the New York Yankees. Known simply as ”The Boss,” Steinbrenner   is the man Trump has . ’ ”   Trump doesn’t toss around such a label frequently, at least in   the press. But in Steinbrenner, the famed, bombastic owner,   Trump saw a role model. ” ”   Steinbrenner’s flair was something Trump came to emulate  —   and,   in many, ways surpass. It was evident in his business career, on   television, his political rise, and eventually, in the beginnings   of his   presidency. ” ’   Ray Negron, a Yankees employee for more than 40 years who serves   as a columnist for Newsmax, told Business Insider that   Steinbrenner was a ”very strong mentor” to Trump. ’ ’   ”Especially going back into the 70s, when George won the   championships and Trump was buying the football team,” Negron   said, referring to Trump’’s purchase of the USFL’’s New York   Generals. ”He spent a lot of time in talking to George about the   appropriate ways and et cetera and he took everything to   heart.” ’ ’   ”And he looked at Steinbrenner as a big brother, as a hero, and   you know he don’’t look at anybody that way,” Negron continued.   ”They were both the same.” ’ ”   As the Yankees prepare to open their 2017 season Sunday and Trump   navigates through the early throes of his presidency, signs of   Steinbrenner’s influence on Trump  —   and his family  —   linger. On   Thursday,  on Instagram   of himself with his father and Steinbrenner. ” ’   ”I certainly didn’’t get the magnitude of this NY moment at the   time but I definitely do now. Really amazing history there,” he   wrote. ’ ’   The White House did not respond to requests for comment for this   story. ’ ’  ’ ”   For Negron, the comparisons began with both men’s fathers. ” ”   Trump’s father, Fred, wasn’t too keen on the young developer’s   decision to enter the Manhattan market, instead insisting that   the younger Trump should continue with the family’s outerborough   real estate business, in which it had found its initial success. ” ”   Steinbrenner’s father, Henry, wasn’t terribly enthused with his   son’s decision to buy the Cleveland Pipers, a professional   basketball team. The younger Steinbrenner’s venture was nothing   short of an abject failure, but his next venture in sports   ownership proved infinitely more successful. ” ”   Like Trump, Steinbrenner had gotten his start in the family’s   successful business. In his case, it was the family’s shipping   company. ” ’   ”All these different variables, they had a lot of things in   common,” Negron said. ”Throughout the years he always called Mr.   Steinbrenner . .. in any type of scenario. He would always   checked in on him, and ’’The Boss’’ always gave him what he thought   was the right advice.” ’ ’   Negron said it was quite common to hear Steinbrenner’’s secretary   alerting the owner ”Mr. Steinbrenner, Trump on [line] two.” ’ ’   He made note that Trump borrowed his trademark phrase for his NBC   show, ”The Apprentice,” from Steinbrenner, who first popularized   ”” in his  with manager   Billy Martin, whom Steinbrenner hired and fired a total of five   times. ’ ’   Trump ”borrowed that from the great George Steinbrenner, and   people forget that,” Negron said. ” ’ ’   A controversial figure in his own right, Steinbrenner found   himself in trouble at various points of his career. There were   the illegal campaign contributions to President Richard Nixon.   Years later, he paid to have dirt dug up on a star Yankees   player, Dave Winfield. At both points, he served suspensions from   Major League Baseball. In the first, he pleaded guilty to   criminal charges for which he was later pardoned by   President Ronald Reagan. ’ ’   And Steinbrenner, as evidenced by his tumultuous relationship   with Martin, was known to be an extremely tough person to work   for. ’ ’  ’ ’  ’ ’   As New York Times columnist Maureen Dowd wrote just days before   the November election, Steinbrenner was one of the ”towering   characters” Trump began to hang around as his profile began to   grow. She wrote that ”from Steinbrenner, he learned about   indiscriminately grabbing the limelight”: ’ ’   Michael O’’Keeffe, a former New York Daily News columnist who now   works at Newsday, seconded Dowd’’s sentiment. He told   Business Insider that from Steinbrenner and the ”Le Club” crowd,   Trump learned how to be ”larger than life.” Both Steinbrenner and   Trump also sometimes said inflammatory things off the top of   their heads without fully considering the ramifications, he   added. ’ ’   But to O’’Keeffe, there was a ”big difference” between the two   bombastic men. ’ ’  ’ ’  ’ ’  ’ ’  ’ ’   ”I got a lot of feedback from that column,” he said. ”I got a ton   of emails, some really ugly: People just saying ’’you’’re a          idiot, you’’re a        moron. George would be   for Trump! ’’” ’ ’   O’’Keeffe said a Yankees employee even doubted him, telling the   Daily News columnist ”’’you’’re just wrong about that. He liked   Trump, he hung around with Trump. ’’” ’ ’  ’ ”   Whether or not he would’ve voted for his old pal, Negron is   confident that, even though Trump is president,   the   relationship between the two would still   be evident. ” ’  ’ ’   After Steinbrenner’’s death, Trump wrote how his ”great friend”   was a ”true legend” who ”understood winning better than anybody.” ’ ’   ”There will never be anyone like him in New York,”  ”The country has   lost a truly great man.” ’ ”   The level of admiration seeped  at the time of the famed baseball   owner’s death: ” ’   In the years that followed, Trump posted a number of tweets in   which he mentioned Steinbrenner, many of which also dealt   with a longstanding annoyance he had with   third   baseman Alex Rodriguez. ’ ’  ’ ’   Trump wrote that Steinbrenner ”would have done a major number” on   the Yankees star and ”would have gotten out of” his contract long   ago. He also wrote that the team was ”sure lucky” Steinbrenner   was no longer around  —   the team is currently run by his two sons,   Hal and Hank  —   because ”a lot of people would be losing their   jobs.” After a postseason departure, Trump wrote again that the   team was ”lucky” they didn’’t ”have to deal with George   Steinbrenner.” ’ ’   ”The Yankees really have to be embarrassed losing all four games   to the Mets  —   my great friend George Steinbrenner would be going   nuts!” he wrote after the Yankees’’ crosstown rivals swept them in   2013. ’ ’   While Trump heaped praise through the decades on Steinbrenner for   being a ”winner,” perhaps the most important skill he   learned was the ability to ”work the political system,”   something he boasted of for months along the campaign trail. ’ ’  ’ ’  ’ ’   Stone said Steinbrenner was ”a patriot” and ”a man’’s man in   a John Wayne type sense.” ’ ’  ’ ’  ’ ’  ’ ’  ’ ’  ’ ’On February 8, 1984, a few of the most. ..’ ’’ ’’ ’’
