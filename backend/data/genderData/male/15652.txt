Wednesday at Stanford University, Democratic presidential candidate Hillary Clinton criticized Republican presidential candidates Donald Trump and Sen. Ted Cruz ( ) for their proposals for fighting the Islamic State (ISIS) in light of yesterdays Brussels terror attack.  On Cruz’s calls to carpet bombing, Clinton said, “It would also be a serious mistake to carpet bomb populated areas into oblivion. Proposing that doesn’t make you sound tough. It makes you sound like you’re in over your head. Slogans aren’t a strategy. Loose cannons tend to misfire. ” On Donald Trump’s NATO questions, Clinton said, “Turning our back on our alliances or turning our alliance into a protection racket would reverse decades of bipartisan American leadership and send a dangerous signal to friend and foe alike. Putin already hopes to divide Europe. If Mr. Trump gets his way, it will be like Christmas in the Kremlin. It will make America less safe and the world more dangerous. ” On Cruz’s calls to increase surveillance activity in Muslim areas, Clinton said, “When Republican candidates like Ted Cruz call for treating American Muslims like criminals and for racially profiling predominantly Muslim neighborhoods, it’s wrong, it’s counterproductive, and it’s dangerous. ” She added, “In our fight against radical jihadism, we have to do what actually works. One thing we know that does not work is offensive, inflammatory rhetoric that demonizes all Muslims. ” Follow Pam Key on Twitter @pamkeyNEN
