Pollster and political analyst Pat Caddell explained to Breitbart News Daily SiriusXM host Alex Marlow what he believes Republican presidential candidate Donald Trump needs to do down the stretch of the 2016 election. [Caddell said, “The thing he needs to do better is raise the stakes in the election into a referendum. ”  He stated that the choice for voters is “whether or not they’re going to take back control of their country,” adding, “That’s what this revolt has been all year in both parties   …     the Sanders effort, the Trump emergence. ” Caddell said, “And go to those questions of past and future: do you want to keep going the course we have, or do you think we need change?” “People are not happy where the country is going,” asserted Caddell, continuing: They are unhappy with the economy. They are not happy with American foreign policy. And when you get down through the specifics to the broader issues  —   Iran, foreign policy, all of these things  —   more important than anything is the issue of who owns the country. The political class is in charge. And when you raise it to that level   …     this is a campaign for the country. Caddell also pointed out that Trump is the “independent variable” in the campaign as to whether he wins or loses, and he needs to broaden the election theme to one in which the people want to take back control of the country from the political class.
