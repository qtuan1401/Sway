Three new polls from Gravis Marketing show Donald Trump close behind Hillary Clinton in Iowa and Colorado, but still lagging in Michigan. [But the polls are only of individuals, not of registered voters. That focus on individuals, not likely voters, downplays Trump’s likely   support because the GOP typically has higher support among registered voters than among all individuals. Also, all three polls show Trump is closer to the Democrat than Gov. Mitt Romney managed to achieve in the 2012 election.  In Colorado, the poll of 1, 313 people shows Clinton 2 points ahead, with 43 percent to 41 percent for Trump. That leaves 16 percent of individuals yet to pick either of the candidates. In 2012, President Obama won the state by 4. 7 points. In Iowa, the Gravis poll of 1, 316 people shows Clinton 2 points ahead, at 42 percent with Trump at 40 percent. That puts Trump in a relatively good position, partly because the state picked Obama by 5. 6 percent in 2012. In Michigan, the poll of 1, 562 individuals shows Clinton with a 7 point lead, at 48 percent to 41 percent. That puts her close to the 50 percent position among all persons  —   but not likely voters. But Obama won the state with a 9. 5 percent lead in 2012.
