Washington (CNN) Ret. Maj. Gen James ”Spider” Marks said Thursday that Hillary Clinton will do a better job defending the country and the Constitution than Donald Trump. ”What I care about is national security first and foremost,” Marks, a CNN military analyst, told CNN’s Erin Burnett on ”Erin Burnett OutFront.” ”This is first and foremost. It’s the job of the president of the United States, of our commander in chief, to defend the Constitution. I want that done right. I think that Hillary Clinton will do that better than Donald Trump.” He said that he is planning to vote for Clinton for president in November. ”I made that decision,” he said. ”I have been wrong so many times . .. You don’t see that level of humility in this candidate (Trump). That’s what bugs me. I’m not a big fan of where we are right now with this current administration.” Earlier on the show, Marks denounced Trump’s claim that President Barack Obama founded ISIS, calling it ”crazy talk.” Donald Trump: I meant that Obama founded ISIS, literally, ”That’s crazy talk,” Marks said. ”This President is not the founder of ISIS. Clearly, there’s culpability. There’s a lot we could have done in Iraq. Our departure in 2011 was premature. Conditions were not set . .. This is an organized military with a focus.” Trump said Thursday that he meant exactly what he said when he said Obama was the ”founder of ISIS” and objected to conservative radio show host Hugh Hewitt when he tried to clarify the GOP nominee’s position. ”No, I meant he’s the founder of ISIS,” Trump said. ”I do. He was the most valuable player. I give him the most valuable player award. I give her, too, by the way, Hillary Clinton.”
