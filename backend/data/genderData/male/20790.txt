Thanks to Breitbart News’ #DumpKelloggs petition, over 380, 000 Americans, many of whom voted for   Donald Trump, have vowed to boycott Kellogg’s after the cereal company’s decision to pull its advertising. [After   advocacy groups launched a social media campaign to coerce companies away from advertising on Breitbart, Kellogg’s publicly announced they would comply with their demands  —   and made the vague claim that Breitbart and its tens of millions of readers “aren’t aligned with” the cereal maker’s “values as a company. ”   Indeed, our research has shown Kellogg’s values would not “align” with most Americans. Their namesake nonprofit organization W. K. Kellogg Foundation has deep financial ties to   billionaire George Soros and has donated nearly a million dollars to   group Black Lives Matter. Understandably, more than 370, 000 individuals have vowed that when they buy groceries, they won’t hand their   dollars over to a company at ease with placating radical   agitators just because they’re making a little noise. Kellogg’s manufactures myriad products under several brand names, from Pringles to Eggo waffles, as well as Special K and Frosted Flakes cereals and many more.  As more Americans joined the #DumpKelloggs campaign, it’s worth listing all the Kelloggs brands you won’t find in Trump voters’ shopping carts. Sign the #DumpKelloggs boycott petition here.
