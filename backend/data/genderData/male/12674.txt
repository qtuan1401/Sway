As the New England Patriots took yet another Super Bowl win, liberals from coast to coast exploded with vitriol on social media, furious that a team with tangential links to President Donald Trump came out on top Sunday. Since that final touchdown the hash tag #NotMySuperBowlChamps and other similar tags have been trending. [The   sports media has been out for blood for the better part of a year because Patriots quarterback Tom Brady, coach Bill Belichick, and team owner Robert Kraft all came out as unapologetic fans of President Trump. And, now that they’ve won the Super Bowl the left has turned apoplectic.  Since last night’s big game, liberals have flooded Twitter, Facebook, and other social media services with several versions of the hash tag after Trump pal Tom Brady led his team to yet another Super Bowl title. Along with #NotMySuperBowlChamps, users also employed #NotMySuperBowlChampions and #NotMySuperBowlTeam to attack the Patriots. The winner should be determined by who has more fans, not more points. Winning is racist and Tom Brady is a fascist. #NotMySuperBowlChamps pic. twitter.   —   Elizabeth® (@MissLizzyNJ) February 6, 2017,  *weeps* I can’t believe this can happen in our country ya’ll *snot bubble* @MileyCyrus #NotMySuperBowlChamps pic. twitter.   —   Jendetta© reeeeee! ❄️ (@PolitiKellyRite) February 6, 2017,  I’m protesting #notmysuperbowlchampion,  —   Chance Bishop (@THEchancebishop) February 6, 2017,  The Patriots didn’t win today.
