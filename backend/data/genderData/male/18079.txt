At a media availability on Bangladesh on Monday, Secretary of State John Kerry discussed the threat of terrorism at home and abroad.  Part of his proposal to fight this threat had to do with the media and how it covers terrorism. According to Fox News and a transcript of the press conference provided by the State Department, Kerry said the media could “do us a service” by not covering terrorism “quite as much. “Remember this: No country is immune from terrorism,” he said. “It’s easy to terrorize. Government and law enforcement have to be correct 24 hours a day, 7 days a week, 365 days a year. But if you decide one day you’re going to be a terrorist and you’re willing to kill yourself, you can go out and kill some people. You can make some noise. Perhaps the media would do us all a service if they didn’t cover it quite as much. People wouldn’t know what’s going on. The fact is we have to stand together, and the United States is standing with Bangladesh in this fight. ” Follow Jeff Poor on Twitter @jeff_poor
