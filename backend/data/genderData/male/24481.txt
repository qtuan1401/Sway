Dana Milbank and the Washington Post streamed a video of Milbank literally eating his words  —   a column that predicted Donald Trump would not be the Republican nominee for President. [Milbank made good on his promise from an October column, titled “Trump will lose, or I will eat this column,” by eating a   meal prepared with the printed version of the piece.  In the video, Milbank sips Trump wine and eats a shredded newspaper taco bowl containing his horrendously wrong analysis on Trump’s chances.  Milbank’s column is based around a sanctimonious comment Mitt Romney made at the time dismissing the business mogul’s presidential chances. In the column, Milbank quotes Romney saying “The American people are a very good people and by and large find people of similar character to elect to the highest office in the land. ” To be clear, Romney was talking about how he expected people to react to Donald Trump  —   not their rejection of his presidential aspirations in 2008 and 2012. Milbank’s riff off the Romney comment led to the promise to eat his words: “In fact, I’m so certain Trump won’t win the nomination that I’ll eat my words if he does. Literally: The day Trump clinches the nomination I will eat the page on which this column is printed in Sunday’s Post. I have this confidence for the same reason Romney does: Americans are better than Trump. ” If eating some well cooked newspaper is the only consequence of providing professional analysis that is 180 degrees from what actually happens, Milbank should consider himself blessed.
