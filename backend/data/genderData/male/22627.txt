  screenwriter Aaron Sorkin unloaded on Donald Trump in a letter Wednesday, calling his historic election a win for every racist and misogynist in America. [“Well, the world changed last night in a way I couldn’t protect us from,” the West Wing creator wrote in an open letter to his daughter and her mother, Julia, published by Vanity Fair. “I won’t sugarcoat it  —   this is truly horrible. ”  The famed screenwriter called   Trump a “thoroughly incompetent pig” who has “dangerous ideas. ” “It’s hardly the first time my candidate didn’t win (in fact it’s the sixth time) but it is the first time a thoroughly incompetent pig with dangerous ideas, a serious psychiatric disorder, no knowledge of the world and no curiosity to learn has,” Sorkin wrote. “The [Ku Klux] Klan won last night,” he wrote in the letter published Wednesday. “White nationalists. Sexists, racists and buffoons. Angry young white men who think rap music and Cinco de Mayo are a threat to their way of life (or are the reason for their way of life) have been given cause to celebrate. ” Sorkin said he refuses to allow his daughter to live in a “country shaped by hateful and stupid men. ” “Grandpa fought in World War II and when he came home this country handed him an opportunity to make a great life for his family,” he wrote. “I will not hand his granddaughter a country shaped by hateful and stupid men. ” In June, the Newsroom creator slammed Trump’s candidacy, calling it a “terribly dangerous situation. ” Now that Trump has won, Sorkin says: “The battle isn’t over, it’s just begun. ”   Follow Jerome Hudson on Twitter: @jeromeehudson
