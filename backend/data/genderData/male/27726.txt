New York   for the Trump campaign and New York City Councilman from Staten Island Joe Borelli spoke to Breitbart News Daily SiriusXM host Stephen K. Bannon about the two national political conventions. [“There was really a measured program, or rather, an effort, to try to silence some of the protesters that they knew would happen [at the Democrat convention],” Borelli said. “The prediction of convention apocalypse that the mainstream media predicted for the RNC was actually materialized at the DNC. ”  He added: You had protesters dominating some coverage outside, knocking things down. The chairman of the party resigned in scandal. You had the nominees themselves, their speeches, both Tim Kaine and Hillary Clinton, fell completely flat.   …     For a week leading up to the RNC, we were talking about just how big of a disaster the RNC was going to be, and what happened? You’ve actually seen it materialize now with the DNC. I’m sure we’re not going to see the media bring back the narrative of how the DNC failed. As for the Bernie Sanders supporters present, Borelli said, “What you didn’t see last night was an en mass Sanders’ camp moved behind Hillary Clinton. ” Pointing out that Democrats often call Republicans fascists, he concluded, “But then you see them not only rigging the election, but then trying to drown out dissent at their own convention. It’s absurd. It’s troubling. It’s troubling to anyone who likes democracy. ” Breitbart News Daily airs on SiriusXM Patriot 125 weekdays from 6:00 a. m. to 9:00 a. m. Eastern.
