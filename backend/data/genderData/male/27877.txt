A new Field poll released Tuesday shows that while Democratic presidential nominee Hillary Clinton still enjoys a sizable lead among likely voters in California, her lead is slipping significantly, falling seven points since July. [“While Clinton continues to hold a sizable   statewide advantage (50% to 33%) over Trump in this year’s presidential election, that margin is down from   points in July, prior to the Democratic and Republican national conventions,” the poll reports.  The key, the poll reports, is a drop in Clinton’s favorability. “More Californians now view her unfavorably (53%) than favorably (47%) a reversal from July. In addition, a very large proportion of the state’s electorate (41%) now reports having a ‘very unfavorable’ opinion of Clinton,” the Field poll reports. It notes that while Trump’s favorability has increased somewhat from July, the Republican presidential nominee is still seen unfavorably by nearly    likely voters in California. The poll also notes that Trump is narrowly winning California’s interior regions, while Clinton leads coastal counties by a nearly    margin. Trump also leads among voters over 65, among evangelicals, and among voters with “no more than a high school education. ” Clinton leads among voters under 40,   and college graduates. In addition, “Clinton holds a    advantage among the state’s Latino voters, is favored    among African Americans and has a greater than    lead among Asian Americans,” though her lead is only six points among   white voters. The Field poll also showed 58% of California’s registered voters approve of President Barack Obama, while 42% disapprove. The poll was conducted online among 1, 800 registered voters and 1, 426 likely voters. No margin of error was reported. Joel B. Pollak is Senior    at Breitbart News.
