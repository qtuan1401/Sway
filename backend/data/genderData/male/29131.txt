When asked about his preference for president in 2016, former Boston Red Sox ace Curt Schilling told Breitbart News Daily SiriusXM host Stephen K. Bannon, “Of the four people left, the only person I can honestly see sitting in the White House is Donald Trump as a leader.  The caveat to that is, I need him to start acting like a leader. ”[Schilling was the special guest at a “Breitbart News Patriot Forum” listener event for SiriusXM in New York City on Wednesday, hosted by Bannon and Breitbart Editor in Chief Alex Marlow.  As for his supporting Trump, Schilling elaborated, “Listen, I get it. You’re going to make America great again. I believe it. I’ve known [Trump] for quite a while. ” When asked if he thought Trump was currently the leader or the clown in the clubhouse, Schilling said, “I think he’s both,” adding, “I don’t need you to talk trash about   …     and say, he’s stupid, or they’re stupid and they’re a liar. I get it. And you’re getting advice to do the things that you need to get advice to do, but I don’t want to hear, ‘We’re going to make America great, again.’ I want to hear how you’re going to do it. ” Schilling continued, “I know you can’t give me line item details specifically to a budget for this or I know we’re going to clean government waste. What does that mean? Does that mean you’re going to gut some of the most useless, ridiculous expenses we have? What does it mean for national defense? I believe, having known him, that what he means to say or what he is going to say is, ‘Listen, I’m not going to do this myself. Nobody does this themselves. ’” Schilling said he got to know Trump over a few years and “he’s genuine. ” While taking issue with some of Trump’s comments, Schilling said, “I trust two things: He loves this country, and he will defend this country. ” Breitbart News Daily airs on SiriusXM Patriot 125 weekdays from 6 AM to 9 AM EST.
