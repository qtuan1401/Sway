’  ’ ’   Has Donald Trump ever been more right about anything than when he   ? ’ ’   On January 12, speaking to reporters after the hearing in which   he grilled Secretary of   Rex Tillerson over his   views on human rights, Rubio said: ’ ’   Got that? Remember, Rubio says Senate scrutiny is like a cone and   secretary of state is up at the tip, requiring the most scrutiny   and the least deference. ’ ”   Subsequently, Rubio decided that he could indeed vote to confirm   Tillerson  about   Tillerson’s commitment to advancing human rights and despite   Tillerson being up there at the tip of the scrutiny cone. ” ’’ ”   What was Rubio’s rationale? It was this, according to a statement   on Monday: ” ’   So now Rubio thinks the job of secretary of state is too   important for the Senate to tie up, but that greater scrutiny can   and should be applied to   nominees. ’ ’   I guess the cone got inverted or something. Maybe the Senate has   become a snow cone, with the point at the bottom and Tillerson up   at the delicious,   top. ’ ’   A week and a half ago, on KCRW’’s ”Left, Right & Center,” my   cohost, Rich Lowry of National Review, told me he expected Rubio   would come around and vote for Tillerson despite the brutal   grilling Rubio had given him over Russia and other matters. ’ ”   I asked Rich: If Rubio is going to vote for Tillerson, what was   the point of the   grilling? It would only   reinforce the existing knock on Rubio  —   that he talks a good game   but won’t stand up for his principles if it’s politically costly. ” ”   Rich told me I shouldn’t assume Rubio had thought his strategy   all the way through when he acted. He was right. ” ”   And I wouldn’t hold my breath on Rubio withholding his deference   from future nominees, as he claims he will. ”
