’  ’ ’   The Democratic Party is in the midst of an identity crisis  —   but   a leading Democratic senator said he has an idea of what the left   needs to do in order to win at the ballot box in 2018 and 2020. ’ ’   Sen. Sheldon Whitehouse of Rhode Island, speaking with Business   Insider during a promotional tour for his new   book,  ’ ’  ’ ’   ”I think one of the reasons I wrote this book is that I think   this issue needs to be brought out front and center,” he said.   ”If you have to compete with an entity that is actually a front   group for a big special interest and you haven’’t successfully   told the story of how it’’s just the end of the tentacle, then   you’’re going to be at a huge disadvantage. And what it says will   be given more   credit by the public than if they knew,   ’’Oh, OK, that’’s the glove with the Koch brothers hand in it, with   Wall Street’’s hand in it. ’’ So I think it’’s really important we   focus on that.” ’ ’   Whitehouse added disclosure of donations ”ought to be a really,   really big deal for us.” ’ ’   The second plank, he said, needs to be a ”really, really strong   and simplified economic message,” something he said   Democratic nominee Hillary Clinton did not do in 2016.  ’ ’   ”And we love, love, love to prove our bona fides by having a   really good plan,” he said. ”And nobody wants to hear about a   plan. They want a wall or something simple and captivating. And     plans kind of go in the metal disposal bin.” ’ ’   ”Stuff that people can envision and we can deliver,” he added.   ”I’’ve spent 10 years in the Senate now and the talk about   messaging is making me increasingly insane. I don’’t think you   earn the right to a message until you’’ve earned it by having a   real fight, really being willing to stand up for what you believe   in.” ’ ’   He said Democrats’’ tendency to be ”constantly” moving ”from   message point to message point, positioning yourself on   issues without ever taking a step back, deciding what the hell   you’’re going to do, and jamming it through as best you can, or at   least making it one hell of a big fight so that everyone in the   country knows that it took place,” is a major ”mistake.” ’ ’   The party must take a handful of issues and be exceptionally   visible on them, he said, naming   relief and a   carbon tax as two such things. ’ ’   ”You can pick others, but I think having just a visible known few   that become our, ’’If you elect us, this is what you will get or   we will die trying,’’” he said. ’ ’   The third plank, he said, was making sure the party is ”solid” on   its national security and defense platform. ’ ’   Far too often, he added, Democrats let themselves get painted as   weak on both. ’ ’   ”I think that’’s where, just not letting ourselves get painted   into a    corner,” he said. ”But I think that having   a lot of respect for law enforcement and showing it, having a lot   of respect for the military and showing it  —   and getting ahead of   the big liabilities like cybersecurity are very good places to   be.” ’ ’   ”I don’’t think that’’s going to be a winning hand for us, but it   keeps . .. a winning hand from becoming a winning hand for   the Republicans,” he continued. ’ ’   The GOP has been extremely successful in painting the Democrats   as soft in those areas, he added. ’ ’   ”Look at 2014 when ISIS popped up and Ebola popped up and the   children from Guatemala and Central America were starting to come   across the border,” he said. ”And the next thing you know Fox   News had turned that all into the Ebola babies coming over the   borders to come slice your head off like ISIS into kind of one   big panic. And our Democratic message that election was exactly   zero. And we just got crushed as a result.” ’ ’   ”So that’’s the proof that we can’’t let ourselves get boxed in on   it,” he continued. ”Because frankly, we had just as good policies   if not better in those areas. We just don’’t talk about them.” ’ ”   Each of the three seems to come back to one core idea: that   Democrats don’t have their messaging together, or haven’t been   able to effectively get their message across. ” ’   So why have the Democrats struggled so mightily with this? ’ ’   ”Well, I think if I knew that I would be a bigger wheel in our   operation,” Whitehouse said. ”I don’’t know the answer to that. I   think partly it comes from the sort of        politics that can emerge from a party that has very broad but not   particularly deep backing. So, you’’ve got right with Planned   Parenthood, you’’ve got right with the LGBT community, you’’ve got   right with public labor unions, you’’ve got right with the private   labor unions, you’’ve got right with young voters, and you kind   of, every time you do that, there’’s another added step.” ’ ’   ”And like the guy with 1, 000 nails, nothing penetrates because   there are so many nails you can actually lie on them   comfortably,” he continued. ”So nothing actually sank through.” ’ ’  ’ ’   ”So, I don’’t know, those are some of my original thoughts,” he   continued. ”If we were . .. if it were just a few more centralized   forces who ran our party, then you would say, ’’All right, these   are the sort of three or four things we’’re pushing on. ’’ And   to the folks in other industries who aren’’t part of those   three or four, we’’d just say, ’’Look, shut up for now  —   we’’re   trying to win this election. We’’ll take care of you when we’’re   in. You know we will. So stand by. You don’’t have to clamor. ’’” ’ ’   Democratic voters must take a viewpoint that many on the right   have been able to more easily embrace, particularly in electing   President Donald Trump  —   a focus on winning. ’ ’   ”Everybody, to have their issue at the forefront as your measure   of success  —   your measure of success is we get in, and then we   deliver for you,” he said. ”And, that simply doesn’’t work on our   side the way it does on the other side.” ’ ’   ”For us, it’’s an uphill fight to get a clear, distinctive,   memorable message out of the cacophony of our multiple   support groups,” he continued. ”For the other side, it’’s actually   kind of delivered to them by the organizations behind them that   dominate in the Republican political background . .. and so I   think my colleagues kind of sit on the table reading from the   package. When it comes, they go out and sell it. Whereas we’’re   all like out with everybody making sure it’’s success for us if we   get their idea on the table and the platform has to have 90   different parts to it and if anybody is left out they’’re all   jumping up and down about it.” ’ ’The Democratic Party is in the midst of an. ..’ ’’ ’’ ’’
