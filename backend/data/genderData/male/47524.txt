’  ’ ”   Donald Trump’s choice of running mate has been the source of   endless speculation. ” ”   But even more interesting than whom he picks may be when   he picks. Trump  several times that he won’t reveal his choice until the   Republican National Convention in July. ” ”   Traditionally, candidates have announced their running mates a   week or two before their party’s convention. Some wait just a few   days before the big event, as John McCain did  when he chose Sarah Palin. ” ’   But if Trump keeps his word, it will be the first time in almost   30 years that a candidate has waited until the convention to   reveal the person who will join him on the presidential ticket. ’ ’   Only two candidates in modern history have waited until the   convention to announce their picks: George H. W. Bush, when he   tapped Dan Quayle ; and Ronald Reagan  when he chose Bush. ’ ”   The unconventional move is calculated on Trump’s part, and it   could pay major dividends for his campaign, said Richard Parker,   a Harvard   lecturer and former political consultant. ” ’   Trump ”is a master of free media, and part of what he’’s going to   do with the VP nomination is the   strategy,” Parker   told Business Insider. ”The media will hunger and hunger and   hunger for the name of the VP candidate, and the surge will build   in a crescendo of interest in who he appoints.” ’ ’  ’ ’   ”I think that he’’s following the strategy logically with how he’’s   run the campaign to this day,” he added. ’ ’   Trump said earlier this month that he had  to ”four or five   politicians from within the party’’s establishment,” including   some of his former rivals from the Republican primary. ’ ’   But as the convention draws near, the real question is who will   want the job. ’ ’   ”There’’s going to be a real examination by a lot of Republicans   whether they want to associate with him,” Parker told Business   Insider. ’
