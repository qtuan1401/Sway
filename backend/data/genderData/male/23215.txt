Amie Parnes writes in The Hill about the complaints among Clinton “allies and confidents” over her “lack of transparency about her health. ”[A lack of transparency about her health has turned what might have been a   into a hugely problematic storyline for Hillary Clinton that could plague the Democratic presidential nominee into November, say allies and confidants.  One ally described the string of events that culminated in Clinton leaving a Sept. 11 memorial early as a “  f —  ing nightmare. ” Clinton’s campaign sought to deal with the fallout on Monday of damaging video that showed Clinton’s knees buckling and Secret Service agents helping her into a van. The campaign later revealed that the Democratic nominee was suffering from pneumonia. David Axelrod, who served as a senior adviser to President Obama, slapped Clinton and the campaign for unnecessarily withholding information from the public. “Antibiotics can take care of pneumonia,” Axelrod wrote on Twitter. “What’s the cure for an unhealthy penchant for privacy that repeatedly creates unnecessary problems?” Behind the scenes, the criticism was even more withering.
