’  ’ ’   Presumptive Republican presidential nominee Donald Trump is   giving consideration to retired Lt. Gen. Michael Flynn as a   potential   running mate, a Republican source   familiar with the process told Reuters on Saturday. ’ ’   For weeks Trump has conducted a   canvassing of   Republican political stalwarts as part of his     search, but he has also made clear he is looking at what a   military leader would bring to the ticket. ’ ’   The source, speaking on condition of anonymity, said Flynn has   emerged as a possibility, confirming reports in the New York Post   and The Washington Post. The Trump campaign had no comment. ’ ’   Flynn, though  of Barack Obama, is a registered Democrat,   according to .  ’ ’   The thinking is that Flynn, who has been a   adviser   to Trump, would be able to help Trump in the area of national   security at a time of challenges abroad like the threat from   Islamic State militants. ’ ’’ ’   Trump is also considering a more conventional political choice   for his running mate, such as former House of Representatives   Speaker Newt Gingrich, Indiana Governor Mike Pence, or New Jersey   Governor Chris Christie. ’ ’   Flynn was chief of the Defense Intelligence Agency under   President Barack Obama from 2012 to 2014. ’ ’   He has spoken in the past about wanting the US to work more   closely with Russia to resolve global security issues. ’ ’   Flynn told Russia Today in an interview published on December 10   that the US and Russia should work together to resolve the Syrian   civil war and defeat Islamic State. ’ ”   He was pictured  just two seats away from Vladimir   Putin at a dinner honoring Russia Today, a media network   funded by Russia’s government, reports .  ” ’   Flynn has a book coming out next week, cowritten with Michael   Ledeen, titled: ”The Field of Fight: How We Can Win the Global   War Against Radical Islam and Its Allies.” ’ ’   (Reporting by Steve Holland; Editing by Leslie Adler and Business   Insider) ’
