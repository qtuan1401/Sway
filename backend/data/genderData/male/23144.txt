Friday on ABC’s “Good Morning America,” former strategist for George W. Bush Matthew Dowd said in light of Democratic presidential nominee Hillary Clinton’s minimal campaigning schedule and lack of a press conference, “It’s almost as if you have to put her face on a milk carton to find her. ”  When asked about Clinton’s email and Clinton Foundation scandals Dowd said, “I think this is a real problem for Hillary Clinton but —  and combined with the fact she has disappeared basically off the campaign trail. She hasn’t held a press conference in nine months. It’s almost as if you have to put her face on a milk carton to find her. She has to start confronting the press and have press conferences over the next few weeks in the   —  and basically turn this around again and turn it back on Donald Trump. If it becomes about her, she loses this race. ” He added, “She can’t wait for the debates. I think she needs to do a press conference before that to get a lot of it out in so it doesn’t dominate the debate. ” (  WFB, Follow Pam Key On Twitter @pamkeyNEN
