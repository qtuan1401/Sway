(Want to get this briefing by email? Here’s the  .) Good evening. Here’s the latest. 1. “The suspect said he was upset at white people. The suspect stated he wanted to kill white people, especially white officers. ” That was the Dallas police chief describing a verbal exchange with a sniper who killed these five officers and wounded seven people at a protest against police shootings late Thursday. “We’re hurting, our profession is hurting,” the police chief said. “There are no words to describe the atrocity that occurred to our city. ” _____ 2. The shooter was identified as an Army veteran, Micah Xavier Johnson, 25. He served as a mason and carpenter in Afghanistan. On Facebook, he “liked” a black power group, the African American Defense League, whose leader often calls for violence against the police. After an hourslong standoff in Dallas, the police killed him using an explosive delivered by robot. _____ 3. President Obama, in Warsaw, interrupted his final NATO summit meeting twice to comment on the violence in the U. S. Before the Dallas attack, he addressed the police shootings in Minnesota and Louisiana, calling them “symptomatic of a broader set of racial disparities that exist in our criminal justice system. ” After the five officers were killed, he said there was “no possible justification” for such a “vicious, calculated and despicable attack on law enforcement. ” Here’s what we know about all three episodes, which have deepened the painful national divide over race. _____ 4. Both Hillary Clinton and Donald Trump canceled campaign appearances and expressed concern for black citizens as well as solidarity with the police. Mrs. Clinton stressed pain and loss, while Mr. Trump issued a call for “law and order. ” He also made his first public comments about the police shootings in Louisiana and Minnesota, calling them “senseless tragic deaths” that show “how much needs to be done. ” But Texas’ lieutenant governor, Dan Patrick, called the Dallas protesters “hypocrites” for expecting police protection from the sniper while objecting to police shootings. _____ 5. The Labor Department delivered some positive economic news. Its monthly report said U. S. employment surged in June, with an increase of 287, 000 jobs and an uptick in wages. “Wow, this one takes my breath away,” an analyst in Chicago said. _____ 6. Roger Federer, above after a fall, lost his first Wimbledon   in a rough match that sent the Canadian Milos Raonic to his first Grand Slam final. He’ll face Andy Murray on Sunday for the men’s singles title (9 a. m. Eastern, ESPN). And Serena Williams faces Angelique Kerber, who beat her in January’s Australian Open final, on Saturday in the women’s singles final. (9 a. m. Eastern, ESPN). _____ 7. Britain’s slow march away from the European Union has produced at least one point of clarity: The next prime minister will be a woman. The Conservative Party has narrowed its options to succeed David Cameron down to Theresa May, above right, the home secretary (already called “The Iron Mayden” by tabs) and Andrea Leadsom, an energy minister, above left. But it will be months before the final choice is made. _____ 8.  In theaters this weekend: “Captain Fantastic. ” Our reviewer says that Viggo Mortensen’s captivating survivalist is the main reason to see the film, which follows him and his family into the the outside world. But she also says the insistence of the director, Matt Ross, “on taking your intelligence for granted is itself a great turn on. ” And here are our experts’ recommendations for streaming and TV this weekend. _____ 9. Finally, one of the fastest creatures in the ocean is the swordfish. Scientists think they have figured out why: A gland at the base of its sword secretes a   grease that coats its head. “This isn’t ordinary fish slime,” the lead author of a new study said.
