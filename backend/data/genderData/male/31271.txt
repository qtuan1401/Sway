Rosie O’Donnell reignited her   feud with Republican presidential candidate Donald Trump Friday, saying the real estate mogul is “not even qualified to run a game show. ”[“He is the worst representation of what the United States is or could be,” O’Donnell said in an interview on WABC. “He is everything we should reject as a nation. He’s like a bully for the mafia. Like he thinks that he can shut you up, like he’s Tony Soprano. ”  Last fall, the   show host called the Trump presidential campaign a “nightmare. ” Earlier this month, O’Donnell attacked Trump while singing a parody version of Grease. “There Are Worse Things I Can Do,” O’Donnell sang. “The only person who had the guts to stand up to him about it was Megyn Kelly,” O’Donnell said, referring to the popular Fox News host who has feuded with Trump in the past. “Megyn Kelly was a superhero, fighter for the truth when she said that, and he revealed who he was with his answer. ” O’Donnell also targeted GOP candidate Ted Cruz during her recent radio interview.  “He’s not worth my time to pay attention to,” she said. “He seems even, if possible, more dangerous than Donald Trump because he’s an actual politician. He’s dangerous, as well. ” O’Donnell also said she’s decided to back Hillary Clinton over Bernie Sanders. “She will win and Bernie Sanders will concede,” O’Donnell said of Sanders. “She will ask him to help her to get to the White House, which is the goal that will protect all of humanity as well as the nation’s reputation. ” Follow Jerome Hudson on Twitter @jeromeehudson
