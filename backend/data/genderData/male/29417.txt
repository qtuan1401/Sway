Wednesday at the Union League of Philadelphia, Republican presidential nominee Donald Trump said his Democratic opponent Hillary Clinton was “  and very unstable. ”  Trump said, “Clinton’s policies as secretary of state have left the Middle East in more disarray than ever before, not even close. Had we done nothing, we would have in far better position. Meanwhile, China has grown more aggressive and North Korea, more dangerous and belligerent than ever. Russia has defied this administration at every, single turn. Putin has no respect for President Obama, and has absolutely no respect for Hillary Clinton. Sometimes it seemed like there wasn’t a country in the Middle East that Hillary Clinton didn’t want to invade, intervene in, or topple. She’s trigger happy and very unstable. Whether we like it or not, that’s what’s going on. ” Follow Pam Key on Twitter @pamkeyNEN
