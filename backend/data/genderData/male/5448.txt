(Want to get this briefing by email? Here’s the  .) Good evening. Here’s the latest. 1. “Should the United Kingdom remain a member of the European Union or leave the European Union?” More than 46 million Britons have registered to vote  in Thursday’s referendum, and polls show a statistical dead heat. Proponents and opponents frantically campaigned for a final day. Twitter users tried to lighten the bitter debate, posting photos of their pets as #CatsAgainstBrexit, #DogsForBrexit and the like (even a few hamsters). _____ 2. Dozens of Democratic representatives staged a   on the House floor to demand that the Republican majority hold a vote on a   measure before a weeklong recess begins Friday. The Republican House leaders halted the session, cutting off the   broadcast of the Democratic protest. _____ 3. Donald Trump tried to refocus his campaign after a rough few days. He made his most sustained attack on Hillary Clinton, calling her “a   liar” in a speech that included many inaccurate and misleading statements. Mrs. Clinton, who on Tuesday criticized Mr. Trump’s business and economic ideas, laid out her vision for the U. S. economy. And the Libertarian Party’s candidates, former Gov. Gary Johnson of New Mexico and former Gov. Bill Weld of Massachusetts, held a town hall tonight. _____ 4. Wildfires burned in at least eight Western states and Alaska, with 31 clustered in a swath of Arizona and New Mexico blistered by a heat wave. Above, Los Angeles clouded in smoke. The Midwest braced for severe thunderstorms that could push across to the Eastern Seaboard. _____ 5. Sunday will see the formal opening of a new set of locks meant to ensure that the historic Panama Canal can handle the new, giant ships crucial to a hyperglobalized world of trade. But our investigation  —   interviews with contractors, canal workers, maritime experts and diplomats, and reviews of public and internal records  —   reveals construction flaws that leave the $3 billion project’s safety and economic viability in doubt. _____ 6. The golfer Rory McIlroy withdrew from the Rio Olympics because of concerns about the Zika virus, a   loss that may encourage more athletes to skip the Games. The event, set for August, has been diminished by the banning of Russia’s track and field team and Bulgaria’s   over doping. It has also been plagued by construction, pollution and national economic troubles in Brazil. _____ 7. One of the world’s longest conflicts appears to be nearing an end after more than 50 years. The Colombian government and FARC rebels said they had agreed to a   at talks in Havana and would hold a ceremony on Thursday. Peace is “not an illusion now, it’s a promise,” the rebels tweeted. _____ 8. A woman close to Prince described for the first time publicly what happened the night he blacked out on a private jet, just days before his fatal overdose. The singer Judith Hill, who was on the plane, said she raised an alarm after “his eyes fixed” and he became unconscious, forcing an emergency landing, treatment with an opioid blocker and hospitalization. She said he promised her that he would get help: “That’s the part that breaks my heart, because he was trying. ” _____ 9. Scientists reported an unnerving discovery: three species of clam that suffered from contagious cancer. The worry isn’t that they could infect humans  —   rather, that infectious cancers may be more widespread than previously understood. _____ 10. Discussions of   measures proliferated a day after a   visitor to Mark Zuckerberg’s Facebook page noticed that a photo showed his computer camera and microphone jack covered with tape. Security experts say those are sensible precautions everyone should consider, to prevent a takeover by a kind of malware called a   trojan  —   “ratting” for short. _____ 11. “i nvr felt this dark. ” One of our most riveting stories today retraces the steps of a    athlete from Columbus, Ohio, who committed suicide. A dedicated wrestler and football player proud of his tolerance for pain, Kosta Karageorge sustained at least 15 concussions. Tormented by erratic thoughts and excruciating headaches, he climbed into a garbage Dumpster and shot himself. _____ 12. Finally, more than a million fans flooded the streets of Cleveland to celebrate the Cavaliers’ N. B. A. title. Some slept on the streets overnight to get a good spot for the parade, which lasted more than four joyous hours. “I’m nothing without you all,” LeBron James said to crowds. “Get ready for next year. ” _____ Your Evening Briefing is posted at 6 p. m.
