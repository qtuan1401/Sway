Wednesday at a rally in Daytona Beach, FL, Republican presidential nominee Donald Trump said Democratic presidential nominee Hillary Clinton “should get an award from them as the founder of ISIS. ”  Trump said, “Look what has happened with your employment, look what happened with the whole history of space and leadership, look what is going on, folks. We’re like a third world nation. And then, you get back to crime. You see what’s happening with the police. You see what’s happening with —  take a look at Orlando. Take a look at San Bernardino. Take a look at the World Trade Center. Take a look at what’s going on —  then worldwide, and we let ISIS take this position. It was Hillary Clinton that —  she should get an award from them as the founder of ISIS. That’s what it was. That’s what it was —  her weakness —  her weak policies. ” Follow Pam Key on Twitter @pamkeyNEN
