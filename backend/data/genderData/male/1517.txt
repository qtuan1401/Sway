Welcome to the “hotel with the worst view in the world. ” Please be mindful of the   art on the walls. The elusive British street artist Banksy has decorated the interiors of the Walled Off Hotel, a   guesthouse in the West Bank city of Bethlehem whose windows overlook the barrier that separates the territory from Israel. Among the rooms decorated by the artist, who has earned a following for tagging walls around the world with witty illustrations and dark political commentaries, is the “Banksy Room. ” In the room, a mural on the wall above a   bed depicts a Palestinian and an Israeli locked in combat  —   only they are having a pillow fight. Banksy, who rarely comments on his work and keeps his real identity a secret, has made trips to the West Bank for years and has previously, under cover of night, painted the barrier itself. On a recent trip, he painted a mural on the barrier, just steps from his current project, showing a girl being pulled aloft by balloons. Last year, four street murals in Gaza were attributed to him, including one depicting a Greek goddess amid the rubble of a destroyed house. In addition to the guest rooms, Banksy has created something of a museum that includes surveillance cameras mounted like taxidermic trophies, a Grecian bust surrounded by a cloud meant to depict tear gas, and a wax statue depicting the signing of the Balfour Declaration, the 1917 letter of British intent to create a Jewish homeland in Palestine. The hotel will open to guests on March 11, with rooms starting at $30 a night. Banksy, who first came to prominence by stenciling artworks on the walls of Bristol, England, has become an international superstar. In 2015, he created an exhibit called Dismaland, in which works by Israeli and Palestinian artists were displayed side by side. Some of Banksy’s works have sold at auction for more than $1 million.
