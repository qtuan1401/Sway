In a move seemingly aimed at easing the fears of social conservatives ahead of the important South Carolina primary, presidential hopeful Donald Trump told CBN’s David Brody Thursday that he would defund Planned Parenthood. [Trump also said that Roe v. Wade “was wrongly decided” and that he would appoint “constitutionalist judges. ”  Trump said he would defund Planned Parenthood “because as long as they do the abortion I am not for funding Planned Parenthood. They do other good work. You look at cervical cancer. I’ve had women tell me they do some excellent work so I think you also have to put that into account but I would defund Planned Parenthood because of their view and the fact of their work on abortion. ” On Roe v. Wade, Trump told Brody, “It’s been very strongly decided but it can be changed. Things are put there and they’re passed but they can be unpassed with time but it’s going to take time because you have a lot of judges to go. ” “I will put people on that are going to be very very good and constitutionalists and they’re going to do a good job but it’s going to take a long time,” he said. It is unclear if this will bring   into the Trump camp. To date they have largely been vociferous in their opposition. This week, a group of influential social conservatives issued a strong condemnation in the form of questions. The Trump candidacy has been strongly criticized by both Marjorie Danenfelser of the Susan B. Anthony List and Charmaine Yoest of Americans United for Life.
