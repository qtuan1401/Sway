’  ’ ’   A spokesperson for Donald Trump denied Wednesday a New York Times   story in which  the Republican presidential   nominee had made unwanted sexual advances toward them years ago. ’ ’   “This entire article is fiction, and for the New York Times to   launch a completely false, coordinated character assassination   against Mr. Trump on a topic like this is dangerous,” said Jason   Miller, senior communications adviser for Trump, in a statement. ’ ’   Miller added: “To reach back decades in an attempt to smear Mr.   Trump trivializes sexual assault, and it sets a new low for where   the media is willing to go in its efforts to determine this   election. ” ’ ’   Trump threatened to sue The Times for publishing the story and   called one of the reporters who authored it a “disgusting human   being. ” ’ ’   The Times report was published just days after a  of Trump boasting about how   he used his fame to kiss and grope women. In one instance, Trump   said he could grab women by the genitalia because “when you’re a   star” they allowed it. ’ ’’ ’   Trump has dismissed the tape as “locker room talk” and said he   never actually engaged in such conduct. ’ ’   ”It is absurd to think that one of the most recognizable business   leaders on the planet with a strong record of empowering women in   his companies would do the things alleged in this story,” Miller   said, “and for this to only become public decades later in the   final month of a campaign for president should say it all. ” ’
