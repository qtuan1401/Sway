’  ’ ’   WikiLeaks founder Julian Assange said Thursday that he would’’ve   had ”no problem” releasing similar information   on   Donald Trump as his organization   did related to Democratic presidential nominee Hillary   Clinton. ’ ”   In an interview on Fox News host Sean Hannity’s radio   program, Assange said that in four years, he might release hacked   information on Trump  —   if Trump should upset someone that ends up   providing WikiLeaks with such documents. ” ”   Assange also would not say how he received the hacked emails from   Clinton’s campaign chair, John Podesta, which his organization   leaked in a prolonged fashion throughout October leading up to   Election Day, seemingly to create maximum effect.  ” ’   US intelligence has pointed to Russia being involved in hacking   political organizations and operatives in the United States, with   the  on Thursday going as far to   suggest that Russian President Vladimir Putin was directly   involved in the operation. ’ ’   But Assange said he did not received the hacked documents that he   dumped from Russian sources, although he pointed to two other   prominent leak outlets  —   Guccifer 2. 0 and DC Leaks  —   as   appearing to be tied to the Russians. However, he said the   appearance was so overwhelming that it might have been   specifically to make people think the two operations were   operating in coordination with Russia. ’ ’’ ’   The WikiLeaks founder is currently under asylum living in the   Ecuadorian embassy in London to avoid extradition to Sweden,   where he faces allegations of sexual assault. ’ ’ in   hacking have increased in   recent days and come from both sides of the aisle following a   pair of Washington Post and New York Times reports that said the   CIA has determined Russia interfered in the campaign to try to   tip the scales toward Trump. The   has   resisted those calls. ’
