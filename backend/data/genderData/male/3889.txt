Hillary Clinton and Donald Trump continued to battle it out, making sequential   appearances at a forum on national security. Ahead of the event, Mr. Trump proposed ending caps on military spending. Both candidates lay claim to major backing from the military. If you feel whipsawed by polls that seem uncertain about how much Mr. Trump has gained on Mrs. Clinton, one of our   experts explains the fluctuations and reassures us that   polls over the next few weeks are likely to be highly predictive. _____ 2. Defense Secretary Ashton Carter lashed out at Russia, which the F. B. I. believes hacked into the Democratic National Committee’s computer systems.

The preservationist architect on the project, who resigned last year over differences, said, “He does not deserve this building. ” _____ 4. Apple announced a range of updates and improvements across its full line at its annual product showcase, but the big focus was the new iPhone 7. Its lack of a headphone jack means the device can be   (oh be joyful) the company can sell wireless earbuds (ouch, $160) and the future looks a lot less like a tangle of wires.

Signs of fall are everywhere: Leaves are turning, football is nigh, and New York has begun Fashion Week.
