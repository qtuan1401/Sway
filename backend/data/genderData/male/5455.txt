WASHINGTON  —   The Senate voted on Thursday to keep a proposal to block gun sales to terrorism suspects alive, but placed it in a procedural limbo that made its adoption unlikely anytime soon. The compromise measure, drafted by Senator Susan Collins, Republican of Maine, had emerged as the one piece of legislation since the mass shooting in Orlando, Fla. with a chance of winning bipartisan support and passage in Congress. The measure, which had been in danger of failing because of Republican opposition, would block gun sales to anyone on the government’s   list or the   “selectee” list of people subjected to heightened screening before they are allowed to board a plane. Republican leaders, however, had expressed deep misgivings about the bill because they said it would deny due process to individuals who might have ended up on the lists without just cause. That left them in a quandary of how to stall the measure without allowing Democrats to gloat that Republicans were so opposed to tighter gun restrictions that they defeated even a bill offered by a member of their own party. The solution was a procedural maneuver by which the majority leader, Mitch McConnell, Republican of Kentucky, scheduled the bill for a vote on a motion to table it. By voting not to table it, Republicans could keep it alive without advancing or defeating it outright  —   putting it in a sort of legislative purgatory. Supporters of the measure sought to preserve some hope, but it was a reach. “It is absolutely not dead,” said Senator Heidi Heitkamp, Democrat of North Dakota, who was a main partner with Ms. Collins in drafting the proposal and selling it to Democrats. But asked whether the measure was still alive, Ms. Heitkamp was less certain. “Well, we’ll see,” she replied.
