’  ’ ’   Comedian Samantha Bee apologized Thursday for inadvertently   including a man with brain cancer in a segment about ”Nazi hair”   at the Conservative Political Action Conference. ’ ’   A segment on an episode of ”Full Frontal” this week observed that   one style of haircut,  was especially prevalent at CPAC this   year. The segment featured shots of young men with the   haircut, which is short on the sides and long and slicked back on   top. ’ ’   ”Just last year, CPAC was dominated by Ted Cruz supporters and   chirpy little      with bow ties,” a narrator says in the   segment. ”. .. This year, the bow ties were gone and replaced   by Nazi hair.” ’ ’   But one of the men featured in the segment recently found out   that he has brain cancer, as his sister subsequently said on   Twitter: ’ ’ ’ ’ ’t’t’tWhen  makes fun of your brother for having ”Nazi hair.” He actually has stage 4 brain cancer, but whatever floats your boat.  ’ ’   Bee responded in a tweet hours later: ’ ’ ’ ’  We deeply apologize for offending you and . We only learned of his condition today & have removed him from the piece’t’t’ ’   Kyle also tweeted at Bee: ’ ’ ’ ’  😭😭😭 Please delete this episode. I look like a balding potato.  ’ ”  Also, it’s not a Nazi haircut. Richard Spencer’s is, but mine’s from cancer. 🤷🏼’u200d♂️🤷🏼’u200d♂️’t’t” ’   The ”Nazi hair” part of the segment has been cut, and the    now on the ”Full Frontal” YouTube channel now has   narration that says, ”This year, the bow ties were gone and CPAC   was decidedly Trump country.” ’ ’   ”Full Frontal” executive producer Jo Miller said  that the show had   ”apologized to Mr. Coddington and his family members” and would   donate money toward his cancer treatment. ’ ’   ”We wish him all the best in his fight against cancer and   sincerely, deeply regret offending him and his family,” Miller   said. ’ ’Comedian Samantha Bee apologized Thursday for. ..’ ’’ ’’ ’’
