Former Alaska governor and 2008 GOP vice presidential nominee Sarah Palin offered her congratulations to Indiana governor Mike Pence on being chosen as Donald Trump’s running mate. [Palin posted the following to her Facebook page: CONGRATULATIONS PENCE FAMILY Illegitimi non carborundum, In this clash of civilizations, the courageous, unrelenting fight for America’s future is beyond paramount. If eyes are not open to this after the latest Islamic attack, then one may be hopelessly lost in the fake utopian world into which the Left sucks the gullible. Congratulations to Gov. Mike Pence on being chosen to run for Vice President. Pence is an accomplished Indiana politician with decades of politics under his belt. He is a devoted family man, and he is a gentleman. He will serve well as Trump’s partner Trump’s second in command. Commonsense, independent patriots must now be wholly united and involved in this election process. Recognizing the nation’s enemies hellbent on decimating us militarily and economically, it’s wise to insist gentlemanly politics to take a back seat to the fighting Warrior spirit that must drive all our leaders in this upcoming epic battle for America’s security, solvency and sovereignty. A GOP team is now set to win that battle through strengthening our military, our Supreme Court, our balance sheet, and our common resolve to finally put America first. Congratulations to the Pence family: stand your ground and fight alongside your dad through the coming months and years of scrutiny. Illegitimi non carborundum.  —   Sarah Palin
