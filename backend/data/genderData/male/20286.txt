Jim Downs, a writer for the popular LGBT magazine The Advocate, has declared that homosexual billionaire Peter Thiel can’t be gay because he’s a conservative he just has gay sex. [“Peter Thiel, the Silicon Valley billionaire who made news this summer for endorsing Donald Trump at the Republican convention, is a man who has sex with other men. But is he gay?” asked Downs. “By the logic of gay liberation, Thiel is an example of a man who has sex with other men, but not a gay man. Because he does not embrace the struggle of people to embrace their distinctive identity. ”  Referencing Thiel’s endorsement of Republican presidential candidate Donald Trump and his support for conservative and libertarian principles, Downs claims, “In this way, Thiel reaffirmed his own sexual choices  —   while separating himself from gay identity. His notion that transgender people’s predicament is somehow a distraction effectively rejects the conception of LGBT as a cultural identity that requires political struggle to defend. ” “The gay liberation movement has left us a powerful legacy,” he concluded. “And protecting that legacy requires understanding the meaning of the term ‘gay’ and not using it simply as a synonym for   desire and intimacy”.
