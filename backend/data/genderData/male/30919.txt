Donald Trump’s campaign is spending $25 million on a media buy ahead of the general election, which is in just seven days. [The Trump campaign is going on offense, targeting a few traditionally blue states as well as key battle ground states, including: Florida, Colorado, Iowa, Michigan, Maine, New Mexico, Ohio, North Carolina, Wisconsin, Nevada, Virginia, Pennsylvania and New Hampshire.  “The data clearly shows that Mr. Trump’s message is reaching voters and we are expanding the map,” Trump’s campaign Digital Director Brad Parscale stated in a press release, adding: This addition to our already aggressive paid media outreach illustrates Mr. Trump’s commitment to reaching out to all voters in   states before Election Day. While Mr. Trump continues to climb in the polls and accelerate outreach in states like Michigan and New Mexico that are rarely won by Republican Presidential candidates, Hillary Clinton is preoccupied fighting the sitting FBI Director and President Obama over yet another email scandal. By increasing our presence in battleground states and expanding into new markets, Mr. Trump is   for an impressive victory on Nov. 8th. Hillary Clinton’s campaign has restarted ad buys in Colorado and Wisconsin, according to the Trump campaign press release, which suggests that shows “their nervousness about key battleground states. ”
