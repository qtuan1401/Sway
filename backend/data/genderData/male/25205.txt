On this weekend’s broadcast of “Fox New Sunday,” veteran journalist Bob Woodward said Democratic presidential nominee Hillary Clinton’s family organization the Clinton Foundation was “corrupt. ”  Partial transcript as follows: WALLACE: Then there are the allegations about the Clinton Foundation and pay to play, which I asked Secretary Clinton about in the debate, and she turned into an attack on the Trump Foundation. But, Bob, I want to go back to the conversation I was having with Robby Mook before. When  —   when you see what seems to be clear evidence that Clinton Foundation donors were being treated differently than   in terms of access, when you see this new  —   new revelation about the $12 million deal between Hillary Clinton, the foundation, and the king of Morocco, are voters right to be troubled by this? BOB WOODWARD, THE WASHINGTON POST: I  —   yes, it’s a  —   it’s corrupt. It’s  —   it’s a scandal. And she didn’t answer your question at all. And she turned to embrace the good work that the Clinton Foundation has done. And she has a case there. But the mixing of speech fees, the Clinton Foundation, and actions by the State Department, which she ran, are all intertwined and it’s corrupt. You know, I mean, you can’t just say it’s unsavory. But there’s no formal investigation going on now, and there are outs that they have. But the election isn’t going to be decided on that. Follow Pam Key on Twitter @pamkeyNEN
