One name? SCHUMER: I’m not going to pick a name. If he continues at the rate —   HUNT: Who is the leader of the Democratic party, you? SCHUMER: We have a bunch of leaders. I’m the leader of the Senate and try to represent the Democratic Party, but we have a bunch of good voices. It’s much too premature to handicap  . But I’ll tell you this if the president continues this way, there is even a chance we could take back the Senate. Follow Pam Key on Twitter @pamkeyNEN
