’  ’ ’   Hillary Clinton lambasted Donald Trump on Thursday for mocking a   pastor  during his appearance at her church in Flint,   Michigan, Wednesday. ’ ’   Trump called her ”a nervous mess” in a Thursday morning interview   with ”Fox & Friends.” ’ ’   Before taking questions from reporters in Greensboro, North   Carolina, Clinton called the pastor, Rev. Faith     Trump’’s ”latest target.” ’ ’   ”His latest target is a pastor from Flint, Michigan, who   respectfully asked him not to use her pulpit for political   attacks,” Clinton said. ”He called her ’’a nervous mess. ’’” ’ ’   ”That’’s not only insulting, it’’s dead wrong,” she continued.   ”Rev. Faith   is not a nervous mess, she’’s a rock for   her community in trying times. She deserves better than that, and   Flint deserves better. In fact, so does America.” ’ ’   the Republican nominee accused   of planning to   come onstage to cut off his remarks when he addressed her   congregation. ’ ’   ”When she got up to introduce me she was so nervous, she was   shaking,” Trump said. ”And I said, ’’Wow this is sort of strange. ’’   And then she came up. So she had that in mind. There was no   question about it.” ’ ’   ”She was so nervous,” he added. ”She was like a nervous mess. And   so I figured something was up. Really.” ’ ”   Several minutes into Trump’s remarks at Bethel United Methodist   Church on Wednesday, she reminded the Manhattan   billionaire that the event was intended to focus on the     recovery in Flint, where state   measures   resulted in lead contamination in the city’s water supply. ” ’   ”Mr. Trump, I invited you here to thank us for what we’’ve done   for Flint, not to give a political speech,” . ’ ’   ”Oh, OK, OK, OK, that’’s good,” Trump said. ”Then I’’m going to go   back on to Flint.”  ’ ’ ’ ’Hillary Clinton: Donald Trump’’s ”latest target is a pastor in Flint, Michigan”  ’
