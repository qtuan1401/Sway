Michelle Fields suggests Dave Aronberg, the prosecutor who dropped battery charges against Corey Lewandowski, may have a conflict of interest that, if she were in his shoes, would have led to recusal from the case. [From the Daily Beast:  Fields suggested that Palm Beach County District Attorney Dave Aronberg’s decision not to prosecute Lewandowski after police charged and arrested him was unethical and motivated by personal concerns. This is because Aronberg and his wife Lynn, a former Miami Dolphins cheerleader who owns a public relations firm, have been frequent visitors to Trump’s private club,    and that Lynn Aronberg has posted numerous photos of herself posing with Donald and Melania Trump on her Facebook page and company web site. “If my wife was trying to monetize her relationship with Donald Trump,” Fields told Stelter, “I would recuse myself from the situation and the case. ” Fields added: “The entire situations just seem to me a little sketchy  …    She’s at     …    all the time. On her firm’s web site  …    the first picture is her and Donald Trump and her and Melania. ” Fields insisted that, contrary to claims by Trump and Aronberg’s office, she never touched the candidate, who moved his right arm away from her in order to retrieve a pen from his jacket pocket in order to sign autographs as he made his way out of the golf club ballroom. She also pointed out that Aronberg’s office, far from conducting the thorough investigation that was promised, didn’t even interview the main witness to the grabbing incident, Washington Post reporter Ben Terris.
