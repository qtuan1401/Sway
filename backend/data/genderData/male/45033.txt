’Geopolitical analyst and president of the Ian Bremmer explains how North Korea is more capable and dangerous now than it has been in recent memory, and how a Trump administration could lead to a real breakthrough or a real war. Following is a transcript of the video.’ ”Over the past 15, 20 years, the North Korea situation has looked like a normal distribution. In other words, you’d have a very thin outcome, thin likelihood of a breakthrough that could bring peace, a very thin likelihood of war, and just this general status quo of a rogue state that treats its people like dirt, like animals.” ”Now, you have an environment where it’s gotten a lot worse, where they’re much more dangerous, where they’re much more willing and capable to cause problems internationally.” ”Trump, as president focused on these issues, has basically taken both of the thin, tail end distribution outcomes in North Korea, and he’s made them bigger.” ’There’’s a real possibility that Trump could actually say to the North Koreans, ”I’’m prepared to meet with Kim Jong Un.” And there could be a real breakthrough. And he could get  —   if that happened, he gets a Nobel. Frankly, he’’d deserve a Nobel for that much more than Obama did for his. There’’s no question there.’ ”But there’s also a real possibility of a war. The fact that Trump has said that it is unacceptable for the North Koreans to develop the capability to hit the American homeland, at least California and the west coast, that he’ll stop them, he won’t let them do that.”
