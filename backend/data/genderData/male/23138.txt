According to the latest exit polls out of New Hampshire, 54% of GOP voters said the recent debates were “important” in their candidate decision. Another 10% described the debates as “very important. ” That is almost   of voters and probably bad news for Marco Rubio,  who not only had a very poor showing in the most recent debate, but was pummeled in the   discussion, as well.  Trump boycotting the Fox News debate that took place a week prior might also prove consequential. However, by most accounts, he had a very good Saturday night.  —   Not good for Rubio. pic. twitter.   —   John Nolte (@NolteNC) February 9, 2016,
