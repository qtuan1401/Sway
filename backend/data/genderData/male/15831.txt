A new poll finds that GOP nominee Donald Trump is tightening the polls even in liberal Minnesota where Hillary Clinton’s lead has been cut in half since last week. [A poll taken of 625 registered Minnesota voters ending on September 14 found that Hillary’s     lead in the deep blue state has been slashed to 6 points, according to the Minneapolis  .  Clinton now leads Trump 44 to 38 percent. But only a few months ago that spread was at 48 percent for Clinton to Trump’s 35 percent. While the state’s big cities favor Clinton 58 percent to Trump’s 28 percent, it is the outlying areas and suburbs where the GOP nominee is gaining. In the suburban areas, for instance, Trump leads Clinton 41 to 37 percent while, in the rural sectors of the North Star State, Trump tops Clinton by a more lopsided 44 to 28 percent. In addition, independents are choosing Trump over Clinton by a wide margin with 42 percent going for Trump and 32 percent for Clinton. The poll also found that fully ten percent of respondents are still undecided. The survey taken from September 12 to 14 has a margin of error at plus or minus four points.
