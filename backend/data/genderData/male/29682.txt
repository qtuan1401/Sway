On this weekend’s broadcast of “Fox News Sunday,”   Donald Trump’s incoming chief of staff Reince Priebus denied there was “open warfare” between Trump advisers and loyalists over the possibility of  former Gov. Mitt Romney ( ) being tapped as secretary of state.  Priebus said, “There are a lot of opinions as far as this topic and many other cabinet positions, but I think what   Trump has said is that, as he said the entire campaign, he’s going to hire the best people possible. He’s going through this process, He’s interviewed Governor Romney, he’s talked to the mayor, he’s talked to others like General Kelly. He’s going to be talking to others next week. He’s going to make the best decision for the American people. ” “It’s not about warfare,” he continued. “Yes, there is a lot of  opinion about this. This is sort of a team of rivals context if he does go with governor Romney, but that should tell Americans where   Trump’s head is, which is a place that will put the best possible place together for all Americans, whatever your religion, whatever your opinion is. He wants to move forward looking through the windshield and not the rear view mirror, and that’s where the  ’s head is at. And I think it’s a great place for Americans. ” Follow Pam Key on Twitter @pamkeyNEN
