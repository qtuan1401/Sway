Establishment Republicans are looking to retired senator Tom Coburn or retired Texas governor Rick Perry as possible   options if they can’t stop Donald Trump at a brokered convention in Cleveland. [Neoconservative pundit Bill Kristol, son of Irving, has been one of the leading forces trying to broker the convention to throw out the will of the people if Donald Trump fails to make it to 1, 237 delegates before July. But even if Trump reaches 1, 237, Kristol and the gang are considering running a   candidate against him to split the vote, ensure that Hillary Clinton wins, and keep control of the party that is slipping out of their grasp.  The New York Times reported Saturday: “It’s childish nonsense,” Gingrich said, on the idea of a   brokered convention. “There are two potential presidential nominees. One is named Donald. One is named Ted. The idea that some clever Washington intellectual or power broker  —   put quote marks around ‘power broker’ —   can step into an election in which millions have voted and magically change the trajectory of history? It’s goofy. There’s two players standing. ”
