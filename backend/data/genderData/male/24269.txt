Pop singer Kesha is pushing gun control, saying no one can “control every single person” but “we can control  …    who we give the f**king weapons to. ”[Kesha was playing a late night concert coinciding with the Democrat National Convention in Philadelphia, at an event sponsored by Gabby Gifford’s gun control group, Americans for Responsible Solutions.  According to The Hill, Kesha played a four song set. Halfway through the set she stopped and said she “needed to say something. ” She then said: We as a nation, we can’t control who feels hurt, we can’t control who feels pain. You can’t control every single person and know how they’re going to deal with things and know if they’re going to pick up a weapon  —   you don’t know that. But what we can control is who we give the f**king weapons to. She added, “I think the universe is screaming at us that there needs to be a change, and we have to f**king listen. ” Kesha then launched into a song titled, “Dirty Love. ” Gabby Giffords also spoke at the event, saying, “Stopping gun violence takes courage. The courage to do what’s right, the courage of new ideas. ” Giffords has began pushing to require every   gun purchaser to pass a background check ever since Jared Loughner passed a background check to acquire the gun he used to wound her on January 8, 2011.
