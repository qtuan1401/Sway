That   is all I am telling you,” he was quoted as telling the newspaper. ’ ”   Trump will host Chinese President Xi Jinping this Thursday and   Friday at his    resort in Florida, where the two leaders   are expected to discuss North Korea, China’s ambitions in the   South China Sea and trade. ” ’   ”China has great influence over North Korea. And China will   either decide to help us with North Korea, or they won’’t,” he was   quoted as saying in the paper. ’ ’   Trump’’s Deputy National Security Adviser K. T. McFarland said   there is a ”real possibility” North Korea could be capable of   hitting the United States with a   missile by the end   of Trump’’s first term, the newspaper reported. ’ ’’ ’   Intelligence experts disagree with McFarland’’s assessment and say   North Korea’’s ability to launch a nuclear missile is at least   ”years away.” ’ ’     ’ ’   (Reporting by Timothy Ahman and Valerie Volcovici; Editing by   Sandra Maler) ’ ’WASHINGTON (Reuters)   The United States is. ..’ ’’ ’’ ’’
