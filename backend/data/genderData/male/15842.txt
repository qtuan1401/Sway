Hillary Clinton is garnering heartland criticism for her bizarre speech this week attacking Trump campaign CEO Steve Bannon, Breitbart News, and the   “Alt Right” as an Axis of Evil that inspires racism on the Internet. [Republican Party of Iowa chairman Jeff Kaufmann is not too impressed with this line of attack, especially considering that it came on the heels of a   week for Clinton.  “Hillary Clinton’s latest strategy of deflecting from her corrupt    scheme at the State Department by leveling personal attacks against Donald Trump is as desperate as it is predictable,” Kaufmann said in a statement provided to Breitbart News. “For decades, Hillary and other Democrats have taken minority support for granted while offering them embarrassingly little results.  Donald Trump’s powerful message of hope, opportunity and empowerment for minority communities threatens to resonate with Hillary’s base, and that’s why she’s lashing out,” Kaufmann said. Kaufmann is building a fiercely competitive ground game for Trump in the Hawkeye State. “Iowa will have the largest ground game ever for Republicans,” state party chairman Jeff Kaufmann told Breitbart News on a conference call with reporters Wednesday. “We will be ready. ” “I don’t think in Iowa it ever left the tracks,” Kaufmann said, referring to the Trump campaign in Iowa. “It’s been a dogfight the entire time. I haven’t seen any  . We’re going after every vote. ”
