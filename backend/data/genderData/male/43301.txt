’  ’ ”   David Einhorn’s latest investment letter just dropped. ” ’   The hedge fund legend and founder of Greenlight Capital returned   4. 5% in the fourth quarter, taking the    return to   8. 4% according to the letter. The fund has now returned 2, 090%   since its inception in 1996, or 16. 1% annualized. ’ ’   ”Since Election Day, the market appears to have changed its   macroeconomic outlook and is   the prospects for many   companies accordingly,” the letter said. ”This change in tone has   been favorable to our style, and we generated a good result in   the quarter despite our low net exposure and a decline in gold.” ’ ’   The letter also runs through what a Trump presidency might mean   for markets. ’ ’   ”We believe that the   Recession easy money policies   have been good for Wall Street but bad for Main Street,” the   letter said. ”It’s possible that the TP [Trump presidency]   reverses these policies, which would be good for Main Street but   rough on Wall Street.” ’ ’’ ’     Trump is focused on increasing economic growth   and employment, according to the letter. Given unemployment is   already at 5% this could create inflation, forcing the Fed to   raise rates. ’ ’   ”In the near term, this stimulus combined with the benefit to   savers will add fuel to an accelerating economy and a tightening   job market,” the letter said. ”Ultimately, wage inflation could   become a drag on corporate profitability and higher inflation may   force the Fed to raise rates substantially, potentially causing   the next recession.” ’ ’   With that in mind, Greenlight set out a bunch of thoughts on   positioning for a Trump presidency. Here they are: ’ ’”Long a variety of     U. S.       value stocks.” The letter names AMERCO, Chemours,       Dillard’’s, and DSW as ”generally full federal   with       healthy profits.”     ’ ’”Long AAPL.” The tech giant stands to       benefit from repatriation of foreign cash, with over $200       billion in cash overseas.     ’ ’Short ”bubble basket.” These stocks       don’’t have profits and therefore don’’t benefit from tax       reform. In addition, ”an accelerating economy should allow       investors to find growth without needing to pay nosebleed       prices for a narrow group of profitless   growth       stocks.”     ’ ’”Short oil frackers.” The economics still       don’’t work out for frackers, according to Greenlight. ”We       thought the well of investors willing to sink cash into         holes would begin to run dry, but the       ’’  ’’ attitude of a TP is likely to lead to       additional ” the note said.     ’ ’”Short CAT (and a few other similar       industrial cyclicals that have moved muchhigher  ).” Investors have been       buying Caterpillar stock as it stands to benefit from       infrastructure spending, according to the letter. Caterpillar       machines are indeed used to build infrastructure, but that is       only a small portion of its business, according to the       letter. ”CAT’s biggest segments are mining and energy,” the       letter said. ”We just completed a     boom       in iron ore mine development, and horizontal drilling means       we can produce more oil with fewer rigs.”     ’
