Tuesday in an interview that aired on Fox News Channel’s “Fox  Friends,” President Donald Trump reacted to comments from House Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi over the weekend saying his administration has “done nothing. ”  Trump called Pelosi “incompetent” and pointed to the current state of the Democratic Party as evidence. “Well, I’ve been watching Nancy’s statements, and I think she’s incompetent, actually,” Trump said. “You know if you look at what’s going on with the Democrats and the party, it’s getting smaller and smaller. You know, in a certain way I hate to see it because I like a   system. And we’re soon going to have a   system. I actually think a   system is healthy and good. But she’s done a terrible job. ” “I don’t think she’s a good spokesman,” he added. “She’s certainly wrong. There are those who say I’ve done more than anybody in a hundred days. ” Follow Jeff Poor on Twitter @jeff_poor
