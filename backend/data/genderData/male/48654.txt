’  ’ ”   Michael Brendan Dougherty, senior correspondent for The Week and   former Business Insider politics editor, says : Trump doesn’t need to tone   it down in Monday night’s debate. If he wants to win, he has to   dial up the aggression: ” ”   I think this is right. Trump’s bugs are also his features, and   many of the people telling him to tone it down now are the same   people who told him (incorrectly) that he needed to tone it down   to win the primary. ” ”   Trump doesn’t need to seem normal and safe; he needs to make the   case that it is worth taking the risk of his presidency.   The last thing he should do is appear  . ” ”   But Dougherty ’s advice also reflects how hard it will be for   Trump to use the debate to his advantage. ” ’’ ’   Dougherty argues Trump needs to deploy ”controlled aggression”   that puts Clinton and the whole establishment that backs her on   the defensive. But when Trump feels attacked, he does not do   ”controlled aggression” well. ’ ’     Trump is prone to mistakes  —   mistakes that are more   likely to alienate general election voters than primary voters,   and mistakes that are more likely to be   when they   occur opposite a female opponent than a field of men. ’ ”   Unlike in March, Trump won’t be able to  in this debate without   penalty. ” ”   Maybe Trump will be able to thread the needle of being bombastic   without alienating voters already worried about his temperament   and his competence. But there’s nothing in his track record that   suggests he’s up to the task. ”
