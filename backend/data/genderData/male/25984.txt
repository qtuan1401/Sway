On Saturday, MSNBC interviewed Dane Waters of Delegates Unbound, a group trying to get the Republican National Convention to adopt rules that allow delegates to “unbind” themselves from the GOP’s Donald Trump.  Waters said that not unbinding the delegates is “an assault to democracy. ” “The delegates are angry. They are angry, outraged at what happened. What we’re there to do is help them make it clear to the rest of the world that they are outraged, they’re unhappy and they’re angry, unhappy. What happened is an assault to democracy, in my opinion. It flies in the face of everything the Republican party stands for and can’t be allowed to stand,” Waters told MSNBC’s Jacob Soboroff. Follow Trent Baker on Twitter @MagnifiTrent
