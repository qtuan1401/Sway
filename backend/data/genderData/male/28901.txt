Kristin Tate, author of Government Gone Wild: How D. C. Politicians Are Taking You For a Ride, tells Breitbart News Daily on SiriusXM that GOP frontrunner Donald Trump should pick a female vice presidential running mate. [“I think Trump would be very wise to choose a female vice president. I think that GOP women are not so much are afraid [of] Trump, but a lot of independent voters and undecided voters probably buy into the media that Trump is a bigoted,   candidate,” she says. “And unfortunately the media is only going to   on these attacks if he becomes the nominee. So I think a woman running mate would be great for Trump and I think it would help him a lot with the general public. ”  “Unfortunately, politics is a lot about this stuff,” she said, alluding to identity politics. “So he needs someone  —   if he just gets another old white man to be the best old white man with the best ideas, the media is going to spin that as these are two old white men  —   bigots. ” “So, unfortunately, politics is a lot about presentation and messaging, and if he has a woman with him, I think it’ll really, really help calm the media attacks. Which the media attacks are not all just, but unfortunately a lot of people are buying into this stuff. ” Breitbart News Daily airs on SiriusXM Patriot 125 weekdays from 6 AM to 9 AM EST. LISTEN:
