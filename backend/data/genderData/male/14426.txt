Rally attendees fought back, driving the antifa off a fair distance after one of their own smoke bombs was blown into their lines by the prevailing wind. Police told the Los Angeles Times that sixteen people were arrested and nine people were injured. Six had to attend the hospital for treatment, including one stabbing victim. One attendee, Donald Trump supporter AJ Alegria, described how he was surrounded by a dozen   activists, pepper sprayed and beaten with sticks. “These people create violence all the time  …     somebody has to stand up to them,” he said.
