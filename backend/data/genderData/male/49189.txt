’  ’ ’   Donald Trump on Sunday said Hillary Clinton was ”being protected   by a rigged system,” hours after  in its   investigation into her use of a private email server. ’ ’   ”Right now she is being protected by a rigged system. It’’s a   totally rigged system,” the Republican presidential nominee said   at a rally in Minnesota. ”I’’ve been saying it for a long time.” ’ ’   The FBI director, James Comey,  that his team had been   ”working around the clock” to process the newly discovered emails   since he announced a little over a week ago that the   investigation had been renewed. ’ ’   ”We reviewed all communications that were to or from Hillary   Clinton while she served as secretary of state,” Comey wrote in   his letter to Congress. ”Based on our review, we have not changed   our conclusions that we expressed in July with respect to   Secretary Clinton.” ’ ”   Trump, however, cast doubt on the FBI director’s methods. ” ’’ ’   ”You can’’t review 650, 000 new emails in eight days,” Trump said.   ”You can’’t do it, folks. Hillary Clinton is guilty. She knows it,   the FBI knows it, the people know it.” ’ ’   The New York businessman said it was now up to voters to hold   Clinton accountable. ’ ’   ”Now it is up to the American people to deliver justice at the   ballot box on November 8,” he said. ”It’’s unbelievable. It’’s   unbelievable what she gets away with.” ’ ’   Trump had been using the latest FBI investigation to attack   Clinton. In the past week, he and his surrogates used every   opportunity they got to suggest the investigation would   ultimately lead to an indictment that could  should she be elected. ’ ’   With just two days to go until Election Day, both Clinton and   Trump were furiously crisscrossing the US in a frantic     push to turn out the vote in key battleground states. ’ ’   Polls in recent days have  though analysts still   favor Clinton to emerge as the victor Tuesday night. ’
