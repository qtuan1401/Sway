Vice President of the   Cynthia and George Mitchell Foundation, Marilu Hastings, discussed her recent US News   titled “Rick Perry’s Green Energy Story” with Breitbart News Daily SiriusXm host Alex Marlow on Monday. [Hastings wrote in US News, “While former Texas Gov. Rick Perry is a   climate change denier, under his watch Texas became a leader in the U. S.’s transition to a clean energy economy. Perry’s   rhetoric, and his hostility toward regulation, justifiably provoke skepticism. Yet, as governor, Perry’s actions  —   a combination of smart energy policies, infrastructure investments and limited interference in energy markets  —   appear to tell a different story. ”  She reiterated several of her points with host Marlow today. “Conservatives and Republicans are not   ” said Hastings. “I think the Trump administration now has the opportunity as the original party of the environment to   that issue,” she added. Her broader point was that the Right is as invested in preserving the environment as the Left but simply opts for a different path to achieve that shared goal.
