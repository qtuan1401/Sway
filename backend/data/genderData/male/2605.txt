(Want to get this briefing by email? Here’s the  .) Good evening. Here’s the latest. 1. In the days before he died on Thursday, Prince was spotted riding his bike, hosting a party and visiting a record store. But there were hints of health troubles in recent weeks. Mourning continued Friday for a   musician, sex symbol and style icon who took high heels to new heights. A cause of death has not yet been identified. _____ 2. Virginia’s Democratic governor is restoring the voting rights of 200, 000 convicted felons, reversing a Civil   law he said was intended to disenfranchise  . Terry McAuliffe circumvented the swing state’s   Legislature, a move likely to provoke a G. O. P. backlash. Though most of the felons are   a core Democratic constituency, their electoral effect is likely to be modest. _____ 3. Donald J. Trump has been more accepting of sexual minorities than his rivals for the G. O. P. nomination. “If two people dig each other, they dig each other,” he wrote in 2005 to congratulate Elton John on his marriage. Meanwhile, his new campaign chief told Republican leaders that Mr. Trump knew he needed to reshape his image, and suggested that the candidate’s bombastic style has largely been an act. _____ 4. While the Museum of Modern Art is expanding, with the help of a $100 million donation from the California billionaire David Geffen, the Metropolitan Museum of Art is in peril. The institutions’ diverging circumstances speak to the booming audience for Modern and contemporary art, and the Met’s struggle to keep up with it. The Met is facing deficits and possible staff cuts, and development of a new wing is stalled. _____ 5. President Obama and the first lady, Michelle Obama, dined with Queen Elizabeth II and her husband, Prince Philip, in London. The lunch kicked off a   British visit for President Obama, during which he is encouraging British people to vote against leaving the European Union. London’s mayor, Boris Johnson, published a provocative essay alluding to views that Mr. Obama is motivated by a radical   agenda. _____ 6. An international group of experts investigating the disappearance of 43 students in 2014 described running into harassment, stonewalling and intimidation. Far from uncovering the answers the Mexican authorities promised, the investigators said a lack of government cooperation had left them unable to solve the case. _____ 7. Welcome back to Westeros. HBO’s “Game of Thrones” returns for its sixth season on Sunday, leaving its legions of fans straining to remember where the show left off in June. Catch up on where 11 main characters were last seen. We’re sorry to say we know nothing about the status of Jon Snow. _____ 8. The suicide rate in the U. S. is at its highest level in nearly 30 years, with women and   Americans hit especially hard, federal data analysis found. The overall rate rose by 24 percent from 1999 to 2014, increasing to 13 deaths per 100, 000 people. “It’s really stunning to see such a large increase in suicide rates affecting virtually every age group,” a health care adviser said. _____ 9. Republicans have gotten what they seemed to want: a depleted, defanged Internal Revenue Service. The target of   sentiments that in recent years have grown in intensity, the I. R. S. is fighting back, arguing that budget cuts have forced the agency to collect less money and pursue fewer fraudsters. “You really shouldn’t be able to reduce the amount you spend on I. R. S. decrease their performance ability and then complain about their performance,” an analyst said. _____ 10. Finally, some bad news if you’re a single woman in China. That handsome, exotic foreigner who wants to take you out on a date might actually be a spy, Chinese officials are warning. Though a   cartoon was posted in subway stations, streets and living areas, residents seemed unconvinced they were being used for state secrets.
