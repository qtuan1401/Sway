HBO has ordered two new projects from Fusion, including a   special about the spread of intolerance in America hosted by Univision anchor Jorge Ramos. [According to Variety, the pay cabler has ordered 10 episodes of the   documentary series Outpost, which will examine various cultural aspects of Latin American countries. The series is described as “offering authentic local perspectives on cultural idiosyncrasies, subcultures, environmental matters and adventure sports. ”  HBO has also licensed the   special Hate in America with Jorge Ramos, which will examine the state of hate in America, “from white separatists to   activists, investigating why hatred seems to be growing and who is feeding it. ” Both projects were developed under Univision Story House, the network’s   original content development shingle that creates programming both for its own platforms like Fusion and for other networks, according to Deadline. Fusion  —   the   digital and cable news outlet   by ABC and Univision  —   launched in 2013 with an emphasis on millennial viewers. Reports surfaced in December that ABC was looking to sell its stake in Fusion to Univision as the outlet has struggled to gain traction. Ramos has been an anchor at Univision since 1986, and also hosts a Sunday program on the network called Al Punto (To the Point). The    newsman is also host of the Fusion show America with Jorge Ramos. Ramos has been an outspoken advocate for illegal immigration. In August, the Univision anchor was escorted out of an Iowa press conference held by GOP presidential frontrunner Donald Trump for repeatedly interrupting the candidate and speaking out of turn. Time Warner CEO Jeff Bewkes announced Tuesday that HBO would up its original programming hours to 600 this year, an increase of 50 percent, as the premium network fends off competition from streaming service competitors Amazon and Netflix.
