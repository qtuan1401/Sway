(Want to get this briefing by email? Here’s the  .) Good evening. Here’s the latest. 1. Presidential candidates mostly concentrated on New York a day before the state’s primary. Donald J. Trump is well ahead in polls there, and Hillary Clinton has a smaller edge. Mrs. Clinton campaigned in Manhattan and Bernie Sanders in Queens. On the Republican side, Mr. Trump and John Kasich focused their attention upstate. But Ted Cruz chose to avoid New Yorkers (and their values). He campaigned in Maryland and Pennsylvania. _____ 2. On Sunday night, Brazil  responded to the impeachment of President Dilma Rousseff as if it were a party one lawmaker fired a confetti gun, and in cities across the nation, thousands took to the streets to celebrate. Monday brought a more sobering appraisal, as the country’s political and economic crises remain as vexing as ever. The Senate will now vote on whether to try Ms. Rousseff on charges of using money from   banks to hide a budget deficit. _____ 3. The Supreme Court appeared sharply divided over a challenge to President Obama’s plan to allow millions of undocumented immigrants to stay in the country. Though the case may result in a significant ruling on presidential power and immigration policy, much of the argument was highly technical. Even so, two of the justices took time to acknowledge the ruling’s implications, including Sonia Sotomayor, who nodded to the millions of immigrants who live “in the shadows. ” _____ 4. The death toll from the earthquake that hit Ecuador on Saturday night rose to 350 as residents and rescue crews continued to unearth victims. More than 2, 000 people were injured by the  .8 quake, the strongest to hit the country in decades. “It’s incredible what has happened to us  —   that our city is destroyed and we’re experiencing such anguish and pain,” one resident said. _____ 5. Last month, the elite Phillips Exeter Academy disclosed that it had removed a teacher in 2011 over sexual misconduct in the 1970s and ’80s. The announcement shook loose allegations against other employees, and a second teacher was fired Wednesday. Exeter is the latest in a string of American prep schools that have been rocked by similar accusations, and experts say the publicity has started to yield changes. Schools are   their methods for preventing sexual abuse and are becoming more receptive to students who report it. _____ 6. A federal appeals court affirmed a legal settlement between the N. F. L. and the potentially thousands of retired players who were injured during their careers by repeated hits to the head. Some players objected to the deal, originally struck in 2013 and amended in 2014, believing the settlement of up to $5 million per player was not adequate. But the court said that those criticisms “risk making the perfect the enemy of the good. ” _____ 7. Houston woke up to find its lower areas underwater Monday after thunderstorms drenched the city with as much as two feet of rain. Schools and colleges closed across southeastern Texas, traffic was paralyzed by the flooding and about 110, 000 customers were left without power. _____ 8. A European court ruling has made Google the final authority on individual Europeans’ requests that web pages referring to them be removed from its searches. More than 417, 000 people have asked that Google “forget” them, but the company, working behind closed doors, has approved fewer than half of those requests, leaving critics dissatisfied. “It’s a   solution,” one said. _____ 9. A nonprofit group in Washington State has come up with a novel solution to a shortage of affordable housing: hoisting unwanted houses from Canada onto barges and transporting them to where they are needed in the state. The idea, while unusual, has proved to be less expensive than building new houses. _____ 10. The recipients of this year’s batch of Pulitzer Prizes were announced on Monday. The Associated Press won the award for public service for a series on slavery in the Southeast Asia fishing trade. Broadway’s “Hamilton” picked up the prize for drama. And The Times won prizes for international reporting and breaking news photography, including the above picture. _____ 11. On Sunday night, HBO dusted its hands of the fifth season of “Girls,” running two episodes, including the season finale,   . Our critic writes that the sudden disposal points to the “national indifference that’s accrued” around the show, as well as a heap of   offerings coming from the network. But he also praises “Girls” for remaining ambitious, writing that it’s “never stopped looking for the grander, harsher psychological picture. ” _____ 12. What is a dog? A new book argues that the loving, lovable creatures that many of us consider our best animal friends are not perfectly representative of the species. An estimated   of the dogs on Earth are not pets, instead living their lives as   or undomesticated scavengers. The book’s authors argue that those dogs hold the key to canine nature. _____ Your Evening Briefing is posted at 6 p. m. Eastern. And don’t miss Your Morning Briefing, posted weekdays at 6 a. m.
