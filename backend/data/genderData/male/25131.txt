Fifty Wisconsin faith leaders joined Governor Scott Walker in endorsing Sen. Ted Cruz for president this week. [The news comes as Cruz surged in polling this week and frontrunner Donald Trump hit some new controversy on the campaign trail. A Marquette Law School poll released Wednesday showed that Cruz jumped 21 points from 19 percent in February to 40 in the March poll, while Trump held steady at 30 percent of likely Republican voters in Wisconsin.  Cruz also made a trip to California this week to appear on the   show Jimmy Kimmel Live! hold a   fundraiser, and meet with the lion’s share of more than 100 Californians slated as delegates for Cruz. In the days leading up to the March 15 Missouri and Florida primary contests, Cruz picked up endorsements from over 100 faith leaders. While Cruz and frontrunner Donald Trump came out    in Missouri, Trump took a resounding win in Florida over   competitor Sen. Marco Rubio, with Cruz in third. On Saturday, Cruz will host a screening of God’s Not Dead 2 in Green Bay. “Everything Ted Cruz says he would do, he has done. He fears God, and he understands the fact that this country was founded through the inspiration of the Word of God,” said Kabeer   a former Green Bay Packers defensive, now serving as a deacon at Living Hope Church in Green Bay.
