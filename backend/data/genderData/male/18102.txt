Friday in Altoona, PA, Republican presidential nominee Donald Trump said the only way he will lose this November in Pennsylvania is “if cheating goes on. ”  Trump said, “The only way we can lose, in my opinion, I really mean this, Pennsylvania, is if cheating goes on. I really believe it. ” He added, “That’s the way we could lose the state. We have to call up law enforcement, and we have to have the sheriffs and the police chiefs, everybody watching, because if we get cheated out of this election,  if we get cheated out of a win in Pennsylvania, which is such a vital state  —   especially when I know what’s happening here folks. She can’t beat what’s happening here. The only way they can beat it, in my opinion, and I mean this 100 percent, is if in certain sections of the state, they cheat. ” (  The Hill) Follow Pam Key On Twitter @pamkeyNEN
