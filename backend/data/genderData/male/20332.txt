Bizarre. That’s the only word to describe how “in the bag” NBC News is for Hillary Clinton. You’d almost think she owns them. You’d almost think she’s blackmailing or bribing them. She must have photos of the head of the NBC News division and anchorman Lester Holt in bed with someone very shocking. It’s that bad.  Can you even imagine if Donald Trump served in a presidential cabinet and sold out his access and government contracts in return for donations to his foundation? It would be the biggest news story in America. The FBI would be leading him away in handcuffs right now.
