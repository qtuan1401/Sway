Veteran pollster and political analyst Pat Caddell joined Breitbart News Daily SiriusXM host Alex Marlow Wednesday to discuss the state of the Presidential race. “Hillary Clinton is in real trouble,” said Caddell. [“If anything is a sign of desperation, it’s ‘let’s divert the attention. Let’s move it off our problems and try to create problems here’,” he continued. “For her   …     to say that the Russians are trying to interfere to get Donald Trump elected is laughable. But it is a sign of some desperation that they have no message. ”  Added Caddell, “Hillary Clinton had assumed that she could go away and hide and the camapign would be over and she would win. And what they’re coming to conflict with, they have no message. They have nothing to say to people. ” Breitbart News Daily airs on SiriusXM Patriot 125 weekdays from 6:00 a. m. to 9:00 a. m. Eastern.
