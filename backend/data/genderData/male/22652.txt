Investigators say he made a 911 phone call during the attack in which he said he was avenging the bombings of Muslims in the Middle East and referenced the 2013 Boston Marathon bombings. But if there is a clear link between the attack in Orlando and the Islamic State, it would be the most   incident yet in the group’s wider, relentless campaign against gays. Ever since the group came to prominence amid security vacuums in Iraq and Syria, it has set about persecuting religious minorities, women and others whose identity and lifestyle are anathema to its puritanical creed. In areas under the control of the Islamic State, its fighters have issued edicts against homosexual behavior and flashy hairstyles and promised death for anyone caught in the act of sodomy. Across the Middle East, the LGBT community faces varying degrees of repression, both because of laws directed against its members and the wider social stigma. But under the Islamic State, things took a devastating turn. 2:08 PM  —   . @HillaryClinton stops for some pics after the rally pic. twitter.   —   fox8news (@fox8news) June 13, 2016,  2:05 PM  —   Spirit of  ?

He also sent Gilroy 13 to 15 phone messages a day, he said. “I quit because everything he said was toxic,” Gilroy said Sunday, “and the company wouldn’t do anything. This guy was unhinged and unstable. He talked of killing people. ” Gilroy said this shooting didn’t come as a surprise to him. 10:45 AM  —   Trump also cancels fundraisers.
