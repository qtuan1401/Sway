Presumptive Republican nominee and real estate billionaire Donald Trump declared Thursday that the GOP will become the party of the working class, a remarkable stance in an era of mass Third World immigration encouraged by international corporations seeking to boost profits.  “Five, ten years from now  —   different party. You’re going to have a worker’s party,” Trump told Bloomberg News. “A party of people that haven’t had a real wage increase in 18 years, that are angry. ” “What I want to do, I think cutting Social Security is a big mistake for the Republican Party. And I know it’s a big part of the budget. Cutting it the wrong way is a big mistake, and even cutting it [at all],” Trump said. The billionaire businessman said that while he was unaware of the   Gang of Eight deal and subsequent immigration bills, which would triple immigration from the Third World to satisfy business interests, he backed border security: “When I made my speech at Trump Tower, the June 16 speech, I didn’t know about the Gang of Eight  …     I just knew instinctively that our borders are a mess. ”
