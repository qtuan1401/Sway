Gay hook up smartphone apps Tinder and Grindr are reporting a massive spike in usage in the Philadelphia area as the Democrats gather for their national nominating convention. [According to analysis by the gay   app company Grindr, usage has climbed 148 percent in Philly thus far during this DNC Convention week with most of the increase emanating from the area around the Wells Fargo Center where the convention is being held.  Further, 57 percent of those logging onto the service were not users from the city but are users from elsewhere. This leads app administrators to conclude the users are from out of town and are in the city for the convention. “Looking at comparable bubbles around the country —  Times Square, Disney Land, Trump Tower in Las Vegas —  we don’t see an increase that even approaches these levels,” a Grindr data analyst told The Daily Mail. Tinder found similar results with a 54 percent rise in usage as the convention grinds on. The Mail also reported that among thousands of the “raunchy messages” exchanged over the two gay   apps there were “29 mentions of the DNC —  but just three uses of the word Hillary. ” Follow Warner Todd Huston on Twitter @warnerthuston or email the author at igcolonel@hotmail. com.
