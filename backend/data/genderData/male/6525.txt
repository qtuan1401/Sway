(Want to get this briefing by email? Here’s the  .) Good evening. Here’s the latest. 1. Definitive wins in New York on Tuesday send Hillary Clinton and Donald J. Trump into next week’s primary contests with the wind in their sails. Voters in Connecticut, Delaware, Maryland, Rhode Island and Pennsylvania will head to the polls on Tuesday. _____ 2. Shortly after casting a ballot for himself on Tuesday, Mr. Trump sat down with Times journalists for a lengthy interview, presenting a softer and seemingly humbler side. Regarding the past year, he said: “My life is winning. I win. I know how to win. Most people don’t know how to win. In golf, in sports, in life  —   I win, always. Better knock on wood. ” And then he did. He knocked on his desk. _____ 3. American money is getting a makeover. Harriet Tubman, an   who ferried thousands of slaves to freedom, will replace the slaveholding Andrew Jackson on the center of a new $20 note. And while a woman was also expected to front the $10 bill, the rap musical “Hamilton” seems to have protected Alexander Hamilton’s place on it. Women will be represented on the back instead, and on the back of the $5 bill. _____ 4. As many as 500 people may have died when a boat carrying migrants capsized in the Mediterranean last week, the United Nations refugee agency said after interviews with 41 survivors. That would constitute the worst humanitarian calamity in Europe’s migrant crisis since last April, when more than 800 people died off the coast of Libya. _____ 5. The first criminal charges over lead contamination in Flint’s water were filed against three government employees in Michigan. Two of them, state officials, are accused of misleading the federal Environmental Protection Agency about how the city was treating lead levels after switching its water supply to save money. Above is Michael Glasgow, the city’s utilities manager, who faces a mix of felony and misdemeanor charges. _____ 6. Five former police officers involved in the shooting deaths of two unarmed people after Hurricane Katrina pleaded guilty in federal court, ending a wrenching   saga that shocked and sickened people long before Ferguson and Baltimore became bywords in national debates on the use of force by the police. They each received significantly less prison time than they originally faced. _____ 7. President Obama arrived in Saudi Arabia barely a day after publicly supporting the release of documents that could implicate Saudi officials in the attacks of Sept. 11, 2001, but administration officials said that wasn’t mentioned during his meeting with King Salman. The two leaders met amid deepening tensions over delicate issues like the Iran nuclear deal and the fight against terrorism. _____ 8. It’s been two years since the militant group Boko Haram abducted 276 Nigerian schoolgirls, and while U. S. officials say they have located clusters of the hostages, rescue operations have not been carried out. Fear of putting the captives at risk or inciting retaliation against hostages in other areas is holding up the efforts, but officials insist that plans to free the girls have not been abandoned. _____ 9. Surprise! College applications aren’t getting less stressful. With the admissions season just about wrapped up, many colleges are saying it was their most selective year yet. The heightened competition, or at least the perception of it, is driving students to apply to more institutions. But all the anxiety may be an overreaction: The average acceptance rate has remained stable. _____ 10. Happy Birthday to Queen Elizabeth II, who turns 90 years old on Thursday. In Britain, the bars (excuse us, pubs) will be open longer, and celebrations will extend beyond this week. But the Indian government wants something back from the British royal family: a 105.  diamond that some say was a gift and others say was stolen. Above, the coronation of Queen Elizabeth II in 1953. _____ 11. The market for meteorites is tough right now. Several space rocks  —   including one that kind of looks like a piece of pizza, above  —   were up for auction on Wednesday, but many didn’t sell. Perhaps the prices were a bit out of this world. _____ 12. Lastly, go wash your hands. Differently. A recent study of two techniques  —   a simple,   method recommended by the C. D. C. versus a more complicated method recommended by the World Health Organization  —   found the more complicated one to be better. And both methods involved sanitizer, not soap. _____ Your Evening Briefing is posted at 6 p. m. Eastern. And don’t miss Your Morning Briefing, posted weekdays at 6 a. m.
