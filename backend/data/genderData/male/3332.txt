(Want to get this briefing by email? Here’s the  .) Good evening. Here’s the latest. 1. The official theme for the first day of the Republican National Convention was “Make America Safe Again,” but infighting and protests were undercurrents. Tonight’s   speakers included Rudolph Giuliani, the former New York mayor, and Donald Trump’s wife, Melania. Mr. Trump introduced her, walking on stage to Queen’s “We Are the Champions” and telling the crowd: “Oh we’re gonna win, we’re gonna win so big. ” Our live coverage is here. The New Yorker published an article in which Mr. Trump’s ghostwriter on “The Art of the Deal” confesses to “a deep sense of remorse” for portraying Mr. Trump positively. “Lying is second nature to him,” the author said. _____ 2. Louisiana officials detailed how an     killed three police officers and wounded three more in Baton Rouge, saying he deliberately targeted them. In a range of digital postings, sometimes under another name, the gunman complained that “devils” ran the world and advocated a bloody response to recent fatal shootings by the police. “One hundred percent of revolutions, of victims fighting their oppressors,” he said in one clip, “have been successful through fighting back, through bloodshed. ” _____ 3. Hillary Clinton, speaking at an N. A. A. C. P. convention in Cincinnati, denounced the attacks on police officers in Baton Rouge and Dallas, as well as police shootings that killed two black men this month. “This madness has to stop,” she said. An analysis of dozens of recent state and national polls of voters shows that Mrs. Clinton holds a modest but clear lead over Mr. Trump. _____ 4. Leading antidoping officials urged that Russia be barred from the Summer Olympics in Rio after an independent inquiry confirmed a Russian  ’s claims of   doping. The Russian president, Vladimir Putin, said officials implicated in the report would be “temporarily suspended,” but criticized “a dangerous relapse of politics intruding into sports. ” The International Olympic Committee called an emergency meeting for Tuesday. _____ 5. One of our   stories today is a meditation on clutter from a different perspective: someone who simply couldn’t afford much stuff. A woman remembers the years when poverty mandated a “minimalist” lifestyle so popular now among the middle class. “For people who are not so well off,” she notes, “the idea of opting to have even less is not really an option. ” _____ 6. Facing reports that Roger Ailes would soon be removed as chairman of Fox News, 21st Century Fox insisted that “this matter is not yet resolved. ” Mr. Ailes is being sued for sexual harassment by a former anchor, Gretchen Carlson. _____ 7. Turkey’s government fired nearly 9, 000 police officers, widening its vast purge of perceived opponents after a failed military coup. Above, a funeral for a police officer killed in clashes. Over the weekend, 6, 000 military personnel were arrested and 3, 000 judges suspended. Secretary of State John Kerry and the European Union’s top diplomat urged President Recep Tayyip Erdogan to show restraint, even suggesting Turkey’s membership in NATO and candidacy for the E. U. could be compromised. _____ 8. Political tensions in France are spiking, as   opposition politicians assailed the Socialist government over Thursday’s terrorist attack in Nice. Jeers and calls for the French prime minister to resign fractured a moment of silence he attended in Nice, called to honor the 84 people killed there by a rampaging truck driver. Above, the gathering. New details emerged about the attacker: he was not an observant Muslim but had been recently searching for Islamist material and had collected images of Islamic State and other terrorist figures. _____ 9. A celebrity feud flared anew. Kanye West’s wife, Kim Kardashian West, posted clips of a phone conversation that appeared to counter Taylor Swift’s insistence that she was blindsided by lyrics in one of Mr. West’s songs. In the clips, Ms. Swift thanks him for running the line “I feel like me and Taylor might still have sex” by her, and he responds, “Relationships are more important than punch lines. ” _____ 10. Finally, stocked up on tissues? Our medical expert wants you to know that the summer cold is no anomaly. We tend to think of colds as being more contagious in winter, he says, possibly because the rhinovirus is more prevalent then and spreads easily when people congregate indoors. But the science, he says, shows that cold temperatures by themselves don’t increase vulnerability. Above, a reminder of subfreezing temperatures. _____ Your Evening Briefing is posted at 6 p. m.
