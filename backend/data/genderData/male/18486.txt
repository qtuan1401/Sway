GOP frontrunner Donald Trump, who is boycotting the Fox News GOP debate tonight, says two candidates have called and want to attend the event for veterans that Trump is holding instead. [Trump posted on Twitter:  Wow, two candidates called last night and said they want to go to my event tonight at Drake University.  —   Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) January 28, 2016,  Trump added: The “debate” tonight will be a total disaster  —   low ratings with advertisers and advertising rates dropping like a rock. I hate to see this.  —   Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) January 28, 2016,  Trump decided to not attend the GOP primary debate hosted by Fox News after the network wouldn’t remove Megyn Kelly as a debate moderator. Trump said Kelly has been unfair to him in a past debate. Trump also said a “wise guy” press release from Fox News also made him decide to boycott the debate and hold a fundraising event for veterans instead.
