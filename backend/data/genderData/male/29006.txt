Sunday on CNN’s “State of the Union,” presumptive Democratic presidential nominee Hillary Clinton supporter Sen. Cory Booker ( ) said presumptive Republican presidential nominee Donald Trump was a “dangerous man” who would “put this planet in peril” if he was elected president.  Booker said, “I am telling you right now, I don’t care who Donald Trump picks, this is somebody that’s a danger, not only to our country but his recklessness, his disregard, demeaning and degrading of other individuals, will put this planet in peril. This is a dangerous man. I have heard what’s come out of his mouth. It’s frankly frightening about what could happen if he was the    of this country and had his finger  —   had the codes to the nuclear weapons. ” Follow Pam Key on Twitter @pamkeyNEN
