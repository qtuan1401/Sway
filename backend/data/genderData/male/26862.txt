GOP presidential frontrunner Donald Trump is highlighting how many illegal immigrants with criminal records are at large in the United States. [“We have right now 179, 000 illegal immigrants who are criminals, who have criminal convictions,” Trump said in a speech to an overflow crowd at Pat  Robertson’s Regent University in Virginia Beach, Virginia.  “That means  —   think about that, that’s like filling up Yankee Stadium four times,” he said. “We have all over the country. These are criminals. These are people who were convicted of a crime. ” Trump has made fighting illegal immigration a central tenet of his campaign for the presidency, reiterating the importance of borders and an orderly immigration process at practically every campaign event. “We have to have borders,” Trump said again Wednesday. “We have to have strong borders. If we don’t have borders we don’t have a country. And people can come into our country but they have to come in legally. They can’t do what they’re doing. ” According to the New York Yankees, their stadium can seat 50, 287 people.
