’  ’ ’   CNN has been   Republican presidential nominee Donald   Trump in real time in its television chyrons, and when Trump made   news on Thursday by saying that President Barack Obama founded   ISIS, the network corrected him. ’ ”   But the correction itself wasn’t exactly accurate. ” ’   In its   CNN said that Abu Bakr   founded the   terrorist group. But while he’’s the ”caliph,” or leader, of ISIS,   Abu Musab   is the bloodthirsty zealot who’’s . ’ ’   ISIS was born out of Al Qaeda in Iraq, a group that rose up after   the US invasion of that country. AQI quickly gained a reputation   for being even more indiscriminately violent than its parent   organization, and Zarqawi is the man responsible for that vision. ’ ”   Al Qaeda’s central leadership eventually disowned its Iraqi   affiliate after Zarqawi defied orders and continued   sanctioning the killing of Muslims in Iraq. He declared the   creation of an Islamic State in 2006 before he was killed in a US   airstrike. ”
