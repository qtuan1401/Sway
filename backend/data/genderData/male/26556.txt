Failed 2012 presidential candidate Mitt Romney admits he wasn’t surprised that he utterly failed to stop Donald Trump from getting the Republican nomination for president. [In an interview with the Wall Street Journal, Romney explains that his friends and advisers warned him not to tackle Trump in his #NeverTrump speech, but did it anyway because of his conscience.  He says his conscience was sparked by his son Josh Romney, who asked him, “When the grandkids ask ‘What did you do to stop Donald Trump?’ what are you going to say? ’” That’s when Romney says he decided to act, putting himself squarely in the path of the force that was fueling Trump’s rise to power. But Romney appeared satisfied with his actions, explaining that he could sleep at night knowing that he did something to stand up for his values. “I know that some people are offended that someone who lost and is the former nominee continues to speak, but that’s how I can sleep at night,” Romney said to the Journal. “And there are some people, though it’s a small number, who still value my opinion. ”
