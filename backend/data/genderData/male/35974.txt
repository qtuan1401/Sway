Washington (CNN) Hillary Clinton is heading to Atlantic City, New Jersey, the site of some of Donald Trump’s most   business dealings    and setbacks    to hit the presumptive Republican nominee over his business past. Clinton will appear in the city on Wednesday to talk about Trump’s temperament, a Clinton campaign official said. The presumptive Democratic nominee will discuss Trump’s business record in the gambling mecca, including controversial casino bankruptcies. The campaign official said the trip will ”highlight Trump’s now familiar pattern: Trump restructured his debts, padding his own pockets, while investors, contractors, and working people bore the brunt.” Clinton has previously attacked Trump’s business record, most vividly in Detroit in late May. ”He could bankrupt America like he has bankrupted his companies,” Clinton said then. ”I mean ask yourself, how could anybody lose money running a casino? Really?” Trump has defended using bankruptcy laws to help his businesses and employees, as he is legally allowed to do. And he noted that he himself has personally never gone bankrupt. Trump filed for bankruptcy on the Taj Mahal in 1991 and the Trump Castle Associates in 1992. He later filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy on Trump Hotel  Casino Resorts in 2004 and Trump Entertainment Resorts in 2009. Clinton is expected to solidly beat Trump in New Jersey, though Clinton may see some spillover from her Jersey jaunt in Pennsylvania, which polls have shown to be a tight race.
