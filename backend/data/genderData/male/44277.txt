’  ’ ’   Chinese President Xi Jinping will meet with US President Donald   Trump in Florida on . It is arguably the most highly anticipated meeting   in global economics. ’ ’   The two men, as leaders of the first and second largest economies   in the world, literally have the fate of the entire global   economy in their hands. ’ ”   And they couldn’t be any more different.    From his first moments on the campaign trail, Trump has   bellicosely accused China of being a currency manipulator (not   true) and said that trade between the US and China has been   unfairly tilted in China’s favor. ” ’   Then, before his inauguration Trump made a massive misstep of   speaking with the President of Taiwan, tacitly recognizing it as   a sovereign nation and violating the   policy the US has   held since the 1970s. ’ ”   Xi Jinping, on the other hand, is a man of few words or   expressions. While  its dislike of Trump’s   China bullying, Xi himself has said little of Trump’s   administration. After Trump called Taiwan,  ” ’  ’ ’  ’ ’   ’ ’  ’ ’  ’ ’  ’ ’  ’ ’  ’ ’   Things could get bad if talks break down on economic issues.   Navarro, who Cohn has dismissed as a neophyte but Trump genuinely   seems to like, has insisted on labeling China a ”currency   manipulator.”  ’ ’  ’ ’  ’ ’  ’ ’  ’ ’  ’ ’  ’ ’  ’ ’  ’ ’  ’ ’  ’ ’  ’ ”   In other words, the White House thinks it has done enough. Xi,   however, may not be satisfied.    It sounds like he is going to want more reassurance from Trump on   Taiwan. If the administration shows any resistance to that,   there’s going to be a problem. A really, big problem. A really,   bad problem. ” ’Chinese President Xi Jinping will meet with US. ..’ ’’ ’’ ’’
