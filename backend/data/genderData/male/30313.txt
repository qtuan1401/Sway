Oculus Rift creator and tech entrepreneur Palmer Luckey has been revealed to be funding the   Trump organization Nimble America, which is dedicated to spreading Trump’s message on the internet through   Clinton memes and “shitposting. ”[   Luckey is worth an estimated $700 million after he sold his company Oculus to Facebook in 2014 for $2 billion, and his identity as the vice president of Nimble America has only just been revealed after he used a pseudonym to promote the organization on Reddit.  “We believe that America has been lead by poor leaders who have abandoned American principles and sold out all Americans,” announced Nimble America in a post on Reddit last week. “With the right leadership America will reverse its course towards mediocrity and globalism, becoming great again. ” “We’ve proven that shitposting is powerful and meme magic is real,” they continued. “So many of you have asked us, how we can bring this to real life. We wanted to do it in a way that was transparent and had purpose. Not just sell   to sell them, but to sell   to shitpost. ” “It’s something that no campaign is going to run,” said Luckey to the Daily Beast on the subject of billboards they are planning. “I’ve got plenty of money  …     Money is not my issue. I thought it sounded like a real jolly good time. ” The organization has already spent nearly $10, 000 on billboards,  and “website ops,” and a billboard is already being planned outside the venue of the first presidential debate. Luckey is the latest tech entrepreneur to come out in support of Donald Trump, after PayPal   Peter Thiel endorsed the Republican presidential candidate at the party’s national convention in July. Thiel was also revealed to be funding Hulk Hogan’s lawsuit against Gawker, which ended up leaving both the company and its founder Nick Denton bankrupt in August.
