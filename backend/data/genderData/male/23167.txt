While admitting that Donald Trump did “mediocre” and Hillary Clinton “had an edge” at Monday night’s presidential debate, Democratic pollster Pat Caddell told Breitbart News Daily SiriusXM host Alex Marlow Tuesday, “What was interesting is Trump really helped himself. ”[Caddell was referring to a detailed   poll also featured by Breitbart News. “First of all,   percent of the people who watched the debate and we had   of almost 900 interviews, said they didn’t change their minds. Of the small number of people who did, Trump ended up with a slight advantage among undecideds to him. But more importantly,” continued Caddell, “and this is what does matter   in debates, is how you deal with the challenges and impressions you have. ”  Caddell said based on the polling, Trump “actually topped Hillary Clinton” on who was seen as plausible as president. “That was his great test,” said Caddell, “that he stand there and be seen most of all as plausible as president. He was preferred over her by four points. ” Caddell acknowledged that Clinton won on “issues” however, Trump won on both who was seen as a strong leader “by four or five points,” and “on who was most honest, he won that 49  —   42, by seven points. ” Trump also beat Clinton by four points on the question of who cares about people like me, according to Caddell. There’s more on the poll available here: Pat Caddell, the Democratic pollster and Fox News insider, told Breitbart News that poll respondents said Clinton performed better at the debate 48 percent said Clinton did a better job, compared to 43 percent, who said Trump did the better job. “However, 95 percent of the people we contacted told us they were not going to change their vote based on the debate,” Caddell said.
