Bloomberg Politics also asked GOP voters who they would like to be the face of the Republican Party if Hillary Clinton wins the 2016 election. Indiana Gov. Mike Pence  —   Trump’s running mate  —   ranked number one with 27 percent. Trump came in second with 24 percent and Paul Ryan came in fourth behind Sen. Ted Cruz ( ) with 15 percent.
