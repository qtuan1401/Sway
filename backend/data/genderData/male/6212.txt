Updated, 10:48 a. m. Good morning on this perfect fall Friday. Is there any clash of ideas as “monumental” as the one over our city’s skyline? For every spike, steeple and spire, there are wastebaskets full of dashed architectural ambitions. These unbuilt projects often tell us as much about our city’s history and values as the built environment, says Sam Lubell,   with Greg Goldin of “Never Built New York. ” Take I. M. Pei’s Hyperboloid, a sleek hourglass office tower and transit hub proposed in the 1950s, which would have entailed the demolition of Grand Central Terminal. Even as the rest of America took to the road in cars, and struggling railroads were liquidating assets, our city preserved the   building in Midtown. (Sorry about that, Mr. Pei, but we’re glad it didn’t pan out.) Or imagine floating in a translucent bubble to Governors Island on a gondola designed by Santiago Calatrava. Sounds nice, but in 2006 The Times’s architecture critic argued that the plan ran up against one of New York’s hottest commodities: a spectacular view. And then there was Trump City. Donald J. Trump’s plan for a grandiose, 14.        on the West Side would have included office buildings, 7, 600 apartments, a huge shopping mall and the world’s tallest building. But its magnitude aroused staunch opposition in the neighborhood, sparking what Mr. Trump described as “a war to the death. ” Trump City was eventually downgraded to what is now known as Trump Place  —   where, earlier this week, the owner of three buildings removed the  ’s name from their façades. Occasionally, though, adventurous architecture does get built here. Test your knowledge of New York’s new skyline with this quiz: Can you identify some of our most iconic modern structures by their silhouettes? Here’s what else is happening: Mirror, mirror, on the wall, which day is the fairest of them all? Today. Sunshine. Blue skies.  . Enough said.
