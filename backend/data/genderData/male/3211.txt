(Want to get this briefing by email? Here’s the  .) Good evening. Here’s the latest. 1. Minnesota’s governor called for a federal investigation into the police shooting of a black man, Philando Castile, during a traffic stop. Mr. Castile’s girlfriend, above, streamed the aftermath live on Facebook, immersing viewers in the grisly scene, below. It has been replayed more than four million times. With a composure periodically fractured by wailing, she described an officer shooting at least four times after Mr. Castile began complying with a request to produce his registration  —   and alerted the officer that he had a licensed gun. An emotional President Obama said “all Americans should be troubled” by the shootings caught on video this week in Minnesota and Louisiana. _____ 2. A House panel questioned the F. B. I. director, James Comey, for nearly four hours about the bureau’s decision not to recommend criminal charges against Hillary Clinton. Under strong Republican pressure, Mr. Comey reiterated that while Mrs. Clinton’s use of a personal email network as secretary of state showed “great carelessness,” it did not meet the bar for criminality. But he also said a series of her statements were untrue. Those included her assertions that none of the emails were marked classified and that she had turned over all   emails. _____ 3. Donald Trump held a series of meetings with congressional Republicans that turned rocky. A spokesman for Senator Ben Sasse of Nebraska said the meeting had not persuaded him to endorse Mr. Trump, calling the election “a Dumpster fire. ” Mr. Trump also raised a new wave of anxiety about his motives and temperament, hedging when asked about speculation that he might win the presidency but decline to serve. “I’ll let you know how I feel about it after it happens,” he told our reporter. _____ 4. Democrats are seeking to leverage Mr. Trump’s unpopularity among broad sectors of voters in other November elections. They plan to spend $1 million on ads painting the Republican Party as one with Mr. Trump. And several Democrats said Bernie Sanders would endorse Mrs. Clinton next week. _____ 5. Good news for the   : Researchers found that riding an electric bike  —   one that supplements rather than replaces the rider’s effort  —   can still provide a workout comparable to brisk walking or an easy jog. And the 20 subjects reported that their rides were “a blast,” the study’s lead author said. _____ 6. Germany took a significant step on women’s rights. German lawmakers unanimously passed a law that makes it easier to prosecute violence against women. It defines rape as a violation of a woman’s will, affirming that “no means no. ” The measure includes a provision for abuses in crowds, which was added after reports of widespread sexual assault in Cologne on New Year’s Eve. Above, a protest over those assaults in January. _____ 7. One of our   stories today is an essay by a former hedge fund trader on the damage done by pervasive, sexist “bro talk” in the financial world.   comments about women’s bodies and sexual appeal, he writes, produce “a force field of disrespect and exclusion that makes it incredibly difficult for women to ascend the Wall Street ladder. ” _____ 8. Opening this weekend: “The Secret Life of Pets,” an animated,   frolic voiced by the likes of Louis C. K. Hannibal Buress, Jenny Slate, Kevin Hart and Ellie Kemper. Our reviewer writes, “While this movie never achieves  —   and does not really aim for  —   the emotional richness or visual inventiveness of the better Pixar features, or the sly social consciousness of ‘Zootopia,’ it has a playful absurdity and a winning, friendly spirit. ” _____ 9. “The lake was our mother and our father. Without this lake, where do we go?” Our special report on the evaporation of Bolivia’s   lake, Poopó, tracks the plight of indigenous people robbed of their way of life by climate change. The lake, after suffering decades of water diversions and El Niño droughts, basically disappeared in December, making climate refugees of those who once lived by its waters. _____ 10. President Obama left for Poland, where he will attend his final NATO summit meeting. The agenda promises to be crammed, given the need to address Russia’s provocative policies in Eastern Europe, the Continent’s migrant crisis, fears of more terrorism and, not least, the disruption of Britain’s vote to exit the European Union. _____ Your Evening Briefing is posted at 6 p. m.
