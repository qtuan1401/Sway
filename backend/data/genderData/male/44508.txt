’  ’ ’   President Donald Trump raised more than a few eyebrows during his   first visit as president to Walter Reed National Medical Center   on Saturday when he awarded the Purple Heart to Army Sergeant   First Class Alvaro Barrientos. ’ ’   ”When I heard about this, I wanted to do it myself,” Trump told   Barrientos as he placed the Purple Heart on the soldier’’s lapel.   ”Congratulations   …     tremendous.” ’ ’   The medal is given to service members who were wounded or killed   in battle. ’ ’   Many on social media immediately criticized the president’s   choice of words to the wounded soldier whose leg had to be   amputated after he survived an attack in Afghanistan’s Helmland   province. ’ ’ ’ ’ ’t’t’tOh. ..dear. Really, believe me, no one seeks a Purple Heart. Truly.  ’ ” ’t’t’tHey military, y’all would Eat. A. Brother. Alive. If they did this. Whatcha gonna say bout Trump? Hope his staff learns him up right quick.  ” ’ ’t’t’tCongratulations? Like the Purple Heart is a prize? Trump is an idiot. Most of us always knew this.  ’ ’  It’’s rather like if Trump signed a condolence card to a widow ”congratulations”. Not everything we do to mark something is a congratulation. ’t’t’ ”  So inappropriate. You don’t congratulate a soldier for being wounded. You thank them for their service, dedication and sacrifice. ’t’t” ’   This isn’t the first time the president has been criticized for   remarks he made about the Purple Heart. During the campaign, a   veteran gave the   his Purple heart. ’ ’   ”I always wanted to get the Purple Heart. This was much easier,”    at the time. ’ ’ ’ ’Pres.
