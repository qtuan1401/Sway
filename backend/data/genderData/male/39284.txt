Washington (CNN) Americans are less approving of   Donald Trump than they were of previous presidents during their transitions into office, a new Pew Research Group poll shows.  Americans say Trump has also done too little to distance himself from white supremacists. And a majority are concerned that his business ties will present conflicts.  As Trump prepares to take office, 41% say they approve of the job he has done explaining his plans and policies for the future of the American people, while 55% say they disapprove of the job Trump has done.  That 41% approval rating is lower than President Barack Obama’s 72% in December 2008 and President George W. Bush’s 50% in January 2001    in the wake of a disputed election. It’s also lower than President Bill Clinton’s 62% in January 1993 and President George H. W. Bush’s 65% in March 1989.
