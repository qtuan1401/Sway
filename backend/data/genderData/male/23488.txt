National Republican frontrunner Donald Trump is dominating the race for the New Hampshire primary with about a month left to go, according to a Fox News poll released Friday. [Trump has 33 percent support in the poll, which is more than double his closest competitor, establishment favorite Marco Rubio, who clocks in at only 15 percent. Ted Cruz has 12 percent, and Jeb Bush places fourth with 9 percent.  Trump, who trails Cruz in Iowa by only four points with a   margin of error in another Fox poll released Friday, is also leading the field nationally, with Cruz placing second. Jeb Bush’s campaign  and a   super PAC are planning to drop a combined $14 million on TV ads in New Hampshire and the Boston television market ahead of the February 9 New Hampshire primary in a   effort to save his flailing campaign. The last two Republican winners in New Hampshire both went on to claim the GOP nomination, including John McCain in 2008 and Mitt Romney in 2012. The Fox News poll in New Hampshire surveyed 800 likely primary voters between January   with a margin of error of plus or minus three and a half percentage points.
