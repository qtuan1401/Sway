During his July 21 speech at the Republican National Convention, Maricopa County Sheriff Joe Arpaio described Donald Trump as a “law and order” candidate who “will build the wall” along the southern border to keep our nation secure. [Arpaio said:  We have criminals penetrating our weak border security system and committing serious crimes. I am supporting Donald Trump because he is a leader, he produces results, and is the only candidate for president ready to get tough in order to protect Americans. I have fought on the front lines to prevent illegal immigration and I know Donald Trump will stand with me and other proud Americans to secure our border. He added, “Donald Trump will build the wall!” as the RNC audience chanted, “Build the wall, Build the wall, Build the wall. ” Arpaio said Trump will also “restore law and order and keep drugs and illegal immigrants from entering out country. ” Arpaio concluded, “Let’s elect a leader who will stand up for America, and protect out border, and support law enforcement, and the military. And in doing so, [will] unite our country. Let’s elect Donald Trump!” AWR Hawkins is the Second Amendment columnist for Breitbart News and political analyst for Armed American Radio.
