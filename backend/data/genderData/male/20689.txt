On the Fox News Channel’s “Sunday Morning Futures with Maria Bartiromo,” former Speaker Newt Gingrich said Republican presidential candidate Sen. Ted Cruz ( ) must win “virtually all the delegates” in the upcoming Indiana primary to have a chance at securing the GOP nomination.  Gingrich said, “Indiana is make or break for Cruz, and it’s a bump in the road for Trump. If Cruz can’t win Indiana, and by win I mean, get virtually all the delegates, do something like close to what he did in Wisconsin, there’s no possibility that he can stop Trump. It’ll just be over sometime Wednesday morning. On the other hand, if Trump doesn’t do particularly well in Indiana, he has so much overall momentum, and it’s such a huge lead that he could still win by winning in New Jersey and California on June 7. So, for Trump it is a significant event. For Cruz, it’s life and death. ” Follow Pam Key On Twitter @pamkeyNEN
