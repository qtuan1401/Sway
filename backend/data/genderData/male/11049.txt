James McDaniel created a fake news website in February just for fun. In less than two weeks, UndergroundNewsReport. com had garnered more than 1 million page views and hundreds of dollars in advertising revenue. [McDaniel, a    Florida native now living in Costa Rica, told PolitiFact that he plans to donate the $615 in ad revenue to the 2020 Democratic presidential nominee.  The   PolitiFact  —   which became part of Facebook’s “fact checking” team tasked to label “fake news” stories as they appear on the social media platform  —   uncovered McDaniel’s website while flagging fake news. UndergroundNewsReport. com ran wild headlines like: “Bombshell: WikiLeaks leaks ‘lost’ Clinton email“ “Obama tweet: Trump must be removed, by any means necessary“ and “Whoopi Goldberg: Navy SEAL Widow was ‘Looking for Attention. ’”   McDaniel said that while he placed a warning on the website alerting readers that the news there was fake, he said most people were “willfully ignorant. ” Following harsh reaction to the story about Whoopi Goldberg and the Navy SEAL widow, McDaniel said is when the “fun” for him had stopped. “I might have carried on a bit longer because I was having fun,” McDaniel said, “but people took the Whoopi Goldberg story so seriously and it had gotten so big I thought I had better pull the plug. ” UndergroundNewsReport. com is still active. While his fake   days are over, McDaniel said he wants to keep the website up as a “relic. ” Follow Jerome Hudson on Twitter @jeromeehudson
