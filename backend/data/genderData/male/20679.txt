During the June 19 airing of Face the Nation, presumptive Republican presidential nominee Donald Trump described NRA leaders as “great Americans” who are motivated by the “best interests of our country. ”  Trump said these things after host John Dickerson tried to find some daylight between Trump and the NRA, when it comes to responding to Orlando terror attack. Dickerson asked, “Let me ask you about the NRA’s position on selling guns to people on the terror watch list and the   list. What’s the difference between your position and the NRA’s position?” Trump responded that his position is formed in conjunction with the NRA. He said: I have great respect for them. And Wayne [LaPierre] and Chris [Cox] and all of the people up there, these are great people and people who love their country incredibly. I don’t think they get enough for it. But I’m dealing with the NRA. You know they gave me their endorsement —  one of the earliest endorsements they’ve ever given for a presidential candidate. I’m a member of the NRA, my two sons are [long time] members of the NRA. He went on to explain that he is working with the NRA to see if there is a way the terror watch list can be used more effectively to keep guns out of terrorists hands. But Trump stressed that he is moving methodically because he does not want a situation where people who are inadvertently on the list get penalized. He added: Again, the NRA has the best interests of our country [at heart]. They want to make the right decision. These are great people and they are great Americans.
