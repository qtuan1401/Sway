Former failed presidential candidate Mitt Romney tried to get failed Republican presidential nominee John Kasich to mount a   run against presumptive nominee Donald Trump. [“Romney sent [Kasich] an email first urging him to run as an independent and saying he would do anything he needed to help,” a Kasich adviser told Yahoo News reporter Jon Ward.   The Kasich advisor revealed that Trump and Kasich spoke on the phone afterwards but that the Ohio governor “demurred. ” The Washington Post reports that Romney also reached out personally to   Republican Sen. Ben Sasse to encourage him to run. According to Ward’s report, Romney has ruled out the possibility that he will mount an independent campaign himself.
