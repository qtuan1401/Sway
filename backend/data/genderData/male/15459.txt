Sunday on MSNBC’s “AM Joy,” actor and director Rob Reiner called Donald Trump’s White House “a cancerous presidency that we cannot allow to spread. ”  Reiner said, “What’s interesting here is that we really have a test, and we are being tested as to whether or not our democracy is going to survive. We have somebody who’s mentally unstable, who is a pathological liar. There’s no getting around that, who’s running our country. ” “And if we can survive this, that will strengthen us in a strange way,” he added. “What you’re seeing all over the country with protests, I’ve been to many of them, is nothing like what I went through in the 60’s when I protested against the Vietnam War, this is everyone. It’s not just people worried about being killed in Vietnam, this is everyone. And so we’re looking at a cancerous presidency that we cannot allow to spread. ” Follow Pam Key on Twitter @pamkeyNEN
