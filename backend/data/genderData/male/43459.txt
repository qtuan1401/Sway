’  ’ ’   LONDON  —   British athlete Mo Farrah has described Donald Trump’’s   ban on people from certain Muslim countries from entering the USA   as a policy of ”hate and isolation” after learning that he is one   of the thousands of people affected by the contentious   executive order. ’ ’   banning people from seven countries with predominantly Muslim   populations from entering the country for at least 90 days. ’ ’   It has left thousands in a state of legal limbo, with people who   were already in transit detained in US airports overnight amid   nationwide protests. ’ ’   The countries blacklisted are Iraq, Iran, Libya, Somalia, Sudan,   Syria, and Yemen. ’ ’   The executive order also extends to those with dual citizenships   and, as a result, some British people are currently banned from   entering the US. One of these is Conservative Party MP Nadhim   Zahawi, who was born in Iraq, and British gold medal winner Mo   Farrah, who was born in Somalia before moving to Britain aged   eight. ’ ’’ ”   Farrah, who was knighted earlier this year after becoming the   most successful track athlete in Britain’s Olympic history,   released a statement that condemned the US President in strong   and moving terms. It said: ” ”   An online petition has since been launched calling on Donald   Trump’s planned state visit to the UK to be cancelled. If a   petition receives 100, 000 signatures or more then it must, by   law, be considered for parliamentary debate. This petition  —     titled   —   has nearly 150, 000 at the time of   writing. ”
