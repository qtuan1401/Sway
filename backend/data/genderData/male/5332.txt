(Want to get this briefing by email? Here’s the  .) Good evening. Here’s the latest. 1. Donald Trump railed at reporters for   his promises and revealing delays in donations he promised military veterans in January. “The press should be ashamed of themselves,” he said. “You make me look very bad. ” He also defended Trump University against testimony that was revealed as part of a lawsuit filed by dissatisfied former students. “I believe that Trump University was a fraudulent scheme,” said one sales manager at the school. _____ 2. The battle for California heated up a week ahead of the primary. Gov. Jerry Brown endorsed Hillary Clinton, but also spoke highly of Bernie Sanders. “He has driven home the message that the top 1 percent has unfairly captured way too much of America’s wealth, leaving the majority of people far behind,” Mr. Brown said in an open letter. Above, Mr. Sanders campaigned in Northern California. _____ 3. The sniffer dogs U. S. airports rely on to detect even the most minute trace of explosives  face new challenges as bombmakers shift to using household chemicals, like the compound TATP. “So we’re now asking dogs not just to find a needle in a haystack,” one expert said. “Now we’re also saying to the dog, ‘We need you to find any sharp object in the haystack.’ ” _____ 4. “It is practically a reinvented game these   Splash Brothers are playing. ” That’s our sports columnist, saluting Stephen Curry, above, and Klay Thompson for pushing the Golden State Warriors into the N. B. A. finals with 13   on Monday night. (Game 1 of the title rematch with the Cleveland Cavaliers: Thursday, 9 p. m. Eastern, at Golden State, ABC) _____ 5. The    party that took power in Poland in November is reviving efforts to extradite the filmmaker Roman Polanski to the U. S. the country’s close ally. The justice minister said he would appeal a court ruling that said turning over Mr. Polanski, 82, would be an “obviously unlawful” deprivation of liberty. He fled the U. S. decades ago, after pleading guilty to having sex with an underage girl. _____ 6.   militias, elite Iraqi Army counterterrorism forces and Sunni policemen are all taking part in the operation to drive Islamic State fighters out of the   city of Falluja. An estimated 50, 000 civilians are believed trapped with little food or medicine. _____ 7. The Cincinnati police said they were investigating how a    managed to get into a gorilla enclosure at the city’s zoo over the weekend. Zoo workers fatally shot the    gorilla after it dragged the boy around the pen, prompting complaints by animal rights activists and petitions blaming the boy’s mother. The police declined to identify the family. _____ 8. Our   story for days: a novelist’s essay on marriage. The bad news: Because we’re lonely, or mix love up with destructive tendencies, or think we can make happiness permanent, many of us marry the wrong people, he writes. The good: There really isn’t a perfect person to meet all of our needs anyway, so learn to tolerate differences. “Compatibility,” he concludes, “is an achievement of love it must not be its precondition. ” _____ 9. Federal data show that the number of homeless people over 50 has risen by about 20 percent since 2007, passing 300, 000 to make up some 31 percent of the nation’s total. Some people have been on the streets for a generation. “Skid Row is sad,” said a    homeless woman. “It is as sad as you can imagine. You literally have to live here to see how sad it is. ” _____ 10. Finally, can civil tensions be worked out in street theater? The spectacular Patum festival that wrapped up in Catalonia, Spain, dates to medieval times, but its evocation of the struggle between good and evil colorfully reflects the clashes between between right and left, church and state, the Spanish government in Madrid and Catalan secessionists. _____ Your Evening Briefing is posted at 6 p. m.
