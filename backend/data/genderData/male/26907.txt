A poll released Wednesday by USA   University shows that Vermont Socialist Bernie Sanders is stronger than Hillary Clinton when matched up against the four leading Republican candidates. Except for barely beating Ted Cruz, Bernie still loses against the other three. Hillary, however, loses to all four of her likely Republican rivals.  A big part of Hillary’s argument against Sanders is that she is more electable. Against Hillary: Donald Trump wins by +2 points,  45% to 43%. Ted Cruz wins by +1 point, 45% to 44%. Marco Rubio wins by +4 points, 42% to 46%. John Kasich smashes Clinton by +11 points, 49% to 38%. Against Bernie: Trump wins by +1 point, 44% to 43%. Cruz loses by   points, 42% to 44%. Rubio wins by +4 points, 46% to 42%. Kasich wins by +3 points, 44% to 41%.   Follow John Nolte on Twitter @NolteNC
