Jonathan Swan at The Hill writes that Donald Trump’s campaign views Republican House Speaker Paul Ryan as part of the ‘evil empire’ permanent political class that Democratic nominee Hillary Clinton also embodies. [From The Hill:  Trump on Tuesday unleashed a series of tweets directing scorn at the Speaker, who on Monday said he would no longer defend Trump and would instead focus on electing Republicans to the House.   …     Bannon views Ryan as a leader of an elite globalist cabal determined to sell out America by opening its borders on immigration and trade.   …     “Many   donors and party activists that were not necessarily early Trump supporters are very disappointed in Speaker Ryan,” the conservative figure said, “for not fully supporting the party’s candidate at this most critical time in our country. ” Another source close to Bannon predicted that more Republicans would follow the lead of California Rep. Dana Rohrabacher, who called Ryan “cowardly” for saying he’d no longer defend Trump. “Ryan’s agenda is not in line with the American worker. It’s in line with the Wall Street wing of the permanent political class,” the source close to Bannon said. “But it’s not just Ryan,” the source added, to characterize Bannon’s thinking. “Every institution in American politics has been exposed as fraudulent and working against the American people. ” “Trump is running against the evil empire,” the source continued. “The entire machine stands against him, and Paul Ryan is the face of the evil empire. But so is Hillary Clinton and so are her allies throughout the mainstream media. ” Read the rest here.
