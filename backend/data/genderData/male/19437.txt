The victim of a man who allegedly sexually harassed four women has told a local newspaper that the migrant told them that he hates Sweden and is only there so that he can “f*** Swedish girls”. [In a central square in Vimmerby, in the early hours of Sunday morning, four women were approached by a migrant shouting abuse, who then pulled his trousers down in front of them.  The man started to follow the young women and when they asked him to stop, telling him they felt uncomfortable with his behaviour, the 27 year old became aggressive. One of the women told the Dagens Vimmerby that, after becoming agitated, the migrant then began screaming that he hates Sweden and telling them that he’s only in the country to “f*** Swedish girls” and spend their money. The migrant then spat at the women, undressed in front of them and proceeded to urinate on a bench in the square. Police found the 27 year old in a side street shortly afterwards and arrested him on the spot for indecent exposure and sexual harassment. It was later found that the suspect had previously received a deportation order, because his request for asylum was rejected as invalid. The man has now been transferred to Skåne province, where he is in custody waiting for the expulsion to be enforced. Calle Persson, one of the policemen on duty in Vimmerby that night, warned however that criminal cases against migrants can delay their deportation. One of the alleged victims told the local newspaper about how the ordeal has affected her. On the same night, the 20 year old also reported to the police that she had been molested by a bald foreign man. The woman said that while she’s tried not to think about that night’s events, she now never wants to go out at night alone again.
