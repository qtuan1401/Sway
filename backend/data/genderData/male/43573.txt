’  ’ ’   President Donald Trump appeared to quip Tuesday that he would   ”destroy” the career of a state senator in Texas who introduced   legislation that a county sheriff doesn’’t like. ’ ”   Rockwall County Sheriff Harold Eavenson complained about the   senator to Trump during a meeting on Tuesday in the White House   with sheriffs from across the US. Eavenson will most likely be   the next president of the National Sheriffs’ Association,   . ” ’   ”A state senator in Texas was talking about introducing   legislation to require conviction before we could receive that   forfeiture money” from drug traffickers, Eavenson said. ’ ’   ”Can you believe that?” Trump replied. ’ ’   Eavenson continued: ”I told him that the cartel would build a   monument to him in Mexico if he could get that legislation   passed.” ’ ’   ”Who is the state senator?” Trump then asked. ”Do you want to   give his name?” ’ ’   Eavenson shrugged. ’ ’   ”We’’ll destroy his career,” Trump said as people around him   laughed. ’ ’ ’ ’Sheriff tells Trump that state senator is doing something he doesn’’t likeTrump: ”Do you want to give his name? We’’ll destroy his career.” ’ ”   It wasn’t immediately clear to whom Eavenson was referring, but a    that was recently introduced in the Texas Senate would   prohibit Texas law enforcement from seizing a person’s assets   before a conviction is won. Sen. Konni Burton, a Republican,   authored the bill, and Sen. Juan Hinojosa coauthored it. ” ’     agencies have largely opposed such bills. ’ ’President Donald Trump appeared to quip Tuesday. ..’
