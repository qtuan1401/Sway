About 200 people walked out of an Amy Schumer show in Tampa, Fla. on Sunday after she criticized Donald J. Trump onstage, The Tampa Bay Times reported. The comic, who is in the middle of a global arena tour, is an outspoken supporter of Hillary Clinton. During her set at Amalie Arena, she invited a Trump supporter up to the stage to defend the candidate. “Do you get worried at all with how impulsive he is, that he gets so fired up from ‘Saturday Night Live’ doing a skit on him?” she asked. She also called Mr. Trump an “orange,      monster. ” Video of the performance shows audience members booing and walking out. Ms. Schumer encouraged security to throw out the hecklers. “It’s too important,” she said as members of the crowd grew restless. “So we’re going to spend five minutes talking about it. ” In a statement to Vanity Fair, Ms. Schumer wrote: “I want to thank the 8, 400 people who stayed. We have always depended on comedians to make us laugh and tell the truth. I am proud to continue that tradition. ” In her set, Ms. Schumer talked about gun violence and attending Mrs. Clinton’s birthday party, two subjects she has covered in previous shows. She is to perform at Madison Square Garden on Tuesday.
