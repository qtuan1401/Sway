(Want to get this briefing by email? Here’s the  .) Good evening. Here’s the latest. 1. Hillary Clinton criticized Donald Trump for his derogatory comments on women and minorities in her first major speech as the presumptive Democratic presidential nominee. The venue, a Planned Parenthood event, underscored her current focus on rallying the Democratic base rather than appealing to the center. She followed up on two big endorsements, meeting with Senator Elizabeth Warren and having aides begin setting up President Obama’s campaign appearances. _____ 2. Mr. Trump lashed back at Mrs. Clinton and sought to rally evangelical Christians, speaking at the Faith and Freedom Coalition’s “Road to Majority” conference. Protesters disrupted the proceedings. The Senate majority leader, Mitch McConnell, offered an unexpectedly blunt view of Mr. Trump’s failings and left open the possibility of rescinding his endorsement. _____ 3. Gawker Media filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy and put itself up for sale. The company faces a $140 million legal judgment from an    lawsuit brought by the former wrestler Hulk Hogan, with the financial backing of the Silicon Valley billionaire Peter Thiel. Gawker still plans to appeal. Above, its founder, Nick Denton, after the initial verdict. _____ 4. Thousands of people turned out in Louisville, Ky. for a joyous celebration of the life of Muhammad Ali, the boxing legend and civil rights icon honored around the world. Bill Clinton, Billy Crystal, Bryant Gumbel and Ali’s wife, Lonnie, eulogized him. People in the street chanted “Ali” and threw flowers at his funeral cortege, slapping hands with members of the Ali family and the actor Will Smith. “He dared to love black people at a time when black people had a problem loving themselves,” a minister said. _____ 5. Hockey fans also lost an icon. Gordie Howe, the Detroit Red Wings player who loved the sport so much that he was a grandfather by the time he retired, died Friday at the age of 88. The consummate tough guy, he was beloved in Detroit, where he spent most of his 32 professional seasons. Scotty Bowman, one of hockey’s most successful coaches, once said, “In my estimation, he was the best ever. ” _____ 6. Three officers who served in New York City’s Correction Department were the latest to be convicted in the brutal beating of an inmate, a case that brought to light the pervasive culture of violence on Rikers Island. The district attorney said the convictions “send a clear message that a uniform and a badge do not absolve anyone from committing a crime, and that even an inmate deserves to be treated like a human being. ” _____ 7. Malia Obama graduated from the prestigious Sidwell Friends high school in Washington. But social media appeared to pay more attention to two graduates in Texas, one of them above. The young women were met with support and outrage for declaring themselves to be undocumented immigrants as they left their Texas high schools. One is going to Yale, the other the University of Texas at Austin. _____ 8. The N. B. A. ushered in a hectic sports weekend, with the Golden State Warriors beating the Cleveland Cavaliers,   to take a   lead in the finals. The L. P. G. A. championship continues in Washington State, where Brooke Henderson held the lead after the first round (NBC and the Golf Channel, check listings for times). And Exaggerator, the Preakness winner, is the early favorite in the Belmont Stakes (post time 6:32 p. m. Eastern,  . com). _____ 9. Finally, Noah’s ark suffered a modern calamity. This replica, built by a Dutch carpenter using the biblical description as a blueprint, crashed into a Norwegian Coast Guard patrol in Oslo when the crew towing the wooden vessel lost control. “It is unclear what happened to the 8. 7 million x 2 animals on board,” a city resident tweeted. Have a great weekend. _____ Jonah Bromwich contributed reporting.  Your Evening Briefing is posted at 6 p. m. Eastern. And don’t miss Your Morning Briefing, posted weekdays at 6 a. m.
