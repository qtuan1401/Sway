Sunday on CBS’s “Face The Nation,” former House Speaker Newt Gingrich said   Donald Trump needs to have a “very, very aggressive” first year in office to be successful.  Gingrich said Trump should, “Swing for the fences. ” He added, “This is a city which if you don’t shove it as hard as you can while you have momentum, they will surround you. I mean, the swamp doesn’t want to be drained. And the swamp will just suck you in if you let it, so he needs to have a very, very aggressive first year. ” Follow Pam Key on Twitter @pamkeyNEN
