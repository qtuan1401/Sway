’  ’ ’   Donald Trump suggested that an ”attack first” strategy might be   best when confronting America’’s enemies. ’ ”   During a town hall event in Sandown, New Hampshire, on Friday,   the Republican presidential candidate expressed contempt for   Hillary Clinton’s plan to fight terror groups like ISIS. ” ’   Clinton, the Democratic nominee,  supply line disruptions and increased airstrikes   to drive ISIS militants out of key areas of Iraq and Syria. ’ ’   Trump, who has not yet publicly discussed details of his   campaign’’s   proposals, asked on Thursday: ”Isn’’t   there an element of surprise?” ’ ’   ”Remember when we were young and we were studying history, and   they talk about some of the great generals, and the great   attacks? . .. Wouldn’t it be nice if we attacked first, and talked   about our great victory later?” ’ ’   ”It’’s a very, very sad thing. We are being run by people that are   incompetent,” the Manhattan billionaire said. ’ ’   Clinton, who served as secretary of state during President Barack   Obama’’s first term, has criticized Trump for not outlining the   specifics of his plans to fight terrorism  —   : ”He says it’’s a   secret plan, but the only secret is that he has no plan,” Clinton   suggested. ’ ’ ’
