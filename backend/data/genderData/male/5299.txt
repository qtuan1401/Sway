Donald J. Trump on Wednesday unveiled a list of prospective Supreme Court nominees, seeking to pacify veteran Republicans who fear he does not take judicial matters seriously and to reassure conservatives that his appointees would reflect a   philosophy. Here is a look at his possible picks: Born: 1963 Position: United States Court of Appeals for the Eighth Circuit Background: Judge Colloton, who was nominated by President George W. Bush in 2003, once clerked for Chief Justice William H.

Bennett, a secretary of education in the Reagan administration, before attending law school. _____ Born: 1963 Position: United States Court of Appeals for the Eighth Circuit Background: Judge Gruender, who has been suggested by conservatives as a possible nominee before, was nominated for his current post by President Bush in 2003. He has also worked as a prosecutor, serving as the United States attorney for the Eastern District of Missouri, in St. Louis. His political background includes working as Missouri state political director for Bob Dole’s 1996 presidential campaign. _____ Born: 1965 Position: United States Court of Appeals for the Third Circuit Background: Judge Hardiman was nominated by President Bush in 2003 after over a decade in private practice. He grew up in Waltham, Mass. and graduated from Notre Dame. Among his notable cases was a 2014 decision overturning Philadelphia’s   ban on political contributions by police officers. _____ Born: 1966 Position: United States Court of Appeals for the Sixth Circuit Background: Judge Kethledge, confirmed months before President Bush left office, worked as a clerk for Justice Anthony M. Kennedy. This year, he wrote a decision ordering the Internal Revenue Service to provide information about   applications as part of a Tea Party lawsuit that accused the agency of unfairly targeting conservatives. _____ Born: 1968 Position: Michigan Supreme Court Background: Judge Larsen, who was named to the state court last fall by Gov. Rick Snyder, a Republican, is up for election in November to complete the term, which expires in 2018.

Judge Pryor initially supported Judge Moore but wound up leading the prosecution that led to his ouster from the bench. _____ Born: 1974 Position: Minnesota Supreme Court Background: Justice Stras, who has been on the court since 2010 and was elected to a   term in 2012, was previously a faculty member at the University of Minnesota Law School. His selection six years ago by Gov. Tim Pawlenty, a Republican, stunned much of the state’s judicial world, given Mr. Stras’s age at the time (35) and that he had spent most of his time in academia. _____ Born: 1957 Position: United States Court of Appeals for the Seventh Circuit Background: Judge Sykes, who was nominated by President Bush in 2003, has been mentioned before by Mr. Trump as a possible choice.
