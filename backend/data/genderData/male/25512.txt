Sen. Marco Rubio is not only going to go to the Republican convention that will nominate Donald Trump as the presidential nominee, he would be willing to speak for his former rival and release his delegates to him. [“My sense is I’m going to go to the convention,” Rubio said in an interview with Jake Tapper aired on Thursday. Rubio admitted that he would he “honored” to speak for the Republican nominee if Trump asked him to speak at the convention.  The Florida senator’s decision is markedly different from many of Trump’s vanquished presidential rivals such as Jeb Bush who vowed not to attend the convention. Rubio said that if his campaign hadn’t released his delegates to Trump for the convention, he would be willing to make that happen. “I want to be helpful, I don’t want to be harmful because I don’t want Hillary to be president,” Rubio said. He admitted, however, that he still had policy differences with Donald Trump. When pressed by Tapper on whether he would accept the opportunity of being Trump’s running mate, Rubio replied in the negative. “In my view it wouldn’t be the right choice for him,” he said. “He deserves to have a running mate that more fully embraces some of the things he stands for. ”
