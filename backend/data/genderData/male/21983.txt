On this weekend’s broadcast of “Fox News Sunday,”  during the panel discussion about the recent police shootings in North Carolina and Oklahoma,  political analyst Juan Williams said, “I just worry that there’s a lot of white denial about what is a very racial situation that unfairly burdens people of color in American society. ”  Discussing Trump’s policies, Williams said, “Well, when he talks about  —   Rachel, when he talks about kicking out, a deportation force, kicking out everybody, when he talks about Mexicans as rapists and murderers, when he speaks in this way, he is not talking about increasing opportunity. And when he talks about stop and frisk, as Chris said to Joel Benenson, he’s talking about an unconstitutional tactic that unfairly burdens young people of color. ” He continued,” You know what  …    I just worry that there’s a lot of white denial about what is a very racial situation that unfairly burdens people of color in American society. And that in the midst of this campaign  —   He added,”If you focus  —   if you focus on the raindrops, you can miss the coming storm. And there is a storm in this country over this issue. ” Follow Pam Key on Twitter @pamkeyNEN
