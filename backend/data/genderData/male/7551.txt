(Want to get this briefing by email? Here’s the  .) Good evening. Here’s the latest. 1. On the eve of the New Jersey and California primaries, a survey by The Associated Press found that Hillary Clinton had enough delegates to clinch the nomination. The campaign manager for Senator Bernie Sanders of Vermont said in a statement that The A. P.’s ruling was “unfortunate” and “a rush to judgment. ” Mr. Sanders had hoped that a victory in California might persuade party leaders to back him. President Obama has yet to endorse either candidate, but his aides have said that he is eager to campaign on behalf of Mrs. Clinton and is particularly enthusiastic about taking on Donald J. Trump. _____ 2. As Iraqi forces and their Shiite militia allies try to wrest the city of Falluja from the grip of the Islamic State militants, thousands of civilians have fled, braving the perils of nighttime journeys and the militants’ gunfire to make it out. But at least 50, 000 more are trapped inside, and as many as 20, 000 may be children. Aid workers worry that many will be threatened by starvation if the siege wears on. _____ 3. After a lackluster jobs report in May, the Federal Reserve may be rethinking its plan to raise interest rates. Janet L. Yellen, the Fed’s chairwoman, gave a speech on Monday in which she did not repeat her past remarks about a rate increase “in the coming months. ” She insisted though, that one bad report would not cause the Fed to chart an entirely new course: The bank could still decide to raise rates in the summer or the fall. _____ 4. A sexual assault case that had already made its way through court drew fresh attention after the victim’s entire statement to her attacker in court was published. The defendant, a former student at Stanford University, was sentenced to six months in jail after being convicted of three counts of sexual assault, a punishment that many critics said was far too lenient. An effort has been mounted to recall the judge who handed out the sentence. _____ 5. The Cavaliers have lost the first two games of the N. B. A. Finals by a combined margin of 48 points. In other words, they’re getting crushed by the Golden State Warriors, who are intent on capturing their second consecutive championship. Our analyst places much of the blame on the shoulders of the Cavs’ superstar, LeBron James. After all, he writes, “this was the team the King himself courted. ” _____ 6. The Ohio woman whose son wandered into a gorilla exhibit, leading to the fatal shooting of a silverback named Harambe, will not face charges, a state prosecutor announced Monday. “She was being attentive to her children by all witness accounts,” the prosecutor said. “And the    just scampered off. ” The episode has raised questions about whether gorillas really belong in zoos. _____ 7. American sailors stationed in Japan were prohibited from drinking after an officer was arrested in connection with a car accident that left two Japanese civilians injured. Resentment against the U. S. military on Okinawa has been rising, and the arrest of the sailor, who was thought to be drunk, caused a public outcry. _____ 8. If Mark Zuckerberg is vulnerable to hacking, then who among us is safe? That was the question after news broke that the Facebook billionaire was the victim of a hacking collective, which broke into several of his social media accounts. The simplest way to avoid a similar fate? Use different passwords for different websites, and change them frequently. _____ 9. New Yorkers often think of Pennsylvania Station as a grim purgatory, one best avoided if possible. Yet some of the most beautiful music ever written  —   Mozart, Beethoven  —   is piped into the station. The D. J. s are not fellow travelers, but three Texan women who attempt to anticipate the music that will best soothe   Gothamites. _____ 10. Rain kept Kanye West from performing at the Governors Ball music festival on Sunday. So the rapper displayed the extent of his powers: He signaled that he would play a concert at 2 in the morning at another venue in the East Village. A crowd materialized out of thin air, but the concert was not to be. The closest Mr. West came to performing was to emerge briefly from the sunroof of a car he was riding in. _____ 11. Most of us would never imagine wanting to track the brain signals of amorous flies, or that the task might present a tricky problem. A paper released last month details the way a team of California scientists worked their way through that experiment using cameras, lasers and   surgery, in which the tops of the creatures’ heads were replaced by tiny glass windows. _____ 12. Muhammad Ali broke all the rules of boxing. So what made him a champion? Fast feet. A pesky jab. An iron jaw. A lean frame. And a cunning, calculating,   mind. That final attribute also contributed to his singular status as a politically outspoken, unapologetically black athlete who never sold out, our columnist writes. _____ Your Evening Briefing is posted at 6 p. m.
