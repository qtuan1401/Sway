’  ’ ’   Former Republican House Majority Leader Tom DeLay said Monday   that President Donald Trump’’s suggestion he would be ”totally   open” to working with Democrats after the failure of the American   Health Care Act was ”very dangerous” politically and a ”rookie   mistake.” ’ ’   The Texas Republican cited former House Speaker John Boehner and   President George H. W. Bush on CNN as example of Republicans   who did exactly that and hurt themselves. ’ ’   ”It’’s not a good idea,” DeLay told the cable news outlet. ”Just   because you’’re upset with the Republicans and conservatives  —   who   are standing on principal by the way  —   and it’’s sort of a rookie   mistake [to say] that, ’’well, now I’’m going to work with the   Democrats. ’’” ’ ’   ”It’’s very dangerous and very risky,” he continued. ’ ’   After the AHCA  —   the bill which aimed to repeal and replace   the Affordable Care Act  —   was pulled from the House floor   Friday after it was clear it would not have enough votes to pass,   Trump said he was willing to work with Democrats on future   health care initiatives ”when they all become civilized.” ’ ’   DeLay resigned from Congress in 2006 following his deputy chief   of staff pleading guilty to conspiracy and corruption charges as   a part of the Jack Abramoff scandal. DeLay was   earlier indicted on charges of conspiracy and money   laundering as a part of a campaign finance investigation, which   led him to step down as House majority leader. He was later found   guilty but subsequently had the convictions overturned and   he was acquitted. ’ ’Former Republican House Majority Leader Tom. ..’ ’’ ’’ ’’
