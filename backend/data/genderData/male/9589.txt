COVFEFE from Union Pub on Capitol Hill! [Former FBI Director James Comey, who was fired by President Donald J. Trump, will testify before the Senate Intelligence Committee on Thursday morning —  and Washington, D. C. elites are gathered at their favorite watering holes throughout the city to watch the giant   testimony.  Breitbart News will be covering the political class celebration from here, with this livewire including updates on Comey’s testimony and the reaction of the crowd of Washington elites. Union Pub, a landmark Washington, D. C. bar across the street from the Heritage Foundation on Capitol Hill, is offering all patrons who come here to watch the testimony free drinks whenever President Trump Tweets about the Comey hearing throughout its duration until 4 p. m. UPDATE 12:54 P. M. President Trump did not Tweet throughout the entire event, but Union Pub is still giving out a few round of   Budweisers to everyone here! The specialty Budweiser cans, which servers are passing out now, have the special “America” name in place of “Budweiser” on the label and a camouflage design instead of the traditional red cans. Here’s a photo from Breitbart’s Kristina Wong: . @UnionPub giving out free America Budweisers at #ComeyHearing #Covfefe: pic. twitter.   —   Kristina Wong (@kristina_wong) June 8, 2017,  And another from Breitbart News’ Penny Starr: Cheers! Comey reveals he’s a leaker and New York Times pushes FAKE NEWS! @BreitbartNews #comey pic. twitter.   —   Penny Starr (@PennyStarrDC) June 8, 2017,  That’s all folks, we’ll leave it there for today. COVFEFE to everyone and thanks for tuning in! UPDATE 12:50 P. M. As the public part of the hearing adjourned, and Comey has completely vindicated Trump ahead of a later closed session hearing where he and senators are likely to discuss classified information he could not bring up during the televised hearing, the whole thing turned out exactly like Breitbart News Network told you it would: A giant  . Except for the fact that Comey admitted he is a leaker, has a network through which he has leaked information designed to harm President Trump. Oh, and that former Attorney General Loretta Lynch and other Obama administration officials may have engaged in serious misconduct worthy of further investigation —  which Comey testified about today. Meanwhile, White House spokeswoman Sarah Huckabee Sanders —  from the podium at the press briefing —  has told reporters that President Trump is not, despite what the leaker James Comey says, a liar. . @SHSanders45: ”No, I can definitively say the president is not a liar. It’s frankly insulting that that question would be asked.”  —   Zeke Miller (@ZekeJMiller) June 8, 2017,  And, of course, nevertheless President Trump persisted. He’s right back out there fighting for American workers while Democrats waste their time on   nonsense.

M. Sen. John McCain ( ) a grumpy old   Republican, made no sense during his questioning of Comey. Breitbart’s own Curt Schilling, the host of Whatever It Takes, questions whether everyone else had trouble following along with McCain’s nonsensical line of questioning: Am I the only one not able to follow along with senator McCain’s line of questioning? ???  —   Curt Schilling (@gehrig38) June 8, 2017,  Even the New York Times’ people questions whether McCain is losing his mind: McCain seems to be confusing the Clinton email case with the Russia investigation.  —   Peter Baker (@peterbakernyt) June 8, 2017,  Trump, who has not Tweeted during the hearing at all, apparently made the decision to avoid Tweeting last night. Politico’s Tara Palmeri has the scoop of why the President would not Tweet today, infuriating all the Union Pub   who did not get any free drinks since President Trump did not Tweet. Trump decided the night before #comeyhearings that he would not   his rebuttal https:  .   —   Tara Palmeri (@tarapalmeri) June 8, 2017,  “Why would I?” Trump apparently told White House aides about   Comey’s appearance before Congress, according to a “senior White House official” who spoke with Politico’s Palmeri. Read the whole thing, including the details on how the president’s mood is “light” during the Comey testimony. UPDATE 12:37 P. M. Their hopes and dreams dashed by Comey completely vindicating Trump in this open hearing, and instead implicating   administration officials like Loretta Lynch —  and implicating himself as an   leaker with a network through which he has leaked damaging information against the president —  the left and media are pinning everything on a last ditch line of questioning from Sen. Kamala Harris ( ). This line of questioning from @SenKamalaHarris regarding the Attorney General is extraordinarily important  —   not to be overlooked,  —   Matt House (@mattwhouse) June 8, 2017,  Here’s video of her comparing Trump to an armed robber though, so take whatever she says with a grain of salt: Sen. Kamala Harris seems to compare Trump to an armed robber saying ”I hope you will give me your wallet” #ComeyTestimony pic. twitter.   —   Mike Ciandella ن (@MikeCiandella) June 8, 2017,  But MSNBC leftist media star Andrea Mitchell loves Kamala Harris, heavily highlighting the rookie Democrat Senator’s questions: . @KamalaHarris asks series of q’s about possible secret contacts between Trump camp and Russia #Comey declines to answer in open hearing,  —   Andrea Mitchell (@mitchellreports) June 8, 2017,  Meanwhile,   Never Trumper Max Boot is in an alternate reality, saying Comey was fantastic as a witness. Bottom line for #ComeyDay: Comey a highly credible witness. Trump isn’t. Comey makes damning accusations. Trump denials unconvincing.  —   Max Boot (@MaxBoot) June 8, 2017,  Flashback, though, to when Comey was fired and Boot with some bold predictions back on May 9: Congress needs to ask Comey to testify  he needs to tell all he knows about Kremlingate. If he does Trump may regret firing him.  —   Max Boot (@MaxBoot) May 10, 2017,  Don’t tell Max Boot about the black helicopters coming for him. Seriously. “KREMLINGATE”? What is wrong with these people? Anyway, another wonderfully fantastic flashback of this Never Trumper from when Comey was fired in May: Prediction: If Democrats take control of Congress in 2018, the firing of Comey will form one of the articles of impeachment.  —   Max Boot (@MaxBoot) May 10, 2017,  UPDATE 12:24 P. M. Harvard law professor Alan Dershowitz is calling for the Senate to officially subpoena the documents James Comey ordered leaked through his network of leakers. Senators should ask Comey the name of the Columbia professor and then subpoena the memos from him.  —   Alan Dershowitz (@AlanDersh) June 8, 2017,  UPDATE 12:21 P. M. Loretta Lynch is in serious trouble right now. Looks like the Democrats’ efforts may have backfired. Loretta Lynch is having a surprisingly bad day in the Comey testimony,  —   Chris Cillizza (@CillizzaCNN) June 8, 2017,  If it wasn’t for Trump becoming president, the corruption with Obama’s Department of Justice would be a major story. https:  .   —   Josh Kraushaar (@HotlineJosh) June 8, 2017,  Comey also just testified that he did not believe that Lynch could “credibly deny” the Hillary Clinton email scandal investigation, and that she had a serious conflict of interest. He also testified in exchange with Sen. John Cornyn ( ) the Senate Majority Whip, that it is possible a special prosecutor was needed for the email scandal. He said he considered calling for appointing a special counsel in the scandal, but decided against it. UPDATE 12:08 P. M. Oh my. Now confirmed leaker James Comey’s leak network has been outed, or at least part of it has: Only in Washington: Someone nursing a pint of beer shouts out to a crowded bar: ”Daniel Richman of Columbia” https:  .   —   Alexander Panetta (@Alex_Panetta) June 8, 2017,  So the collusion involves former FBI director, mainstream media, and the   academy to bring down the elected president #ComeyHearing https:  .   —   Joel B. Pollak (@joelpollak) June 8, 2017,  And now Comey’s   leak network is confirming to the media that Comey is a leaker: Columbia Law Prof Daniel Richman confirms to @ZCohenCNN that he is the friend that provided excerpts of the Comey memo to reporters.  —   Ryan Nobles (@ryanobles) June 8, 2017,    UPDATE 12:05 P. M. There are now serious questions being raised as to whether Loretta Lynch, the former Attorney General from the Obama administration, will be subpoenaed to testify after this hearing where Comey has implicated her. Legit question: is Loretta Lynch going to be subpoenaed as a result of this testimony?  —   Mike Shields (@mshields007) June 8, 2017,  Meanwhile, Comey’s admission he is a leaker serious hurts him. Jonathan Turley of George Washington University Law School makes the case Comey may be in serious trouble: Comey admits that he leaked the internal memo through a Columbia law professor in order to force Special Counsel. Yet, that raises questions,  —   Jonathan Turley (@JonathanTurley) June 8, 2017,  Comey is doing well but leaking info runs against Comey’s image, particularly in light of the leak controversy hoiunding the Administration,  —   Jonathan Turley (@JonathanTurley) June 8, 2017,  The memos could be viewed as gov’t material and potential evidence .  Leaking to a friend for disclosure can raise serious questions.  —   Jonathan Turley (@JonathanTurley) June 8, 2017,  UPDATE 12:02 P. M. Donald Trump, Jr. highlights an excellent question from Sen. Roy Blunt ( ) to Comey. Comey did not have a great answer. Sen Blunt: If you told Sessions you didn’t want to be alone with Trump again, why did you continue to take his calls?  —   Donald Trump Jr. (@DonaldJTrumpJr) June 8, 2017,  UPDATE 12:01 P. M. From our RNC friends, here’s video of Sen. Rubio crushing another leftist media narrative during his questioning of Comey.  Basically, Comey was so concerned about President Trump’s conversations with him that he alerted exactly nobody who could do anything about it. In other words, this whole thing is a giant  . Except for Comey implicating himself as a leaker. UPDATE 11:58 A. M. Comey is in big trouble after this hearing. He admitted he’s a leaker, and has an actual network through which he leaks information to the press. In addition, he withheld from leaking information that would have vindicated President Trump weeks ago. White House social media director Dan Scavino captures it clearly and concisely on Twitter: Because if it was leaked that @realDonaldTrump was personally not under   it would have crushed the entire narrative. pic. twitter.   —   Dan Scavino Jr. (@DanScavino) June 8, 2017,  President Trump still has yet to Tweet, so no free drinks yet here at Union Pub. Looks like the owners here made a smart decision since this place is standing room only right now. UPDATE 11:54 A. M. Oh, man, this keeps getting better and better. Comey just shredded the Democrats AND now the fake news media. Oh Boy. Comey says there have been many many stories based on classified information about Russia that are just ”dead wrong”  —   Maeve Reston (@MaeveReston) June 8, 2017,  I wonder if any of the media outlets that have printed repeated stories on these matters will check their reporting again or correct it if they’re wrong. Not holding my breath. UPDATE 11:50 A. M. Comey has emerged throughout this hearing before the American people looking very much like a drama queen. One of the more memorable lines is when he says when Trump called him to ask him if he was free for dinner, he had to break a date with his wife. Comey says Trump called him at his desk. ”Free for dinner tonight? ””I said yessir  …    I had to call my wife and break a date with her.”  —   Jennifer Jacobs (@JenniferJJacobs) June 8, 2017,  That’s not the only   Comey testimony: COMEY JUST QUOTES HENRY 11 on what he thought Trump meant: ’Will no one rid me of this toublesome priest”  —   Trip Gabriel (@tripgabriel) June 8, 2017,  Meanwhile, even CNN’s Jim Acosta —  a vehemently   media figure in the heart of the opposition party’s mothership CNN —  is joining in on the   fun. Giving info to media ”like feeding seagulls at the beach?” Fact check: True.  —   Jim Acosta (@Acosta) June 8, 2017,  UPDATE 11:48 A. M. The leaky Capitol Hill GOP swamp aides are attacking Trump, despite the fact Comey has vindicated the president and implicated himself in potentially illegal leaks. Senate R aide: Holding nose and defending Trump is taking a lot out of these GOP senators  —   and they will demand some kind of repayment  …      —   Glenn Thrush (@GlennThrush) June 8, 2017,  The fact that Swamp Creatures on the “Republican” side on Capitol Hill are throwing shade on their own president, and party, as the GOP and Trump likely emerge from today’s masquerade mostly out of the woods is simply incredible but unsurprising. Swamp Things are going to Swamp. UPDATE 11:45 A. M. Comey’s open admission he orchestrated a potentially illegal leak puts him in serious potential trouble, the New York Times people note. That’s the story folks. He vindicated Trump, and implicated himself. Wow, what a day. Can’t remember the last time someone in DC openly acknowledged orchestrating a leak  —   and without any senator having even asked.  —   Peter Baker (@peterbakernyt) June 8, 2017,  UPDATE 11:39 A. M. CNN’s Dan Merica says that President Trump’s personal lawyer Marc Kasowitz will make a statement at the end of Comey’s public testimony. Marc Kasowitz, Trump’s lawyer outside the White House, will make a statement at the end of James Comey’s Senate testimony,  —   Dan Merica (@danmericaCNN) June 8, 2017,  UPDATE 11:35 A. M. As Comey continues vindicating Trump and throwing Democrats like Lynch, Obama, and Clinton under the bus —  presumably accidentally —  the Washington, D. C. daydrinking party scene is in full swing: Spotted at Duffy’s Irish Pub in North DC:”Comey is my homey.” pic. twitter.   —   Sharon Nunn (@sharonmnunn) June 8, 2017,  Her “homey” James Comey, meanwhile, has actually admitted he is a leaker. Flag: Comey says he had a friend of his leak the content of his memo to a reporter to hopefully prompt the appointment of a special counsel. pic. twitter.   —   Kyle Griffin (@kylegriffin1) June 8, 2017,  Comey admits to @SenatorCollins that he asked a friend to leak the contents of his memo to NYT to prompt the appointment of Special Counsel.  —   Joel B. Pollak (@joelpollak) June 8, 2017,  Here’s video of Comey admitting he has been leaking information to the media: Here’s how I leaked my Trump memo after Trump’s “tapes” tweet, by: James Comey pic. twitter.   —   Bradd Jaffy (@BraddJaffy) June 8, 2017,  UPDATE 11:32 A. M. While obstruction is now off the table for Trump, as Breitbart’s Joel Pollak detailed, Breitbart’s John Hayward notes that obstruction is back on the table for several leading officials from now former President Barack Obama’s administration. Hayward says Congress needs to investigate Loretta Lynch, the former Attorney General, as well as Obama and former Secretary of State Hillary Rodham Clinton —  the 2016 Democratic presidential nominee —  for obstruction of justice. Big takeaway from the Comey hearing: urgent need to investigate Loretta Lynch, Barack Obama, and Hillary Clinton for obstruction,  —   John Hayward (@Doc_0) June 8, 2017,  UPDATE 11:29 A. M. Our very own Joel Pollak is out with another bombshell piece detailing how this hearing has shattered the media’s and the Democrats’ efforts to taint President Trump with “obstruction of justice. ” “Democrats have hinged their hopes for impeachment  —   and reversing the 2016 elections  —   on the idea that Trump committed obstruction of justice. That case has now been smashed beyond repair,” Pollak writes, pointing to a Comey exchange with Sen. Jim Risch ( ). Read his whole story here. UPDATE 11:26 A. M. Former Mexican President Vicente Fox, who has trolled Trump as much as he possibly can over the campaign and since, is joining with Union Pub patrons —  who get free drinks if President Trump Tweets about the Comey hearing —  in raising concerns with the lack of Tweets today from President Trump. . @realDonaldTrump’s silence on #ComeyDay concerns me. What’s  going on, Don? I hope you don’t hurt your fingers ranting against Comey later.  —   Vicente Fox Quesada (@VicenteFoxQue) June 8, 2017,  UPDATE 11:25 A. M. Entirely unsurprising, but leading Never Trumper Ana Navarro bashes the president —  again —  and praises Comey. Lot of time left, but so far, Comey is coming across as the consummate professional. A man who loves his country, colleagues  agency.  —   Ana Navarro (@ananavarro) June 8, 2017,  UPDATE 11:24 A. M. Since Comey has blown up the entire media narrative, essentially, Ric Grenell —  a leading conservative   advocate —  notes that the media is only using “facts” that fit their worldview. Breaking: DC reporters are NOT tweeting the line where Comey destroys their anonymous sourced narratives.  —   Richard Grenell (@RichardGrenell) June 8, 2017,  Kayleigh McEnany, one of the only   voices on the opposition party network CNN, Tweets another homerun: Of all the leaks, the one thing that never leaked was that the President was NOT under investigation.   Very suspicious! #ComeyDay,  —   Kayleigh McEnany (@kayleighmcenany) June 8, 2017,  And Ann Coulter for the win: OBVIOUSLY Trump’s request re: Flynn was to “let go” of Trump’s firing of him. MSM was falsely claiming reason 4 firing was contacts w Russia,  —   Ann Coulter (@AnnCoulter) June 8, 2017,  UPDATE 11:21 A. M. from this morning’s Breitbart News Daily on SiriusXMTom Fitton of Judicial Watch,  says there is no evidence of any wrongdoing by President Trump or his team. And he called the special counsel “wasteful. ” If Robert Mueller, the special counsel, comes up with nothing as every one of his contemporaries has before him, it will be the biggest waste of taxpayer dollars —  and of Americans’ time —  in a long time. Listen to the audio here, or at the link to the story from our own Dan Riehl: UPDATE 11:16 A. M. James Comey finally confirms before a congressional committee in a public setting —  on video —  that President Donald Trump is not under FBI investigation. James Comey confirms President Trump was not under investigation while he was FBI director https:  .  https:  .   —   CNN Breaking News (@cnnbrk) June 8, 2017,  UPDATE 11:15 A. M. During Comey’s back and forth with Sen. Marco Rubio ( ) the former 2016 Trump GOP primary rival astutely noted that basically the only thing that did not leak to the press is the one fact that would have helped Trump —  that Trump himself was not under investigation. That is despite the fact that Congressional leaders were briefed on that point. Rubio Comey back forth indicates Gang of 8 was briefed that Trump was not personally under investigation.  —   Laura Rozen (@lrozen) June 8, 2017,  UPDATE 11:11 A. M. Donald Trump, Jr. joins the fray on Twitter, defending his father —  the president —  from Comey’s ambiguous claims.   Flynn stuff is BS in context 2 guys talking about a guy they both know well. I hear ”I hope nothing happens but you have to do your job”  —   Donald Trump Jr. (@DonaldJTrumpJr) June 8, 2017,    very far from any kind of coercion or influence and certainly not obstruction!  —   Donald Trump Jr. (@DonaldJTrumpJr) June 8, 2017,  Trump, Jr. says there is no way Comey would have misunderstood the president.   Knowing my father for 39 years when he ”orders or tells” you to do something  there is no ambiguity, you will know exactly what he means,  —   Donald Trump Jr. (@DonaldJTrumpJr) June 8, 2017,  He also notes that Comey has testified that he could be “wrong. ” Comey ”I could be wrong”  —   Donald Trump Jr. (@DonaldJTrumpJr) June 8, 2017,  Donald Trump, Jr. ’s Tweets come as many here at Union Pub —  who will get free drinks if the president himself Tweets about Comey —  are disappointed that President Trump himself is not Tweeting. This is probably the first time ever that people in Washington, D. C. —  the Swamp —  are upset that President Donald Trump is NOT Tweeting. UPDATE 11:10 A. M. Video of Comey wishing there are tapes of his conversations with Trump: Comey: ”I’ve seen the tweet about tapes. Lordy, I hope there are tapes.” (via @MSNBC) pic. twitter.   —   Kyle Griffin (@kylegriffin1) June 8, 2017,  UPDATE 11:07 A. M. Breitbart’s Joel Pollak has an excellent piece up already on how Comey’s opening statement to the Committee this morning is all about him. “Former FBI director James Comey opened his testimony before the Senate Intelligence Committee on Thursday by complaining about ‘shifting explanations’ for why he had been fired, and by attacking the Trump administration,” Pollak writes. “Comey said that he had originally intended to accept his firing quietly, but then found that the administration’s statements about the matter ‘confused me and increasingly concerned me.’ He said that President Donald Trump had assured him that he was doing a good job, and that he had assured the president in return that he intended to stay. ” Read the whole thing. Also, it’s worth noting that even the Wall Street Journal —  not some rightwing blog by any stretch —  even says that Comey’s written opening statement proves that President Trump should have fired him. Which is exactly what President Trump did. Read the Journal’s editorial board piece here. UPDATE 11: 00 A. M. The GOP war room is up and running. Our friends over at the Republican National Committee are cutting videos that shows Comey’s testimony actually fully vindicates President Trump, despite whatever the opposition party media and congressional Democrats say:  Politico has an RNC talking points document circulated this morning. Read the whole thing here. Politico also has a story on how the RNC is taking the lead on pushing back on the highly discredited Comey’s testimony. “The RNC’s role is to support and defend the president and this White House and this week is no different,” Ryan Mahoney, the RNC communications director, told Politico. “And we prepare for everything, and we’re prepared for the hearing this week. ” Read the whole piece here. UPDATE 10:59 A. M. Despite the fact there have been a number of inaccurate pieces throughout the establishment media, the establishment media is celebrating itself. Most interesting part of Comey memo: How damn good the reporting has been. On. The. Nose.  —   Jennifer Rubin (@JRubinBlogger) June 8, 2017,  Also, fun: Sen. Feinstein wearing a seersucker: First seersucker sighting at #ComeyHearing! We see you, @SenFeinstein. 💯 pic. twitter.   —   ClotureClub. com (@ClotureClub) June 8, 2017,  UPDATE 10:57 A. M. Feinstein tells Comey he’s “big” and “strong,” then asks him if he was overwhelmed by the Oval Office and wonders why he did not tell the president he was wrong when he brought this subject up with him. He questions whether he would have handled himself the same way if given a second chance. “I hope there are tapes,” Comey also said of his meetings with Trump, noting he has seen the president’s Tweet about the possibility of tapes. UPDATE 10:55 A. M. Comey, under questioning from Sen. Dianne Feinstein ( ) says his relationship with Trump got off to a rocky start. He also embarrasses her when she asks him if the reason he was fired had anything to do with the Russia investigation, and he said “yes, because the President said so. ” Here in Union Pub, the   crowd broke out into laughter. UPDATE 10:53 A. M. Comey just killed the case against Trump over “obstruction of justice” that the media is building, as fast as they began building it. He said Trump saying he hopes Comey lets the investigation of Flynn go was not an order to drop the investigation. UPDATE 10:51 A. M. The media is highlighting two separate things early on in the Comey bonanza: The fired former FBI director’s use of the word “lie” twice, and him being concerned about meetings with President Trump. Establishment media going to do their thing. Comey has now used ”lie” twice. 1. Referring to WH defaming him and the FBI: ”those were lies”:2. His concern POTUS might ”lie” about mtg,  —   Katy Tur (@KatyTurNBC) June 8, 2017,  ”I was honestly concerned [Pres. Trump] might lie about the nature of our meeting.”  —   James Comey on why he kept records of his meetings pic. twitter.   —   Good Morning America (@GMA) June 8, 2017,  Flag: Comey doesn’t want to opine on Trump trying to obstruct, but says ”That’s a conclusion I’m sure the special counsel will work toward.” pic. twitter.   —   Kyle Griffin (@kylegriffin1) June 8, 2017,  An extraordinary thing for an   director to say about the President of the United States https:  .   —   Bradd Jaffy (@BraddJaffy) June 8, 2017,  UPDATE 10:48 A. M. Since Comey has nothing, and the whole case is falling apart, Hillary Rodham Clinton’s   Brian Fallon is sadly offering up that special counsel Robert Mueller is now investigating Trump. WH plan of declaring victory because Trump was not being investigated in January is now moot. Comey made clear Mueller is investing him now,  —   Brian Fallon (@brianefallon) June 8, 2017,  But, sadly, if they have no evidence Trump colluded with the Russians —  probably because it is likely no evidence even exists —  then the special prosecutor will find the same thing that Comey found: NOTHING. But, nevertheless Hillary Clinton’s acolytes persisted: Comey said he expects Mueller to assess, as part of his investigation, whether Trump obstructed justice. That would mean he’s a subject now.  —   Brian Fallon (@brianefallon) June 8, 2017,  UPDATE 10:40 A. M. Comey testified that he was “confused” about being fired by President Trump. And he said Trump spread “lies” about the FBI. Comey describes being “confused” by firing, “lies” about FBI being in disarray pic. twitter.   —   Washington Post (@washingtonpost) June 8, 2017,  UPDATE 10:38 A. M. Since Comey believes that no votes were altered in the 2016 presidential election —  he testified he is “confident” none were —  then what is the point of this hearing? #Comey says that he is ”confident” that no votes in 2016 were altered #ComeyHearing,  —   Brooke Singman (@brookefoxnews) June 8, 2017,  UPDATE 10:32 A. M. Despite the fact that Comey has nothing, but instead actually ended up in his written opening statement vindicating President Trump, the media elites in Washington are celebrating Comey’s “poker face” —  as if it means something substantive. James Comey’s poker face is savage. #ComeyTestimony,  —   Michelle Ruiz (@michelleruiz) June 8, 2017,  UPDATE 10:30 A. M. As Comey comes under questions from Burr, our very own Joel Pollak notes that Comey’s altered opening statement was a deeply personal statement furthering the giant nothingburger he put out last night through the committee. Comey failing again so far, just like he did when he was working on the Hillary Clinton email scandal last year. So far the Comey testimony is all about him  all about political retribution against the president for firing him. Disgraceful performance,  —   Joel B. Pollak (@joelpollak) June 8, 2017,  UPDATE 10:26 A. M. Washington, D. C. elites are having a ball for themselves.

It is packed to capacity for Comey. People are WHISPERING to order their drinks so they can hear the TV. pic. twitter.   —   Ryan Struyk (@ryanstruyk) June 8, 2017,  There are many more. We’ll get updates up soon. UPDATE 10:20 A. M. Audible gasps of disappointment were heard throughout Union Pub as Comey said he will not   his opening statement published online last night, a statement that completely vindicated President Trump. Comey, however, admits that the President can fire him whenever he wants. He also says that he heard Donald Trump thought he was doing a “great job. ” But here in Union Pub, cheers erupted as a champagne bottle was popped open for more Washington, D. C. mimosas. UPDATE 10:17 A. M. As Warner wraps his righteous opening statement, in which he stated “this is not a witch hunt” and “this is not fake news,” the STANDING ROOM ONLY crowd at Union Pub laughs as Comey is forced by the chairman to stand and be sworn in under oath for his testimony. UPDATE 10:15 A. M. This real life parody is getting more and more out of control. Fired  . S. Attorney from the Southern District of New York Preet Bharara is joining Comey in the hearing room. Yes, that is Preet Bharara sitting behind James Comey. Banquo’s ghost.  —   Charles P. Pierce (@CharlesPPierce) June 8, 2017,  Meanwhile, our COVFEFE LIVEWIRE has earned the attention of New York Times media correspondent Michael Grynbaum. Breitbart’s @mboyle1 is at Union Pub in DC to cover “the reaction of the crowd of Washington elites” https:  .   —   Michael M. Grynbaum (@grynbaum) June 8, 2017,  UPDATE 10:12 A. M. Mark Warner, the leading Democrat on the Senate committee, opens up with his opening statement saying that this hearing has drawn focus from a lot of Washington, D. C. and that ordinary Americans really don’t care and aren’t paying attention. Maybe Congress could focus on real policy issues when this charade is over, but that would probably be asking too much of our elected representatives. UPDATE 10:11 A. M. Fox News is reporting that President Trump is expected to issue a statement disputing parts of Comey’s testimony. UPDATE 10:10 A. M.
