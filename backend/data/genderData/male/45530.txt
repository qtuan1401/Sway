’’ ’Bloomberg caught up with the Vice President of China at the World Economic Forum in Davos on Thursday, and  rolling their eyes into the back of their heads.’ ’’ ’’ ’’ ’’ ’’ ’’ ’’ ’’ ’’ ’’ ’’ ”China doesn’t want to depreciate the yuan, it wants to defend the yuan. It spent $108 billion alone in December defending it despite significant depreciation, so you could even say the government really wants to defend the yuan.” ”There are a bunch of reasons for this, but chief among them is the government’s desire to prevent the most pressing problem with the country’s economy right this minute  —   capital flight. ” ”According to a report from the Institute of International Finance, $676 billion left China in 2015. It’s a huge number. To put it in perspective, all emerging market economies together saw outflows of $111 billion in 2014.” ’’ ”When the yuan depreciates, yuan holders have an incentive to exchange it for a currency that isn’t losing value. That market force only makes it depreciate more, and that’s bad for China because China has things to do with those yuan. It has a corporate sector to deleverage and restructure, it has a housing market to prop up, it has projects to fund.” ’And of course, conversely, if the yuan is steady, more people will buy or hold the yuan.’ ”So no. The Chinese government has no intention of depreciating the yuan even though the market seems to be begging for it. It just doesn’t feel like that to traders getting up in the middle of the night to check its value.” ’Or to Donald Trump, for some reason. ’
