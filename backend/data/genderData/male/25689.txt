.@realDonaldTrump on new $20 bill: Harriet Tubman is fantastic. .. It’s pure political correctness #TrumpTODAY https:  .  Thursday on NBC’s “Today,” Republican presidential   Donald Trump weighed in on the federal government’s decision to remove former President Andrew Jackson from the $20 bill for abolitionist Harriet Tubman.  Trump called Tubman “fantastic,” but described the decision as “pure political correctness. ” “Andrew Jackson had a great history,” Trump said. “I think it’s very rough to take somebody off the bill. Andrew Jackson had a history of tremendous success for the country. And as you know, they were going to do the $10 bill, and all of a sudden the Broadway play ‘Hamilton,’ you know the Broadway play saved that one. I read this morning it was going to be Hamilton. ” “I think Harriet Tubman is fantastic,” Trump said. “I would love to leave Andrew Jackson and see if maybe we can come up with another denomination. Maybe we do the $2 bill or we do another bill. I don’t like seeing it. I think it’s pure political correctness. He’s been on the bill for many, many years and you know, really represented somebody that was really important to this country. But we’d love to see another denomination and that could take place, I think. I think it would be more appropriate. ” Follow Jeff Poor on Twitter @jeff_poor
