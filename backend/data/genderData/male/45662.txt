Bernie’’s going to pay for everybody’’s college  —   can’’t happen,” he said, referring to US Sen. Bernie Sanders ( ).’ ’The billionaire investor added:’ ”Cuban, a frequent political pundit, said he hadn’t decided which candidate he would ultimately back.” ’But he is clearly not a fan of fellow Texan and Trump’’s top primary rival, Sen. Ted Cruz ( ). Over the weekend, Cuban even  as ”an ABC voter. Anyone But Cruz. ”’ ’Cuban, whose basketball arena  said he thought the billionaire developer was playing a bit of a ”game” with his television persona.’ ’He told Cavuto:’ ”Cuban additionally said that he thought some of Trump’s popularity was because of a proven record of success in business and real estate.
