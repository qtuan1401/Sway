In the last installment, we examined some positive historical precedents for a new president’s foreign policy.  In this installment, we will consider positive precedents for a new president’s domestic policy. [Next in a series,    1.  The Democrats’ Struggle to Remember Their Roots  For the Forgotten Man, and the Forgotten Woman, it’s nice to be remembered.  During the campaign, Donald Trump revived the phrase, “Forgotten Man,” which echoes back to the Depression years of the 1930s. Specifically, it harkens to Franklin D. Roosevelt, the great   champion of   Americans. As FDR said during the 1932 presidential campaign, while challenging incumbent Herbert Hoover —  who had presided over an   increase in unemployment during his single miserable term —  the crisis of the age was akin to 1917, when the US was forced to enter World War One: These unhappy times call for the building of plans that rest upon the forgotten, the unorganized but indispensable units of economic power for plans like those of 1917 that build from the bottom up and not from the top down, that put their faith once more in the forgotten man at the bottom of the economic pyramid.  [emphasis added] The American people appreciated FDR’s sense of urgency, which stood in stark contrast with Hoover’s        .  So in November 1932, FDR won a massive victory, carrying 42 of 48 states.  Thus we can see: The Forgotten People didn’t like being forgotten, and they were grateful to the candidate who cared about them.  Eight decades later, we were reminded of this same point: During the campaign, Donald Trump had plenty to say about the economy, and his message most hit home in the forgotten areas of the country.  For example, on October 21, in   Johnstown, PA, Trump said: Your government betrayed you, and I’m going to make it right.  Your jobs will come back under a Trump administration.  Your steel will come back. We’re putting your miners back to work.  In addition, Trump was respectful to, and attentive of, the industrial heritage of the region:  The iron and steel forged in your mills formed the backbone of our nation.  . . . This was the town that people flocked to from around the world to make their American Dreams come true. And so on Election Night, the victorious Trump, having Pennsylvania and other afflicted states, emphatically revived the Rooseveltian trope of yore, proclaiming, “The forgotten men and women of our country will be forgotten no longer. ” Remember my forgotten manYou put a rifle in his handYou sent him far awayYou shouted: “ ! ”But look at him today, Yes, it’s sad that the folks who have played by the rules, paid their taxes, and fought in the wars were forgotten —  as the forces of globalism, mostly cheered by the elites of both parties —  took their terrible toll. Then came Trump.   As we all know, he talked a different language, with a different set of issues, than the other 16 Republicans in the presidential race —  and he was richly rewarded.  And then came Trump vs. Clinton.    Hillary, Obama’s anointed successor, ran a campaign that could only be described as snobbish, curiously hostile to “deplorable” Middle America.  In the tart words of liberal novelist Mark Lilla, she thought she could win by ignoring America as a whole, and instead   favored blocs:  She tended on the campaign trail to lose that large vision and slip into the rhetoric of diversity, calling out explicitly to   Latino, LGBT and women voters at every stop. This was a strategic mistake.  If you are going to mention groups in America, you had better mention all of them.  If you don’t, those left out will notice and feel excluded.  Which, as the data show, was exactly what happened with the white working class and those with strong religious convictions.  Fully   of white voters without college degrees voted for Donald Trump, as did over 80 percent of white evangelicals. Indeed, the whole 2016 election can be seen as a battle between   insiders and   outsiders.  In the   words of Peggy Noonan, the voting was reflective of the distinction between the “protected” and the “unprotected”:  The unprotected people of America, who have to live with Washington’s policies, rebelled against the protected, who make and defend those policies and who care little if at all about the unprotected.  That broke bonds of loyalty and allegiance.  Tuesday was in effect an uprising of the unprotected.  It was part of the   against detached elites that is sweeping the West and was seen most recently in the Brexit vote. Hence the November 18 headline in Politico: “House Democrats lament     Some fear that the party’s move toward urban and suburban voters will eventually shut Democrats out of former white   strongholds. ”  In the words of Rep. Collin Peterson ( .) an increasingly lonely rural Democrat, “We’ve become an urban party. ” Indeed, for Democrats, a grimmer, and more realistic, mood seems to be settling in about not only geography, but also, ideology.  Thus this November 20 headline, also in Politico: “How the Left Created Trump: Nov. 8 represented an explosion of anger on the right at years of smugness and disdain by liberals. ”  In the words of writer Rob Hoffman:  As a bemused aside: Wasn’t it just yesterday that the Democrats, and their handmaidens in the MSM, were telling Republicans that they were doomed if they didn’t embrace multiculturalism and “comprehensive immigration reform”?  Yet as always, as James Carville famously said, “It’s the economy, stupid. ”  And so where were the Democrats on that issue?  Here’s where they were this year: busy dreaming up schemes to decrease growth.
