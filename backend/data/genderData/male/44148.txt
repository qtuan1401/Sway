You   think I’m bad for America?” ’ ’   ”Yeah,” Koppel replied flatly. ’ ’   In the testy    that followed, Koppel laid out   his chief complaint. ’ ’   ”You have attracted people who are determined that ideology is   more important than facts.”  ’ ’   After the segment aired, Hannity slammed CBS as ”fake edited   news.” ’ ’ ’ ’ ’t’t’t”Fake Edited News”   release the Unedited 45 minute interview so people can see the BS games you play in the edit room.
