’  ’ ’   Hours     ’ ’    ’ ’     The first part of McConnell’s wish came true: America got a new     president in Donald Trump. Whether the second part came to pass     remains up for debate. On paper, Trump may be America’s most     powerful Republican —  but that’s only because McConnell has     allowed him to take that role. And as soon as he tires of the     current arrangement, McConnell can swiftly reclaim the power he     has ceded.   ’ ’     McConnell, after all, mastered Trump’s nihilistic brand of     politics years ago; he is, in a sense, a   with the     same nihilistic thirst for power that drove Trump to the Oval     Office. He is much better at this game than Trump. And if Trump     attempts to defy or depose McConnell, he will not simply fail:     He will put his presidency at risk.   ’ ’     Although Trump and McConnell come across as polar opposites at     first glance —  McConnell’s stiff, dry demeanor is worlds away     from Trump’s shambling vulgarity —  their histories and     philosophies rhyme in curious ways. Like Trump, McConnell had a     pronounced liberal bent early in his political career,     supporting abortion rights and unions.   ’ ’     Like Trump, McConnell had no problem jettisoning these beliefs     when he realized the Republican Party was turning fiercely     against them. Like Trump, McConnell routinely attacks his     opponents on dubious grounds: He  one     rival for missing critical Senate votes for paid speeches (he     hadn’t, though McConnell later did) insinuated that another     was gay (he was actually just single) and suggested in     television ads that a popular challenger was addicted to     “” “powerful depressants” (he wasn’t).   ’ ’     Long before Trump started questioning Barack Obama’s     birthplace, McConnell had perfected the kind of baseless     personal attacks that, through the force of pure repetition,     gain an aura of plausibility. But just as importantly,     McConnell had coupled this viciousness with a total ideological     flexibility whose sheer audacity seemed to somehow mask its     rank hypocrisy.   ’ ’     McConnell proposed a constitutional amendment to limit money in     politics, then decided that the First Amendment protects     unlimited and anonymous political spending and contributions.     He voted for another constitutional amendment to     outlaw flag burning before deciding that flag desecration is     free speech. He took a hard line against China before receiving     huge sums from Chinese donors, at which point he became a     vociferous advocate for normalizing Chinese relations. Indeed,     as Alec MacGillis documents in his indispensable McConnell     biography  virtually all     of McConnell’s political convictions seem to derive from how     much money any particular vote will bring him.   ’ ’  ’ ’      Roe          Politico   ’ ’       McConnell, too, knows that the truth is vastly overrated and       that conventional wisdom overestimates the value of       consistency. These insights are coupled with an overwhelming       drive for power, no matter the collateral consequences. After       Obama’s election, McConnell, then Senate minority leader,              that his “No. 1 priority” was making Obama a “        president. ” He did not embark upon this mission because he       personally loathed Obama or feared his progressive politics.       He did it because Obama’s popularity stood between him and       his lifelong dream of becoming Senate majority leader, a       dream that could not be realized so long as Senate Democrats       were buoyed by their president’s popularity. McConnell       explained the strategy to his caucus with remarkable candor.       A fellow senator, the late Robert Bennett, recalled for       MacGillis what McConnell had said:     ’ ’       As MacGillis paraphrases this pep talk: “Wait out Americans’       hopefulness in a dire moment for the country until it curdles       into disillusionment. ”     ’ ’       McConnell’s campaign of obstruction flowed from this plan.       Senate Republicans, under McConnell’s leadership,        with unprecedented frequency, blocking routine appointments       to agencies, courts, and ambassadorships.     ’ ’  ’ ’       McConnell pressured moderate Republicans to refuse any       compromises over health care, stimulus, Wall Street reform,       and gun safety measures, and to join the blockade of key       Obama appointees for little reason other than a raw showing       of force. This part of the story is familiar, and it’s       especially poignant today, since McConnell’s obstruction              more than 100 judicial vacancies that were Obama’s to fill,       including a Supreme Court seat.     ’ ’       The animating intuition of McConnell’s obstructionism is that       the overwhelming majority of Americans do not much care about       Senate. They do not care about its traditions or daily       functions. They do not care about speeches or filibusters.       They do not care about amendments and debates and       reconciliations and all the parliamentary maneuvers that, by       all accounts, fascinate McConnell to no end. Most Americans       care only that the Senate “works” —  that it performs its basic       functions without collapsing into partisan squabbles.     ’ ’       McConnell recognized this fact early on, and also saw that       when the Senate seems not to be working, Americans tend to       blame the president. So, as minority leader, he brought the       Senate to a grinding halt, then blamed Obama and the       Democrats for his handiwork. This gambit was wildly       successful, sowing anger and frustrating toward Democrats,       and allowing McConnell to accrue an immense amount of power       despite his deep unpopularity, .     ’ ’       The animating intuition of Trump’s rise to power was that       Americans’ indifference toward politics runs a lot deeper       than perhaps even McConnell realized. As it turns out, a huge       chunk of the electorate does not care whether politicians       hold regular press conferences or release financial       disclosures or refrain from saying horribly bigoted things on       TV.     ’ ’       It doesn’t matter if a presidential candidate mocks or       vilifies disabled people and women and immigrants. It doesn’t       matter if he releases coherent policy papers and adheres to       clear positions on important issues. Americans —  or, rather, a       majority of the ones who matter, thanks to the Electoral       College —  just don’t give a damn about the formalities of       politics that the overpaid consultants told us were crucial.       Or at least, they don’t give a damn when your name is Donald       Trump.     ’ ’       But whereas McConnell developed his theory of the Senate       carefully, over the course of years, Trump essentially       stumbled into his own discovery all at once, then coasted to       the top on a wave of dumb luck. And that is the principal       distinction between the two men. Trump is an imbecile;       McConnell is a genius. Trump’s idiocy leads to a         stream of unforced errors; McConnell almost       never makes a misstep and calculates the risk of every       action. At some point, Trump’s luck will run out; McConnell’s       ingenuity will not.     ’ ’  ’ ’         That should terrify Trump, because once McConnell decides         that Trump is no longer useful to him, he will turn on him.         If Trump becomes mired in scandals that threaten to hurt         the Republican Party —  or challenges the supremacy of the         legislature over the executive —  his agenda will be in         serious trouble. McConnell has little use for an unpopular         president, even a Republican one, who won’t cooperate with         his plans. And if he does foil even part of Trump’s agenda         and bring Washington into gridlock again, Americans will         not blame him. They will blame President Donald Trump.       ’ ’         Therein lies McConnell’s ace in the hole. He knows the game         Trump is playing and has played a version of it himself. He         broadly agrees with Trump’s desire, mostly unarticulated         during the campaign but apparent in his actions since, to         slash the social safety net and nullify minority rights.       ’ ’         If Trump cooperates with McConnell, plays by the rules         McConnell lays out —  in short, treats the Senate as the         ultimate arbiter of the Republican agenda —  then the two will         get along just fine. But if Trump steps too far out of line         with McConnell, the wooden senator from Kentucky will         quietly ensure that the president suffers. Trump may be         “the most powerful Republican in America. ” But he will only         hold that title for as long as McConnell lets him       ’
