Donald Trump’s senior communications advisor Jason Miller blasted Hillary Clinton’s speech on Tuesday, saying her remarks were typical from someone who is “losing the election. ”[“Hillary Clinton’s remarks today in Tampa are exactly what you would expect to hear from a candidate who took off the month of August and woke up in September losing the election,” Miller stated, as a CNN released early Tuesday morning showed Trump leading Clinton.  Miller continued, “Clinton cannot escape the endemic corruption of the Clinton Foundation, which was exposed in a bombshell report today for violating New York state laws and regulations requiring disclosure of foreign contributions. ” Miller was referencing a Scripps News report that reveals Clinton’s charities didn’t follow a New York law requiring them to disclose millions of dollars from foreign donors.
