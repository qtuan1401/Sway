As the New England Patriots performed a miraculous    win to clinch another Super Bowl title, giving quarterback Tom Brady an historic fifth Super Bowl ring, liberals from coast to coast lapsed into despair that anyone close to President Donald Trump could become winners. [As soon as Patriots running back James White stretched over into the end zone to slam the pigskin down for that   touch down, liberals took to Twitter to vent their outrage.  Immediately the hash tag #notmysuperbowlchampion started trending with many slamming Brady and Trump.
