’  ’ ’   North Carolina’’s   legislature passed   measures on Friday that will significantly reduce the power of   the state’’s Democratic   in a move that has been   blasted by Democrats as a ”power grab” and prompted   protests. ’ ”   House and Senate lawmakers approved a bill that will give   Republicans control of the state elections board during election   years and prevent Democrats from controlling local boards of   elections, Raleigh’s . Gov. Pat McCrory signed the bill into   law shortly afterward. ” ”   The bill was one of several brought forward Wednesday to curtail     Roy Cooper’s authority. The others are still due   to be voted on. They would limit his ability to appoint cabinet   members, remove his power to appoint trustees for the University   of North Carolina, and dramatically reduce the number of state   employees he can hire and fire at will. ” ’   Democrats have fiercely criticized the Republican efforts, even   calling the bills a ”coup.” ’ ’   The changes go ”far beyond the normal partisan wrangling and   change of power,” Bob Hall, executive director of the nonpartisan   watchdog Democracy North Carolina, told . ’ ’’ ’   ”It’’s hard to defend the system when people act this way,” he   said. ’ ’   The protesters who rallied inside the legislature this week and   chanted ”all political power comes from the people” were so loud   that the Senate and the House were forced to clear the galleries   two days in a row, according to . At least 16 people were arrested Friday as debate   resumed. ’ ’   Cooper defeated the Republican incumbent McCrory in November   in a narrow race that McCrory refused to concede until last week. ’ ’   Cooper  on Thursday as ”unprecedented,”   and warned Republicans he will sue over any law that appears   unconstitutional. ’ ’   ”Most people might think that this is a partisan power grab. But   this is more ominous,” he said. ’
