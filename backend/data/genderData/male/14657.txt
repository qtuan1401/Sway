A television show about the terrorist group Islamic State aired by the international Saudi station MBC is stirring up controversy inside the kingdom and outside, particularly among the Syrian opposition. [The series, called The Black Crows, portrays among other things IS’s mistreatment of women, including the phenomenon of sex jihad, in which women join jihadist groups with the express purpose of being used for sex.  The show has a wide audience, but its producers have received harsh criticism with opponents saying the series gives Islam as a whole a bad name rather than the Islamic State itself. Despite news reports about the phenomenon, Syrian opposition journalist Moussa Alomar claimed on his Facebook page that sex jihad is not real, but an issue invented by the Al Mayadeen television channel  —   which is close to Hezbollah and Iran  —   in order to harm the Syrian opposition. Alomar sharply criticized the station and what he called the accusations of Muslim women who left their countries and made a long journey just to find sex in Syria. According to Alomar, he spoke with many religious scholars in Saudi Arabia about the series, but said they are hesitant to speak about the show out of fear they will be accused of supporting the Islamic State. Sheikh Muhamad Albarrak, a member of “The League of Muslim Religious Scholars,” also criticized the station and the show, tweeting that “MBC stopped the show The Price of Sins that examined the issue of marriage for sex among the Shia after the Shia complained, but it has no problem distorting the religion of the Sunnis and harming their pride. ” أوقفت #MBC عرض ”للخطايا ثمن” الذي ينتقد نكاح المتعةرضوخا لاحتجاج الشيعةأما المسلمون فتشوه دينهم وتفتري عليهم بعرض #غرابيب_سود دون مبالاة,  —   د . محمد البراك (@mohamdalbarrak) May 30, 2017,  Syrian activist Khaled Shaaban wrote, “The show The Black Crows tries to show Muslim women as thirsty for sex by showing them as being enthusiastic for what’s called sex jihad. ” مسلسل ”#غرابيب_سود” أراد أن يُظهر نساء السنة على أنهن نساء ”محرومات” و ”متعطشات” للجنس من خلال إقبالهن على ما قالوا أنه ”جهاد النكاح”.  —   خالد شعبان (@Khaled_qahtan) May 30, 2017,  Saudi academic and researcher Khaled Alalkami wrote, “The show The Black Crows portrays religious studies and the Quran as the reasons for terror and IS.
