’  ’ ’   The Cubs won the World Series, Donald Trump is the     and the rent in New York appears to be falling. ’ ’     In October, the  of New York City rentals that took a     price cut, according to the listing tracker Streeteasy, topped     42 percent —  the highest level since December 2010. The real     estate firm Citi Habitats, which draws data from its own     listings, reports that the vacancy rate in Manhattan has      to 2. 1 percent, its     highest level since 2009. Both of those indicators, in other     words, are back in Great Recession territory. ”It’’s a     renter’’s market right now,” says Chris Lee, the director of     sales at Triplemint, a real estate startup.   ’ ”     We don’t know yet why that is, or how long it could last.     Certainly, rents have outpaced incomes.   tenants     are less geographically selective than they used to be. New     construction has caught up with demand. But whatever the     reason, it looks like rents are about to dip . .. and then some.   ” ”     It is hard to overstate the impact of New York’s high     residential rents. They all but elected mayor Bill de Blasio,     whose campaign’s theme was correcting for inequality. They have     driven homelessness to record levels and continue to     monopolize the disposable income of millions of New     Yorkers. They have caused dozens of commentators to question     the city’s very identity as a haven for the castoffs and     dreamers of middle America and strivers from the rest of     the world.   ” ”       And because the problem of high rents is so general to       American cities right now, if New York’s rental bubble is       about to pop, it may offer a lesson to places like Los       Angeles.     ” ”       First, a caveat: It’s hard to generalize about rents.       Different brokerages pull data from different stocks of       apartments and report different findings. Some say New York’s       rents are already  than any         market in the country. Most say that prices       have softened or stabilized.     ” ”       But there’s reason to suspect that rents are on the cusp of a       larger decline. That discounts and vacancy are at a         high is part of it. But charts like the one below,       from Streeteasy, that show rents reaching a plateau are       likely a little behind the times. ” ’         For one thing, part of the shift toward a buyers’’ market         has been disguised by widespread and growing         ”concessions” —  landlords offering a month or two of free         rent, for example, but leaving the monthly rate the same.         In August, the New York Times  on this         phenomenon in Downtown Brooklyn, where a massive building         boom has seemingly created a new skyline overnight.         Nearly every building was offering one to four months of         free rent.       ’ ’         It’’s not just Brooklyn. According to Citi Habitat,          of         Manhattan transactions featured a ”concession” in         November 2016 —  meaning real, lower rates for tenants aren’’t         being reflected in rent data. The concession rate has more         than doubled since . Douglas         Elliman, another broker, reports that rents are down in         Brooklyn and Manhattan and also says that         concessions have  in both boroughs         from this time last year.* That is not part of the normal         seasonal downturn in rents that happens at year’’s end.       ’ ’         The other thing about market reports is that they are out         of date. They show how things were going six to eight weeks         ago. A sample of December listings shows an even sharper         decline.       ’ ”         Urban wonk Stephen Smith, tweeting at Market Urbanism,         some of         these listings. A Williamsburg  down to         $2, 500 from $3, 500 in 2014 —  with a free month’s rent. An         East Village  at         $2, 695 —  same as its rent in August 2009 —  and still unrented.         A Hell’s Kitchen  rented in         2014 for $3, 750, down to $3, 250, and still unrented. A          in Downtown         Brooklyn down 30 percent since July —  with two free months. A          in         Williamsburg down $600 from last year, with two months         free. A  overlooking         Prospect Park, down more than $600 to $2, 940 since it         was first listed in July —  and still available. A studio in         the West 30s  for less than it rented         in 2013.       ” ’         A three bedroom on the Upper East Side that, after eight         price chops, is back to its 2010 rent —  and down more than         $1, 000 since 2013. Oh, and the apartment comes with two         free months —  on a   lease (which, in a city where         rents were rapidly rising, would be more favorable to         tenants).       ’ ”           These are anecdotes, of course. I haven’t been to these           apartments; maybe they’re in bad shape. Maybe their           landlords got lucky, or greedy. But Smith’s point is that           this is all happening day by day. Those   graphs           are already propped up by developer concessions. And they           haven’t factored in drops like these.         ” ”           What’s more, if it is a glut, the glut is likely           just beginning. 2015 was a record year for           residential building permits in New York City —  with           developers pressed by expiring loopholes, the city           authorized nearly 35, 000 new units in the second quarter           and nearly 10, 000 more in the fourth. Total permits           topped 50, 000 —  more than any year since the early 1960s.           And many of them aren’t done yet —  according to the U. S.           Census Bureau,  of all           multiunit projects take more than 13 months from the           permitting date to be completed. One look at the skyline           will tell you that the city is still very much in           the throes of a building boom.         ” ”           That skyline in Downtown Brooklyn? That’s what a tenant’s           market looks like.         ”
