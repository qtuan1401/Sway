Republican presidential nominee Donald Trump is now polling ahead of Hillary Clinton, according to a new CNN poll released this morning.  Trump is now leading with 45 percent of the vote while Clinton is now at 43 percent. Libertarian candidate Gary Johnson has seven percent while Green Party candidate Jill Stein has two percent. Clinton’s eight point lead in August has effectively vanished, while Trump has staged a remarkable eight point turnaround. In August, Trump was polling at 37 percent. Part of Trump’s success lies in a 20 point lead among independents.   percent of independents now support Trump while only 29 percent support Clinton. Clinton’s numbers have dropped amid revelations about her testimony to the FBI about her deleted emails, while she spends more time on the trail attacking Trump. Trump, it appears, has turned around his campaign by focusing more on policy and community outreach. He is also now leading Clinton by 15 points on the economy, six points on terrorism. Hillary Clinton, however, is leading Trump by two points on immigration and 16 points on foreign policy.
