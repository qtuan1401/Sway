The first daughter wore a long dress with a   and purple pattern, and her blonde hair also was uncovered. The decision followed the recent tradition of visiting western dignitaries.

Many people are saying it was wonderful that Mrs. Obama refused to wear a scarf in Saudi Arabia, but they were insulted. We have enuf enemies,  —   Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) January 29, 2015,  When asked why neither wore a headscarf, the White House responded they were not required to wear them, according to CNN. It is the president’s first foreign trip while in office, and he and his delegation are being closely scrutinized for any missteps. The Trumps were greeted by a lavish   welcome ceremony, and received by King Salman himself and other top Saudi officials. A military brass band played, and a fighter jet flew overhead, highlighting the importance of the visit. Shortly after his arrival, Salman presented Trump with a gilded necklace and medal, the country’s highest honor.
