At a Monday campaign event at Eastern Michigan University, Sen. Bernie Sanders ( ) railed against Donald “Trump and the others” on the right who said “years ago” that “President Obama was not a legitimate president, was not born in the United States of America. ”  “We are going to win because our people are no longer going to fall for that nonsense,” Sanders told the crowd. Sanders did not mention, though, that Hillary Clinton’s campaign originated the birther controversy during her 2008 campaign against  . Barack Obama. As Breitbart News’s John Nolte has thoroughly documented, numerous mainstream media reporters and reports have confirmed that Hillary Clinton’s campaign actually started the birther controversy. Mark Penn, Clinton’s chief strategist in her 2008 campaign against Barack Obama, wrote in a campaign memo, “I cannot imagine America electing a president during a time of war who is not at his center fundamentally American in his thinking and in his values. ” He reportedly advised Clinton then that “every speech should contain the line that you were born in the middle of America to the middle class in the middle of the last century. ” Clinton also tried to “otherize” Obama when she infamously answered “as far as I know” when 60 Minutes asked if she believed that Obama is a Muslim. Trying to black voters in critical states like South Carolina, Clinton has embracing Obama’s legacy while slamming Sanders for criticizing Obama’s “progressive” credentials. Clinton has pointed out that Sanders said that it would be a “good idea” for Obama to face a primary challenger in 2012. and for having said that it would be a “good idea” for Obama to be primaried in 2012. At last Thursday’s PBS debate, Sanders said Clinton’s criticism was a “low blow” and replied, “One of us ran against Barack Obama. I was not that candidate. ”
