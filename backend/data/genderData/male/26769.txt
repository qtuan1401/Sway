Fashion industry public relations firm LaForce has canceled its annual holiday bash in New York City due to Donald Trump’s stunning victory over Hillary Clinton in this year’s presidential election. [According to the New York Post‘s Page Six, firm chief James LaForce and his husband Stephen Henderson sent out a letter to invitees stating that the annual industry party  —   originally set for December 19 at Manhattan’s Irving Plaza, with a one   guest list  —   would no longer be happening this year.  “We envisioned an   celebration of Hillary Clinton’s presidency,” the letter to invitees read, according to a copy obtained by Women’s Wear Daily. “Alas, Election Day did not go as we’d hoped. So it’s with deep regret that we are canceling this year’s party. ” “As Hillary said in her concession speech: ‘Let us have faith in each other. Let us not grow weary, let us not lose heart, for there are more seasons to come,’” the letter concluded, along with a promise of more parties in the future. The invitations to the bash, printed up before Election Day on November 8, had featured a caricature of Clinton wearing a red Santa hat and captioned with the words, “Make America Merry Again. ” The invitation called for guests to come dressed “patridiotically. ” LaForce  —   which includes among its clients such big names as Target, Banana Republic, Swarovski and Perry Ellis  —   had reportedly planned to incorporate nude male models painted with    body paint at the party. Now, the firm will instead donate the money meant for the party to progressive groups including Planned Parenthood, Housing Works and the Stonewall Foundation. “We just decided we couldn’t go through with it,” James LaForce told the Post.
