In wake of Russia’s alleged meddling in the 2016 election, “The Resistance” special commentary for GQ magazine’s Keith Olbermann said Monday that Americans are the “victims” of a Russian coup enabled by “traitorous” Republicans who are indifferent in wake,  “We are at war with Russia,” Olbermann began. “Or perhaps more correctly, we have lost a war with Russia without a battle. We are no longer a sovereign nation, we are no longer a democracy, we are no longer a free people, we are the victims of a bloodless coup  —   so far a bloodless coup engineered by Russia with the traitorous indifference of the Republican Party. ” Olbermann went on to say that America is about to be handing over all of its freedom to “Russian scum. ” “[P]ermitting Donald Trump to assume the office of president reduces the chance that we will have any future elections,” he added. “The nation and all of our freedoms hang by a thread, and the military apparatus of this country is about to be handed over to scum! Who are beholden to scum! Russian scum! As things are today, January 20th will not be an inauguration, but rather the end of the United States as an independent country. It will not be a peaceful change of power. It will be a usurpation, and the usurper has no validity, no credibility, and no authority under the Constitution. ” (  RCP Video) Follow Trent Baker on Twitter @MagnifiTrent
