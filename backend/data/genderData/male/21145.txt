Ivanka Trump reportedly wore a $138,   dress from her own fashion line  —   sold at Macy’s and Nordstrom  —   when she introduced her father Donald Trump on Thursday night at the Republican National Convention in Cleveland, Ohio, where he accepted the Republican Party’s nomination for President of the United States. [The    fashionista also wore her own dress on Wednesday night.  “The entrepreneur was also sporting her own designs  —   $158   dress, $135 black suede pumps and her own considerably pricier precious jewelry  —   in the Quicken Loans Arena on Wednesday night, when photographers shot her pointing toward her father’s nemesis Ted Cruz,” Women’s Wear Daily reports. Trump’s decision to adorn her reasonably priced clothing line makes her relatable to every woman and it’s in stark contrast to presumptive Democratic nominee Hillary Clinton’s decision to wear a $12, 485 Giorgio Armani jacket during her New York primary win in April. As the New York Post noted, Clinton’s jacket reveals her disconnect from the everyday woman. “It was a clear attempt to position herself as an everywoman,” the Post reported of Clinton’s victory speech, adding, “But an everywoman she is not  —   she gave the speech in a $12, 495 Giorgio Armani tweed jacket. ”
