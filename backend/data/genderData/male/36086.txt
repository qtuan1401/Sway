But he has reluctantly endorsed him, heralding him as better than the alternative, Hillary Clinton. Rubio had suggested when he entered the Senate race that this decision was coming. ”I’ll have to   that now that I have a campaign to run in Florida. I’ll have to spend a lot more time there and a lot less time    I’ll have a lot less free time,” he told CNN’s Manu Raju.
