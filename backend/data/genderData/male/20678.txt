  actress Lena Dunham says she has received “more hostility” from supporters of democratic socialist Sen. Bernie Sanders than she ever has from conservatives. [Speaking to a group of around 200 people at a Clinton campaign event at NeueHouse in Hollywood on Sunday, the    feminist and star of HBO’s Girls said, “I have received more hostility for voting for a qualified female candidate than I have ever received anywhere from the American right wing. ”  According to Variety, she added: “The fact that other members of the Democratic Party have spoken to me like I was an   child for voting for someone who represents everything I think this country should be is outrageous. ” Dunham, who has vigorously campaigned for Hillary both online and on the trail, claimed she has received “vitriol” on her Instagram page. She said that she reached a “tipping point” a week ago when a commenter wrote to her, “Bernie Sanders has done more for feminism than Hillary Clinton has. ” Dunham, who falsely accused an innocent man of rape in her 2014 memoir, appeared at the Clinton event with actress America Ferrera and Clinton’s daughter Chelsea. Later at the event, Chelsea Clinton accused Republican frontrunner Donald Trump of normalizing “hate speech. ” “The sexism, the racism, the Islamophobia, the homophobia, the   rhetoric, the references to Americans with disabilities. The list goes on and on,” Chelsea said. “And it is now almost so common as to be treated an unexceptional. I think all of us should always take exception to any of that. ” Dunham’s accusing the left of “hostility” and “vitriol” comes as thousands of   protesters in multiple states have taken violent and extreme measures to shut down Trump campaign events. Aside from a handful of isolated incidents, Trump supporters and other conservatives on the trail have remained peaceful, despite sometimes physical attacks from the left, and their portrayal as aggressive in the media.
