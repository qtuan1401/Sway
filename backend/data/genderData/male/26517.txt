[The Florida senator confirmed reports in an interview with the Miami Herald, citing the importance of holding a Republican Senate majority for his decision.  “I think that the point that really drove me to change my mind is that as we enter this kind of new chapter in our history here is, there’s another role the Senate plays that I think can be really important in the years to come,” Rubio said. “And that’s the power given to it in the Constitution to act as a check and balance on the excess of the president. It’s even more important given the fact that control of the Senate could very well come down to what happens in the Florida race. ” “Poll data shows that Marco Rubio does by far the best in holding onto his Senate seat in Florida,” he wrote on Twitter in May. “Important to keep the MAJORITY.

Two other competitors, Sarasota developer Carlos Beruff and Orlando defense contractor Todd Wilcox, remain  —   though Rubio would become the instant  . A Qunnipiac poll released this morning showed that Rubio currently leads potential Democratic challenger Rep. Patrick Murphy by seven points and Rep. Alan Grayson by eight points.

It is unclear whether all of Rubio’s potential Republican challengers would abandon their campaigns. Rep. David Jolly dropped out of the Florida Senate primary race on Friday. Rep. Ron DeSantis and Florida Lt. Gov. Carlos   have indicated that they would bow out of the race if Rubio ran.
