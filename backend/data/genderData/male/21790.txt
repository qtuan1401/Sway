She fielded just four questions, but by definition, it was a press conference. [Pressure from the Breitbart audience and Republican presidential nominee Donald Trump flushed the Democrat presidential nominee out into public, where she will continue to field softballs from the fawning liberal media, but will also have to answer tough questions from real journalists relevant to determining her ability to occupy the White House.

Now that she is out of hiding, perhaps the American people will finally get some answers to those lingering questions. She’s got a lot to answer for. The #HidingHillary series of articles amplified the voice of the Breitbart News audience to make the “run out the clock” strategy unworkable. Breitbart News readers were encouraged to tweet their questions and comments to @DustinStockton and use the hashtag #HidingHillary. For several weeks, the Breitbart News audience has delivered a variety of witty, tough, pertinent, and entertaining material.
