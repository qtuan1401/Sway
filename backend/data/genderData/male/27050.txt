With just one month left before closing out 2016, Cameron Jacob and his Twitter handle thesenuts365 look like a   winner for most imbecilic tweet of the year. [The message called Monday’s heinous   attack, which left one victim dead and eight injured on Ohio State University’s campus by a Somalian refugee, an act of karma leveled on the university for their football team cheating against Michigan during Saturday’s rivalry game.  Ohio State University cheats during Michigan game. Campus gets shot up the following school day.  Karma or Nah? ὄ🐸🍵#Karma,  —   Cameron Jacob (@thesenuts365) November 28, 2016,  The   contest ended in a   victory for OSU after a controversial first down ruling in favor of the Buckeyes in a second overtime period. Jacob, who incorrectly referred to the tragic campus incident as a shooting, defended the despicable tweet as no worse than some of   Donald Trump’s tweets during his campaign against Hillary Clinton. Donald Trump said way worst shit than whatever I’ve said about the state of Ohio. 😏#JudgeMeIfYouWant,  —   Cameron Jacob (@thesenuts365) November 28, 2016,  Jacob confessed that he does have a track record for making dumb remarks: The funniest thing is this ain’t the dumbest shit I’ve said all year. 💁  —   Cameron Jacob (@thesenuts365) November 28, 2016,  To top it all off, the overly zealous fan may also have a penchant for making racial statements as well: Donald Trump didn’t give a fuck about France getting shot up by ISIS. But y’all mad at me tho? Right lol. I got it White America 👌  —   Cameron Jacob (@thesenuts365) November 28, 2016,
