’  ’ ’   A longtime aide to former President Bill Clinton said Chelsea   Clinton was ”acting like a spoiled brat” in a 2011 email   published by  in the organization’’s ongoing release of emails from   John Podesta, Hillary Clinton’’s campaign chair. ’ ’   The aide, Doug Band, was emailing Podesta and longtime Hillary   Clinton aide Cheryl Mills about a negative story about his   consulting company, Teneo. ’ ’   A difference of opinion between Band and Chelsea Clinton was made   apparent in the email, but it was not clear what the difference   was. ’ ’   ”I realize it is difficult to confront and reason with her but   this could go to far and then we all will have a real serious set   of other problems,” Band wrote. ”I don’’t deserve this from her   and deserve a tad more respect or at least a direct dialogue for   me to explain these things.” ’ ’   ”She is acting like a spoiled brat kid who has nothing else to do   but create issues to justify what she’’s doing because she, as she   has said, hasn’’t found her way and has a lack of focus in her   life,” he continued. ”I realize she will be off of this soon but   if it doesn’’t come soon enough. ...” ’ ’’ ’   Band worked as an adviser in the Clinton White House and was   instrumental in both the Clinton Foundation and the Clinton   Global Initiative. ’ ”   The Clinton campaign and the Democratic National Committee have   alleged WikiLeaks is working    with the Russian   government in an attempt to throw the US presidential election to   Republican nominee Donald Trump. While it hasn’t confirmed the   validity of past emails released by WikiLeaks, the Clinton camp   has not denied their accuracy. ”
