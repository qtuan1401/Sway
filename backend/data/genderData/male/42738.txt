San Francisco (CNN) Add San Francisco’s mayor to the chorus of voices questioning the sheriff’s decision to release an undocumented immigrant with a long criminal record without telling U. S. immigration officials. The man, Juan Francisco   has been charged in last week’s shooting death of Kate Steinle on one of San Francisco’s busiest piers. He’s a repeat felon who has been deported to Mexico five times, according to immigration officials. Mayor Ed Lee said   should never have been back on the street. ”Nothing in that law prevents or prohibits communication, notification with our federal and state law enforcement officials,” Lee said at a Wednesday news conference.  ”Is this a gap? Do I need to educate somebody about how to pick up a phone?” San Francisco County Sheriff Ross Mirkarimi said he was under no obligation to call immigration officials. ”The mayor would be subverting, sabotaging his own law . .. that was passed by the Board of Supervisors and that he signed into effect in 2013,” Mirkarimi told CNN affiliate  .   ”It’s very clear that it stipulates to law enforcement, in this case the sheriff’s department, that a notification detainer request should not be returned unless ICE (Immigration and Customs Enforcement) also provides a court order or a warrant.” Because the feds didn’t come with either, he let the accused killer go. Immigration officials had only requested that the sheriff’s office let them know when   was released.

S. immigration laws and the role local authorities should play in enforcing them.

Republican contender Donald Trump has blamed immigration policy for Steinle’s death. Another Republican, Jeb Bush, agreed, saying such policies encourage crime. In an interview Tuesday with CNN, Democratic presidential hopeful Hillary Clinton said San Francisco should have listened and made a mistake when it didn’t send   packing. ”I have absolutely no support for a city that ignores the strong evidence that should be acted on. . ..  If it were a   traffic citation, if it were something minor, a misdemeanor, that’s entirely different,” she said. ”This man had already been deported five times. And he should have been deported at the request of the federal government.” Immigration and Customs Enforcement said   has seven felony convictions, four for drug offenses. His most recent deportation was in 2009. On Tuesday,   pleaded not guilty to murder and weapons charges. His bail was set at $5 million.  What is a ’sanctuary city,’ and why should you care?
