On Friday’s broadcast of “PBS NewsHour,” New York Times columnist David Brooks argued that especially with Israel and Russia   Donald Trump is “siding with a foreign leader against the US president. ”  Brooks said, “What’s sort of remarkable is that, especially in the Israel and the Russia cases, you’ve got a US citizen, Donald Trump, siding with a foreign leader against the US president. There is a reason why   have tried to remain mute during their transitional periods, relatively, because you just don’t want to be for somebody  —   some other country against your own government, and especially when you’re about to take the helm of that government.
