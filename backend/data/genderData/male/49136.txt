’  ’ ’   President Barack Obama delivered an impassioned plea to voters in   North Carolina to vote next week and reject the candidacy of   Republican nominee Donald Trump. ’ ’   ”We won’’t win this election, potentially, if we don’’t win North   Carolina,” he said during a campaign rally for Democratic nominee   Hillary Clinton. ”I hate to put a little pressure on you, but the   fate of the republic rests on your shoulders. The fate of the   world is teetering.” ’ ”   In his speech to voters in the Tar Heel State, the president   emphasized how crucial North Carolina’s 15 electoral votes are to   Clinton’s path to capturing the 270 electoral votes needed to win   the White House. ” ’   Obama repeatedly laid into Trump, one sentence after another,   saying that he had ”no respect for working people,” mocking his   claim that he has a”good brain,” and lambasting the Republican   presidential nominee’’s plan to bar all Muslims from entering the   US. ’ ’’ ’   ”What I can tell you is that we can’’t afford a president that   says we should torture people, or that should ban entire   religions from our country,” Obama said. ’ ’   The president also raised the 2005 video of Trump boasting about   kissing and forcing himself on women without their consent.  ’ ’   ”If you disrespect women before you are elected president, you   will disrespect women when you are in office,” Obama said.  ’ ’   He added: ”Imagine what you’’ll actually do when you have to the   power of the Constitution along those lines.” ’ ’   Obama also noted how congressional Republicans have already   mulled investigations and a  over her use   of a private email server while serving as secretary of state. ’
