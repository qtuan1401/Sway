Huma Abedin, the closest aide to Democratic presidential nominee Hillary Clinton, helped edit a Muslim journal that published negative statements about Jews, including accusing Jews of “working the American political system” and exploiting the Holocaust. [The Daily Mail reports that Abedin was assistant editor of the Journal of Minority Muslim Affairs for 12 years, even after she joined Clinton’s team. Her mother was    and her brother and sister edit it as well.  The Daily Mail notes: The magazine’s views have continually clashed with the ideological principles in which Clinton has rooted her political career, including articles embracing   homophobic,   and   views. One article, published during Huma Abedin’s tenure, claimed that many Americans have a ‘distorted and negative view’ of Islam, Muslims and Arabs  —   ranging from perceptions of ‘poverty, filth, the desert’ to ideas that ‘their ‘sport’ (other than sex, of course) is to destabilize Western economies and ruin the world in order to master it’. The piece from 1999 also alleges that there are deep ties between the upper echelons of U. S. politics and     suggesting that Jewish people have been able to ‘work the system’ and are ‘greatly aided by the American memory of the Holocaust’ and Israel serving as America’s ally in the Middle East. Other articles in the journal reportedly blamed the U. S. for the   terror attacks, and featured retrograde views on the status of women and   families. Abedin has claimed she was merely listed on the masthead and played no active role. The revelation comes as Hillary Clinton prepares to deliver a speech in Reno, Nevada on Thursday, attacking Republican nominee Donald Trump for his perceived support from members of the “ ” movement.
