Vice President Joe Biden revealed during a campaign rally that he had a military aide with the nuclear codes present at the event. [“There’s a guy that follows me right back here, has the nuclear codes,” Biden said, turning and pointing. “So God forbid anything happened to the president and I had to make a decision, the codes are with me. ”  After Biden bragged about how the nuclear codes were with him, he said that Trump was “not qualified” to know the nuclear launch codes. He said Trump was not worthy of being the commander in chief, reminding the audience that his son Beau served in Iraq. “I must tell you, had Donald Trump been president, I would have thrown my body in front of him,” Biden said. “No I really mean it. ” Biden insisted that Trump’s presidential campaign was already endangering American soldiers stationed overseas. “If my son were still in Iraq and I say to all those who were there  —   the threat to their life has gone up a couple clicks,” he said.
